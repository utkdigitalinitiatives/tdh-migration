In the letter, Elizabeth discusses  social events taking place in Jackson, such as marriages and parties, as well as events taking place with the people in their family. She asks her daughter not to ride on horses because she could get injured, and to always tell them the truth because they need to trust her while she is away from home.</note><note type="collection">Chester Family Papers MS 25 (March-April 1841)</note><note type="box">1</note><note type="folder">8</note><note type="document">um070</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker;
