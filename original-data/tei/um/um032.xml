If I do not receive one soon, I will not write to you again until you write to me. I believe that is the best way after all to take it time about, but I will write you this one as I want you to send me some things by Aunt Narcissa. I wish that you would get me a Purple <orig reg="Merino">Marino</orig> &amp; have it made high up in the neck &amp; send it by her There are no handsome ones here nor any good milliners. have it made longer in the waist than any other Dresses. Cousin <name type="person">Jane</name> purchased me a Bonnet <orig reg="last">lat</orig> week and had it lined and <orig reg="trimmed">trimed</orig> very <orig reg="prettily">prettyly</orig>. Cousin <name type="person">Elen</name> has persuaded me not to wear Draws but if you think that I had better wear them you can send them. Every Saturday I answer my letters and mend my clothes. Sometimes when I am mending them I get <pb n="[3]"/> so much <emph>Bothered</emph> that I do not know what to do. You see that I have been so used to going to you to show me that it goes harder with me. But I expect that I will learn how to shift for myself by &amp; by. Sending me from home I am convinced is the best thing that ever was done for me. If I could only see you all often or even hear from you <orig reg="more often">oftener</orig> I should be happy. O! I forgot to ask you to send me the Cherries that you spoke of before I left home if you can get them made in time. Give my love to Pappa and kiss all of the children. Give my love to all of my relations.</p><closer><salute>I remain your affectionate Daughter</salute><signed><abbr expan="Mary Jane">M.
