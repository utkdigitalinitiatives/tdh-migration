I need not inform you with what delight yours was received, and with what pleasure I saw that my dear Brother had not forgotten me. I intend to answer his letter very soon. I feel much obliged  <sic corr="to">to to</sic> for the  Money which you sent. I believe that I have not before acknowledged the receipt of it.</p><p>There has been very great excitement in this place, concerning the Comet, Our <emph>little</emph> Rector has examined it with his Telescope, and has arrived at the conclusions that it  nearer the Earth, than any has been known, within a considerable length of time, I dont remember exactly the period. I think it truly a beautiful phenomenon. We have had a snow <pb n="[2]"/> on the ground for the last two weeks, of the depth of several inches, which rendered the walking to School extremely unpleasant. One week we were all obliged to take holiday. I have taken some very fine sleigh rides. This is the first spring day that there has been this month, I really fear that we shall have no flowers  <sic corr="or">or or</sic> which is more distressing no fruit. At least unless the weather greatly changes. There is an old weather <orig reg="Wizard">Wizzard</orig> living here, who has predicted one more snow this Spring, which will be <emph>six feet deep</emph>, but I must confess that I have not much faith in his predictions. <name type="person">Cousin Sam</name> will be in <name type="place">Jackson</name> next week. Oh! you have no idea how sincerely I wish that I was in his <del type="overstrike">his</del> place for indeed it appears to me, that I should be perfectly, happy if I could see you all again, but I console with the idea that I have only three more months to be <orig reg="separated">sepperated</orig> from you. Why does not  <name type="person">Aunts <abbr expan="Narcissa">N</abbr></name> and <name type="person">Patsey</name> write to me, Tell them they are both in debt to me for one letter. Ask Aunt <abbr expan="Patsey">P</abbr> for me if Home does not feel very dear to her, as she has been away from it; I suppose she is capable of judging. Certainly There is no place like Home: but do not infer from this that I am not pleased with <name type="place">Columbia</name>, on the contrary I like it <emph>very much</emph> indeed; I greatly prefer boarding with <name type="person">Cousin Ellen</name> than at the Institute, for it is too confining. I want you to kiss Sam &amp; the Children as often as you can possibly spare time to do it in. Give my very best love to <emph>all</emph> my dear Relations.</p><closer><signed><name type="person">Mary Chester</name></signed><pb n="[3]"/><add place="above address"><figure><figDesc>post mark seal</figDesc></figure> 18</add> <address><addrLine><name type="person"><abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Robert J.
