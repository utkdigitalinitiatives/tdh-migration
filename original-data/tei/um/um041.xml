I could tell you about sickness &amp; disease, <orig reg="melancholy">melancholly</orig> feelings &amp; lonely moments, but I am recovering from all of these fearful ills I trust. Just about now I think that it would take some extra <orig reg="occasion">occassion</orig> to drive dullness away from Paris, by the way we are to have a temperance celebration, speech, procession <abbr expan="et cetera">&amp;c</abbr> here tomorrow. I have not determined whether I shall attend.
