I am very anxious to take Guitar lessons, by taking one lesson on the Piano and two on the Guitar in a week, will have to pay exactly the same price as if I were to take whole lessons on the piano, and I think that I should learn equally as much. If it is not perfectly agreeable to you, I should rather not commence. They sell very cheap. <name type="person">Mr Smith</name> has very handsome ones for $25.
