I need not tell you I am very busy as now is the most <del type="overstrike">I</del> important time in my course and I have very little time to write and I hope you will excuse me on that account. Dear Brother I will not ask any more questions of Sister <name type="person">Mary</name> or any body else to know how I am to get away from here for I know one already and will trouble you or myself any more about it so be easy on that Point. Dear Brother &mdash; I need no inducement to stay here for I would not go for the world and I was very angry that you said you would send <name type="person">Alex</name> to <name type="place">Yale <orig reg="College">Colege</orig></name> as an inducement for me to stay here so I your humble <orig reg="servant">servent</orig> would be much <orig reg="oblige">ablige</orig> to you if you would never name such a thing again.

Dear Brother you see I am willing to stay here for this reason. Sending you the regulations and even <name type="person">uncle Jackson</name> is in my <orig reg="favor">favour</orig> but still my Brother John cannot be satisfied when I do <del type="overstrike">w</del> not write like I was a Methodist Parson, and if you my Dear Brother cannot  put up with my dull, complaining style as you call it (which I do not intend). I cannot with yours for shame. A young man who is just going to join himself in wedlock with an amiable &amp; handsome young lady to complain of his Brother who is at a distance from home who wishes to make a little fun and who you take for a dull, complaining style you must not be so <orig reg="suspicious">suspitious</orig> and more so to me in my <emph>situation</emph>. now I will tell you we have no amusements or pleasures but studying &amp; as the snow and ice covers the ground, the Ice on the ponds is about three inches thick, and it is a little amusement on Saturday Evenings but I do not go for this reason it is the only day I have to write unless I <orig reg="encroach">encro &caret; <add place="supralinear">a</add> ch</orig> on my studies &amp; you ask whether I <orig reg="correspond">corespond</orig> with uncle.

I feel as I have done something wrong, said some thing very wounding to your feelings, or said some thing I ought not to , some thing I would not to have done for the world. Oh John do not write so any more if you can help it for my sake and feelings at this moment I feel my heart as is it was ready to burst after reading your last letter. Do save my feelings by writing no more such letters, tell me at once what I have said <orig reg="incorrect">incorect</orig>, for I <del type="overstrike">am</del> now feel as if I could go where no human face could see me do leave of writing any <orig reg="more">mo</orig> such Letters</p><p>Give my love to all my relations and accepts of the same</p><closer><salute>from your Brother</salute><signed><name type="person">Andrew</name></signed></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
