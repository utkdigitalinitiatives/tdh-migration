Chester, on December 29, 1842. In the letter, Mary Jane discusses her examination in January and her hopes that some of her family will be there for it. She also mentions to her father that the rumors regarding her engagement to an unnamed man are unfounded. She concludes the letter by expressing love to her family and asking her father to burn the letter once he had read it, which he obviously did not do.</note><note type="collection">Chester Family Papers MS 25 (January-December 1842)</note><note type="box">1</note><note type="folder">10</note><note type="document">um084</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Boarding school students</item><item>Tennessee -- History</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/>  <opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Columbia Tennessee</name></addrLine><addrLine><date value="1842-12-29">December 29th 42</date></addrLine></address><salute>My dear Papa,</salute></opener><p>I am happy to hear from your kind letter that all the dear children were so much better.</p><p>I suffered great uneasiness and anxiety about them   <sic corr="until">until until</sic> I received your last, indeed you cannot imagine how sincerely I have wished to be at home so that I could assist you and <name type="person">Aunt Narcissa</name> in nursing them.
