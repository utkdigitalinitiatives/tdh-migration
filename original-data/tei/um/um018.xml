                <p>I received your letter of the 2nd <abbr expan="instant">inst</abbr> a few minutes
                    ago and hasten to answer you I am very much obliged to you for the trouble you
                    have been at in attending to my affairs with <name><abbr expan="Robert"
                            >Robt</abbr> Warren</name>. I left the notes with <abbr

                    <name type="person">Simpson, McAlister &amp; <abbr expan="Company"
                        >Co</abbr></name> for collection in <date value="1849-04/05-00">April or May
                        1849</date>. One of the notes fell due on the <date value="1849-07-01">1st
                        of July</date> of that year and the other on the <date value="1850-01-01"
                        >1st of January 1850</date>. With verbal instructions to make the money when
                    it fell due and although I have written repeatedly to the house of <abbr

                    been able to hear from them but once and then they informed me that the notes
                    had been put into the hands of <name type="person">Mr Irvine</name> for
                    collection. I greatly fear that the gentleman have so far neglected my interest
                    any instructions as to cause me to lose a good deal of my claim if so and I have
                    any hold on them at law I will make them smart for it, however that is "inter

                    and will most likely go by Saturday.</p>
