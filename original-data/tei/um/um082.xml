Chester, on November 13, 1842. In the letter Mary Jane tells Robert of events going on in Columbia, Tennessee, where she is attending school at the Female Institute, and inquires about events happening at home in Jackson. She tells him how upset she is that he did not visit her when he promised, and she also speaks of their cousin's new baby, visiting with Governor Polk, and the death of her mother. Mary Jane concludes the letter by asking him to bring her a black muslin when he comes to visit her.</note><note type="collection">Chester Family Papers MS 25 (January-December 1842)</note><note type="box">1</note><note type="folder">10</note><note type="document">um082</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Boarding school students</item><item>Tennessee -- History</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/>  <opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Columbia Tennessee</name></addrLine><addrLine><date value="1842-11-13">13th <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr> 1842</date></addrLine></address><salute>My dear Father,</salute></opener><p>I received yours of the 5th <abbr expan="Ultimo">Ult.</abbr> with very great pleasure, and hasten to answer it, as some time has elapsed since I last wrote, knowing that you would have an opportunity of hearing from me of <name type="person"><abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> Polk</name>, I thought it not necessary to write before.
