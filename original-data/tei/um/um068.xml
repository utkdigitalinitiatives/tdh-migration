So I expect that you will receive his letter before you do mine. The <name type="person"><abbr expan="Reverend">Rev</abbr> Mr Wheat</name> of <name type="place">Nashville</name> was here: and read out the Composition.</p><p>Father you requested me in your last letter not to write so many letters. I will discontinue all my letters to every person with the exception of our family. I was very much distressed when I read that part of your letter. I did not think that I had ever written any thing that I would not be willing for any person <pb n="[2]"/> to read. I am very glad that you have told not to write. I will do any thing that I think would please you and Mama I know the reason that you did not speak of it when you were here. You did not like to speak of any thing that you thought would give me pain.</p><p>I do not think that I can graduate this Summer. I wish that you would write to Mr. Smith about it. <orig reg="Oh">O</orig>! I should like to graduate so much. I study as hard as it is possible for any one to study. Next session I will try and get the Premium in <orig reg="diligence">dilligence</orig>, but I should like for that to remain a secret.
