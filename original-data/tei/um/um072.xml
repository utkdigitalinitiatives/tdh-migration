I received your very <abbr expan="affectionate">afft.</abbr> letter a day or two since. You do not know how much pleasure it gave me to receive it. If I could receive such letters as that is every week I should be <emph>almost happy</emph>. I also received a very kind and interesting letter from <name type="person">Uncle Will</name>. I need not say how much I was pleased with it.  I am very happy to hear that <name type="person">Aunt Patsy</name> is recovering her health so fast.  I hope that she will be so well that her &amp; Uncle can come up to my Examination.  Tell <name type="person">Aunt Narcissa</name> I wish very much to be at home so that I could go a <emph>fishing</emph> with for we always have so much pleasure.  Why does she not write to me? I shall look for a letter from her next week &mdash; if I do not receive it shall be very much disappointed &mdash; I have been very <orig reg="busily">buisily</orig> engaged for the last two weeks in writing my French exercises &mdash; we have six or eight to write every <pb n="[2]"/> evening &mdash; I am very much pleased with the study of French.  I was very much astonished, I must confess at hearing of so many marriages, I had no idea that <name type="person">Miss McIver</name>  was going to be married &mdash; but "strange things will happen sometimes."</p><p>Mamma you need not be uneasy about my clothes, for I have as many as I have any use for, though I am very glad that you intend sending me a dress, for scarcely any of mine will suit the weather. I want to purchase a Calico dress &mdash; but thought I would wait until you would tell what kind I had better get.  all my dresses that I have are too short waisted &mdash; If you have any made please have them longer <sic corr="in">in in</sic> that respect only. I do not think that I have grown any in height.</p><p>Mamma you made an earnest request of me in your last letter, that I would not ride on horse back until I see you.  <emph>I will promise you that I will not</emph>. I have discontinued my riding lessons, and have taken Embroidery in the place of it &mdash; I like to take it very much.  the most pleasant evening that I have spent since I have been here was in the Embroidery room.  I am very glad to hear that Sis was pleased with her Pants.</p><p>O! how much I should like to see our little <emph>Walking</emph> and <emph>almost talking</emph> brother <name type="person">Sam</name>. I know that he looks very sweet You must let him know that he has such a sister as I am.  it would please me very much if would learn to call my name. You excuse this very short letter.  but as it is the 1st day of April &mdash; &amp; most of the girls are writing April fools I concluded that I would have much more pleasure in writing to you, so you see that I have no time to <orig reg="writing">writin</orig> any more.  Give my love to Papa &amp; all my relations kiss the children for.
