               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Governor
				John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Benjamin Hawkins, agent and
				superintendent to the Creek Nation, dated April 26, 1797. Sevier wrote the
				letter on behalf of a woman by the name of Lillean Williams, who was taken
				prisoner by Creeks several years ago. While under Creek supervision, Williams
				had given birth to a daughter, and since the girl was born in the Creek Nation,
				she was not released with her mother. Sevier requested that Hawkins make
				enquiries regarding the whereabouts and possible release of the girl, who was
				then eight years old.</note>
