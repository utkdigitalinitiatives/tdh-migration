               <note type="summary">This document is a copy of a letter, dated
				September 29, 1795, by Chickasaw chief Piomingo (indicated in this letter as
				Opy Omingo and Opoia mingo) that was written to General James Robertson and
				sent to Colonel David Henley. Piomingo wrote this letter as a plea to the
				United States government for assistance. Hostility existed between the
				Chickasaws and the Creeks, and the letter described an attack by the Creek on
				the Chickasaw Nation. Although the Chickasaw were able to hold off and defeat
				the Creek, they endured considerable losses. Piomingo urged Robertson to think
				of Chickasaws as the brothers of Americans and that brothers should want to
				help each other in times of need. The Chickasaw chief asked for troops and
				provisions to be sent to his nation.</note>
