               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written to Andrew
				Jackson, with copies also being sent to Joseph Anderson and William Claiborne,
				by Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on November 19, 1797. In the
				letter, Sevier describes the murder of two Indians. Sevier says that the Indian
				people of the area are distressed over the murders, but promise that no
				retaliation for the murders will occur. Sevier explains that several people
				have left the area, while others remain and refuse to leave. Sevier asks
				Jackson for his support in dealing with the distressed people.</note>
