				Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to James Robertson, Lachlan McIntosh and James
				White, dated September 16, 1798. This letter was written to inform the three
				men that the Cherokee are preparing to enter into a treaty with the United
				States commissioners. Sevier instructed the men to attend the treaty meeting
				and represent the interests of the state of Tennessee, particularly in regards
				to the settlers who have been removed from their plantations because they
				resided within Indian land boundaries.</note>

			 <name type="place">United States</name>, appointed for that purpose;
			 permit me to request, that you will immediately repair to the treaty ground,
			 and attend to such matters and things as materially concern the welfare and
			 interest of this State, particularly to the early relief of the unfortunate
			 people, who has been removed from their plantations, and at the same time keep
			 in view the instructions, I before gave the Agents, on the general and various
			 subjects touching the treaty.</p>
