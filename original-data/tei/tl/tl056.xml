               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Tennessee
				Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on April 1, 1804, and addressed to
				the white inhabitants residing on lands reserved by the US government for the
				Cherokee Indians. In the letter, Sevier informed the settlers that by
				encroaching upon the Cherokee's lands, they were violating the laws of the
				United States and the treaty between the US and the Cherokee Nation, and he
				warned them that if they continue there, they would be forcibly removed from
				the land. Sevier also announced that he was hopeful that the Cherokee claims to
				lands in northern Tennessee would soon be extinguished and that, furthermore,
				it would be possible to acquire from the Cherokee lands to the east of the
				Mississippi River in exchange for land west. Sevier also encouraged the
				settlers to venture out onto the great expanse of land newly acquired from
				France instead of maintaining ideas of remaining on Cherokee lands. </note>
