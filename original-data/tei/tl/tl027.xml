               <note type="summary"> This document is a letter addressed to the
				warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, written by Governor John Sevier of
				Tennessee (1796-1801) and dated January 12, 1797. The letter was given to
				Cherokee agent Silas Dinsmore to be read aloud to the Cherokee. In his letter,
				Sevier accused some Cherokees of stealing horses and plundering wagons that had
				passed through the Cumberland road. Sevier laid the blame on "foolish young
				people" within the Cherokee Nation but hoped the chiefs and warriors were not
				encouraging such acts. Sevier urged the Cherokee leaders to work with Dinsmore
				in getting the stolen property returned. Sevier also expressed condolences for
				the murder of an Indian and stated that he doubted any of his people would do
				such a thing. The letter was initially ended on a note of warning to the
				Cherokee, as Sevier insinuated that if they continued their aggressive
				behavior, war would be option. However, the last two sections of the original
				letter were deleted from the final text.</note>

			 <name type="place">Cumberland</name> road; such conduct will soon
			 darken the bright chain of friendship that now so happily is joined to each
			 nation. I hope you that are Warriors and chiefs, do not encourage such
			 proceedings, and I have a better opinion of you, than to Suppose you would any
			 longer Suffer it to be done.  You have no reason to think I wish any
			 ill, neither does the great majority of the white people, in case your nation
			 will be friendly. You know I have always advised you, not to let foolish young
			 fellows destroy the good understanding between us. I request you will proceed
			 to make inquiry after the <lb/> horses <pb n="[2]"/> horses and other property
			 that have lately been taken by your people <del type="overstrike">and if you

                        <add place="supralinear">and</add> send the same into

			 will pursue such measures as will enable you and him to recover the Stolen
			 property.
