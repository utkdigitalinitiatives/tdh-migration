               <note type="summary">This document is a letter addressed to the
				warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, written by Tennessee Governor John
				Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809 ) on March 28, 1797. Sevier reported that he had
				been requested by the Governor of Kentucky to have the two Tennessee citizens
				who murdered Red Bird and another Cherokee apprehended and sent to Kentucky to
				be tried for their crime. Sevier stated that he had sent forth orders in
				compliance with this request, and he was now urging the Cherokee leaders to
				capture those from amongst their people who were responsible for the murders of
				several white citizens. Sevier warned the Cherokees of the dangers of bringing
				about a war, which could be the consequence of further acts of aggression
				between the citizens of the United States and those of the Cherokee Nation.
