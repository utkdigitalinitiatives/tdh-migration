               <note type="summary">The following document is an undated letter
				addressed to the chiefs of the Creek Nation, which appears to have been written
				on behalf of the white settlers living along the Shawnee River. In this letter,
				the settlers appear to have been making an offer of peace with the Creeks. The
				letter states that the Chickasaws, who were in good relations with the whites,
				had informed the settlers that the majority of the Creek people wished to be at
				peace with them. However, the letter refers to several instances that were
				looked at as being acts of aggression by the Creeks, including the theft of
				some horses and the loss of white lives. The letter also mentions an instance
				in which the settlers stumbled upon a deserted Indian camp and retained the
				horses and other articles from that camp, securing them until it was known to
				what tribe they belonged. The settlers contend they moved to the West with the
				intention of being at peace with all the tribes there, nor, they state, do they
				wish to encroach upon Indian lands or molest Indian peoples. </note>
