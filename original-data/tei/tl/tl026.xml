               <note type="summary">This document is a letter, dated January 12,
				1797, written to Silas Dinsmore, agent to the Cherokee, from Governor John
				Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801). The letter was written partly in response to
				inquiries made earlier by Dinsmore regarding Indian land boundaries in the
				Cumberland area. Sevier explained that Americans could begin settling in areas
				as low as the Tennessee River and that the settlements boundary line the
				government was experimenting with was going to be extended. Sevier devoted the
				second half of the letter to discussing problems between the white settlers and
				the Cherokee, by stating that several complaints had been made about robberies
				and plundering believed to have been committed by some Cherokees. Sevier
				expressed disdain toward this conduct and feared it would hinder peace. Sevier
				also enclosed a letter he had written to Cherokee chiefs.</note>
