               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Governor
				John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801) to Secretary of War James McHenry, dated
				January 17, 1797. Sevier reported that the companies of Captains Wade and
				Sparks had arrived, but were incomplete. He requested three companies of
				infantry and a troop of cavalry be sent as well in order to protect the
				frontier settlers and scare the Indians. Sevier also informed McHenry that
				several families had their horses stolen and wagons plundered along the
				Cumberland road, and he had written to Cherokee chiefs and their agent to
				prevent such acts. Sevier ended his letter by claiming that he would endeavor
				to prevent encroachments upon the hunting grounds of the Indians.</note>
