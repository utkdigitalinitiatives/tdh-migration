               <note type="summary">This document is a letter, dated November 11,
				1815, written by Joseph McMinn, Governor of the state of Tennessee (1815-1821)
				addressed to the Senate and House of Representatives in Washington DC. In his
				letter, Governor McMinn informed the House and Senate that he had enclosed for
				their consideration a copy of an agreement between the United States (by Agent
				William Cocke) and the Chickasaw Nation concerning the opening of a road from
				Reynoldsberg. Governor McMinn wrote that the United States would not bear any
				of the expenses of opening the road. Governor McMinn stressed that the road
				would not only be of importance to the citizens of Tennessee, but also to those
				of Kentucky and Ohio.</note>
