One of the<name type="place"> New Orleans</name> papers (the Argus) received here yesterday, says the <abbr expan="General's">Genls</abbr> reception was cold &amp; indifferent, that the streets were comparatively deserted as walked them; no demonstrations of Joy or satisfaction welcomed him, except from a few hot headed <orig reg="partisans">partizans</orig> <abbr expan="et cetera">&amp;c</abbr> which makes the administration men of this town (and there are a good many) hold up their heads and excitingly taunt us with disappointment. On the contrary the "Advertiser" says the <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> was welcomed by a greater concourse of people than was ever <del type="overstrike"><unclear></unclear></del> assembled in the City; which I have no doubt is true; also a cousin of mine, a commission merchant of the city writes me that business of every description was suspended during the old <orig reg="hero's">heros</orig> stay &caret; <add place="supralinear">among</add> them. Such are the accounts of  celebration in New Orleans, and each party believes that which digests best upon his stomach. <name type="person">Mr Clay's</name> pamphlet is another cause of triumph with the Adams <pb n="[2]"/> men in this section; but I have some facts &amp; arguments " laid up in ordinary" as <name type="person">Mordecai</name> says, which are strong as the decrees of <emph>Fate</emph>, that I intend to bring out in about two weeks, perhaps sooner. I have never yet, except in one instance, and that you did not see, made an attempt at display on this subject, for the reason that were so many scribblers employed in the business that a sober &caret; <add place="supralinear">or moderate</add> man has scarcely any chance to be heard. I intend to bring forth a production this time that will command attention.&mdash;</p><p>I want you, the first leisure half day you have, to sit down and read the 18. 19 and 20th Numbers of <unclear>Scriblerus</unclear> in the West Tennessean, and say if I am not at home some future day, to gain immortality for the invention or discovery of a new system of <emph>Philosophy</emph> on <emph>Magnetism</emph>! I have been about three years at work at it, in conjunction with a friend, and have at length matured it, and do most <orig reg="sincerely">sincerly</orig> believe it will eventually take; I have gained a number of converts in this country. I have the finest looking, the smartest, and the keenest-eyed son in the state, now six weeks old. I call him, after my friend, <name type="person"><abbr expan="Samuel">Saml</abbr> Houston</name>; and think he will succeed him in his office in less than 35 years.</p><p>It is the prevailing opinion, and common to talk here that <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Carroll</name> is to be the opposing candidate at the next Gubernatorial election, and I much fear it <pb n="[2]"/> will even be the case, in that event much exertion will be necessary, for he is a mighty man, I find, amongst the <emph>folks</emph>. But I am gradually gaining an influence with and an extended circulation of my paper, and <orig reg="think">thing</orig> by prudent management, I will be able by that time to yield a considerable influence, if I am able to keep up &caret; <add place="supralinear">my office</add>  but unless I can make or rather <emph>collect</emph> more money than I have hitherto been able to do I do not know whether I can keep along or not.&mdash; I looked for some particulars on the subject of which we talked when I was in <name type="place">Nashville</name>, before you went below, but I suppose the hurry of preparation for so important an affair prevented it. I addressed a letter to<name type="person"><abbr expan="Colonel"> Col</abbr> James I. Green</name> on the subject, but received no answer, the cause of which I cannot account for. Be so good as to throw together all the materials you think  necessary, and forward them to me as soon as convenient, I am anxious to perform that task, and have the vanity to believe I can do it <emph>tolerable</emph> Justice.</p><p>Desha &amp; <name type="person">Brent</name>, I understand, are going to <emph>fight</emph>, I think it nothing but right that Brent should be slapped for his impertinence, and I reckon none of the Tennessee delegation are better are better calculated to do it than <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Desha</name>.</p> <closer><salute>I remain dear sir with real esteem &amp; respect Your <abbr expan="obedient servant">obt servt</abbr></salute><signed><name type="person">G.
