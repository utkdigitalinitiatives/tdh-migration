				John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Cherokee agent Return J. Meigs, dated
				August 2, 1807. In the letter, Sevier discussed the murders of two white men,
				John Prigmore and Leonard Cash, committed, presumably, by Indians. Sevier
				expressed his condemnation of such acts and also his hopes that the Cherokee
				Nation will investigate the crimes and apprehend the culpable party if
				found.</note>

               <p>you will perceive by the enclosed copy of a letter, from

			 <name type="person">John Prigmore</name>, has been lately murdered,
			 by the Indians </p> 
		  
               <p>A certain 
			 <name type="person">Leonard Cash</name> was also murdered last Spring
			 in the neighborhood of 
			 <name type="place">Flint River</name>, and afterwards found in the 
			 <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, with his body <orig reg="ripped">riped</orig> open and head cut off, with other mutilations of an
			 egregious nature . I have been further informed (not official) that one
			 other person has been murdered near 
			 <name type="place">the Shoals</name>, said to be done by the 
			 <name type="person">
                     <orig reg="Creeks">creeks</orig>
                  </name>. Such
			 enormities are of too <orig reg="aggravating">agravating</orig> a kind, and
			 such as will not be longer suffered, to be committed on any of the citizens of 
			 <name type="place">Tennessee</name>. I request you will be good
			 enough to make diligent enquiry in order to discover the perpetrators that they
			 may be dealt with agreeably to existing Treaties, and the laws in such cases
			 made and provided. I am unwilling to believe that the Cherokee chiefs would
			 countenance such outrages, but should it be discovered to be otherwise, this
			 situation may soon become very disagreeable, unless they finally put an end to
			 such aggressions. I shall expect that the Cherokees will make every necessary
			 enquiry to dis<add place="bottom right">cover</add> 
                  <pb n="[2]"/> the offenders,
			 and if found among their own people, to make an immediate Surrender of the
			 Guilty person or persons  In so doing they will wipe away the foul stain
			 that seems to be hanging over their nation
