               <note type="summary">This document, entitled "Account of a Battle Axe
				Taken from an Indian at the Battle of Long Island Flats in 1776," is the
				description of a Tomahawk rendered to the Historical Society of Tennessee by
				Alfred H. White. According to White's story, which was related to him by Mr.
				George W. Netherland, the Tomahawk was believed to have belonged to a Cherokee
				known as "Big Indian" on account of his stature and status. During this East
				Tennessee Revolutionary battle, an American soldier by the name of Moore came
				in contact with "Big Indian" during a charge. The two engaged in a one-on-one
				conflict, which eventually resulted in Moore defeating and killing the
				Cherokee. The referred to Tomahawk was found near where the action took place
				and was further believed to have belonged to the "Big Indian" because of its
				large size. The document was received by the Historical Society of Tennessee on
				January 6, 1860.</note>

               <p>The supposed tradition of this Tomahawk is that at the battle of

			 When ordered to charge a man by the name of

			 chiefs of the 
			 <name type="person">Cherokee</name> nation known from his immense
			 statue  well developed farm as the "Big Indian," 
			 <name type="person">Moore</name> was the stoutest man belonging to
			 the American party, their rifles being uncharged they clinched immediately, the
			 Indian being the most active threw 
			 <name type="person">Moore</name> near a sinkhole and both
			 <orig reg="rolled">rooled</orig> into to it 
			 <name type="person">Moore</name> having turned the Indian in the
			 scuffle, The Indian drew his knife when 
			 <name type="person">Moore</name> grasped his wrist outminded
