				Return J. Meigs to General Andrew Jackson written on July 6, 1816. Meigs is
				telling Jackson about a convention he attended with the Cherokees in order to
				establish the boundary line of their land. He says that the lands given up by
				the Cherokee will benefit both the Cherokee and the United States because of
				land-holding and monetary issues.</note>

               <p>I was at the City when the Convention with the Cherokees was made
