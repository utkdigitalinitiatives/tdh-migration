               <note type="summary">Letter with sworn statement dated April 3, 1834 from John Smith in the Aquohee District to the (Cherokee ?) Delegation, concerning a property dispute. A portion of the property that Smith claims as his own was awarded to a man named Hosea Morgan, a recent emigrant to the Arkansas who claims to be Catawba, and Smith believes that Morgan has no right to this property since he is not a citizen of the nation nor Cherokee. He has presented his case to Major Curry, but has received no satisfaction and is now petitioning the delegation.</note>
