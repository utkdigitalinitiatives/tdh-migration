               <note type="summary">Copy of a treaty form for negotiations between the Cherokee Nation and the United States. The treaty pertains to the removal of the Cherokees east of the Mississippi River. The treaty articles listed detail payment for land, improvements, and loss of crops and release of Cherokees who have been seized, as well as the logistics of emigrating. The date 1838 which appears on the treaty form is dubious in light of historical record.</note>
