               <p> I am directed by the President to assure you, and through you the Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, that he has the best disposition to afford Every Encouragement in his power to the benevolent Efforts of the society, to diffuse knowledge  civilization among our Indian neighbors;  that he views, with approbation, the judicious measures which have already been adopted by the Board to Effect these objects.</p>
               <p>The public lands, after the Extinguishment of the Indian title, being Entirely under the disposition  control of Congress, that body, only, can give the assurance desired by the Board, as to the disposition which may be made after an extinguishment of the Indian title, of the lands on which the schools of the missionaries may be Established.</p>
               <p>The agent for the <name type="place person">Cherokee nation</name> will be directed to furnish as great a number of the ordinary implements of husbandry  of domestic manufactures, as, in his opinion, the exigencies of the school already Established there may require.</p>
               <p>So the four youths which are now with you, on their way to the school in Connecticut, one hundred<pb n="[2]"/>dollars a year will be allowed to Each, while at school, provided the term of their tuition does not exceed four years.
               </p>
               <p>The assistance requested in erecting a corn mill near each station will, if practicable, be afforded.</p>
               <p>As it is the wish of the President that the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> should be the permanent  home of the <name type="person">Cherokees</name>, he would be particularly friendly to the Establishment of schools among the <name type="person">Cherokees</name> there, and will render such aids as the public interest  the state of the Indian appropriation may permit.</p>
