                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>Perhaps I have already intruded too much upon your time.  The probability that I shall not see you before the sum appropriated to the instruction of the Indians is specified is my apology for troubling you with this communication.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt of the disposition of the <abbr expan="Secretary" type="contraction">Secy.</abbr> of War, or of the President to <orig reg="favor">favour</orig> my object, so far as their acquaintance with it will enable them to confide in the wisdom of the design,  in the skill  fidelity with which it will be executed.  I only regret that I have not been able to state more fully the motives which induced  the very respectable society, which I have <orig reg="honor">honour</orig> to serve, to direct their attention to the instruction of Indians,  which have influenced my own mind to engage in the service.  I designed to have made the statement when I called on the President, but no convenient opportunity offered.</p>
               <p>The settlement of this country by our forefathers, has in various ways proved <orig reg="disastrous">disasterous</orig> to the natives, <orig reg="notwithstanding">nowithstanding</orig> the laudable exertions, both by the government  individuals to counteract such a result.  Very different have been the consequences to ourselves.<pb n="[2]"/>considering therefore the relation in which we stand to these people, it has appeared no less an act of justice, than a dictate of humanity  a duty enjoined by the the gospel, to extend <add place="supralinear">to</add> them as far as is practicable the distinguished advantages which we enjoy.  This duty is incumbent on individuals  on societies, as well as on the government.  And it was supposed that the exertions which government are making to accomplish this object, could not be better aided, than by instructing the rising generation.  It is no less the dictate of sound reason, than the result of past experience, that exertions of this kind are the most effectual means to secure  the confidence of the Indians,  to give security to our frontier settlements.
               </p>
               <p>These are some of the motives which have led to the present undertaking,  to an application to government.  It was supposed that when the views of the Board of Foreign Missions should be understood, the object would be approved,  so far patronized by the Executive, as the existing provisions of Congress,  the present state of the undertaking would authorize.  I do not ask for any appropriation for myself, or for any persons who may be employed in the schools, but merely for the erection of suitable buildings,  for providing those implements of husbandry  of the mechanic arts, which may render the establishment respectable  useful.  Nor is it wished that any money should be appropriated otherwise, than through the government agent residing in the tribe.  With these brief  hasty remarks I cheerfully submit the subject to your decision.  </p>
