               <note type="summary">This document is a letter from Principal Chief John Ross to David Irwin and Thomas G. Barron, lawyers retained by the Cherokee Nation to pursue their claims against the state of Georgia, dated October 3, 1830.  Ross indicates that the Cherokee people have rejected a recent treaty proposed by John F. Schermerhorn, regarding it as unjust and oppressive.  They intend to press their arguments further and express good faith in their legal representation.  Ross writes that he still has faith in the magnanimity of the U.S. government and maintains hope that removal can be avoided.</note>
