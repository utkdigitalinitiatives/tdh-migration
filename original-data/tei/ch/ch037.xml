               <p>Your letter of the <abbr expan="2nd" type="brevigraph">2d.</abbr> instant upon the subject of establishing schools in the <name type="place person">Cherokee Nation</name> has been received.  The President approves of the undertaking  will direct such aid to be given as the laws will permit.</p>
               <p>In the first instance the agent will be directed to erect a comfortable school house,  another for the teacher  such as may board with him, in such part of the nation as shall be selected for that purpose.  He will also be directed to furnish two ploughs, six hoes  as many axes, for the purpose of introducing the art of cultivation among the pupils.</p>
               <p>Whenever he is informed that female children are received  brought into the school,  that a female teacher has been engaged capable of teaching them to spin, weave sew, a loom  half a dozen spinning wheels  as many pair of cards will be furnished.  He will be directed, from time to time, to cause other school houses to be erected, as they shall become necessary,  as the expectation of ultimate success shall justify the expenditure.</p>
               <p>The houses thus erected  the implements of husbandry  of the mechanic arts which shall be furnished will remain public property to be occupied  employed for the benefit of the nation.  If the persons who are about to be <add place="supralinear" cert="appears to be different ink and hand">engage</add> employed in this enterprize<pb n="[2]"/>should abandon it, the buildings  utensils which shall have been furnished may be occupied by any other teachers of good moral character.
               </p>
               <p>The only return which is expected by the President is an Annual Report of the state of the school, its progress  future prospects.  This Report should present the mode of teaching  the deviations from that practised in civilized life, which experience shall render necessary.  Should you succeed according to your expectations, it is probable that the attention of congress will be attracted to the subject; and that the means of forwarding your beneficent views will be more directly  liberally bestowed by that enlightened body.</p>
