               <note type="summary">This is a letter from Joseph McMinn, U.S. agent to the Cherokee Indians at the Cherokee Agency in Tennessee, to John C. Calhoun, Secretary of War, dated October 27, 1824.  McMinn reports to Calhoun on the claim of Mr. Elsworth, superintendent of the Brainerd Mission, and the Cherokee Nation that they are due funds for the construction of a building to house female students at the mission school.  McMinn refers to previous correspondence between Return J. Meigs, his predecessor at the Cherokee Agency, and Calhoun on this matter.</note>
