               <note type="summary">This document is a copy of a letter from Colonel Joseph Martin, at Chotee, to Richard Caswell, Governor of North Carolina (1776-1780, 1784-1787), dated September 19, 1785.  Martin reports that he has assumed the duties of Indian agent (to the Cherokees) and has a considerably difficult summer due to frequent encroachments by inhabitants of the state of Franklin, as well as meddlesome talks from the Spaniards and the western Indians.  He mentions the former British agent, Mr. McDonald and his relationship with the Chickamauga Cherokees, Alexander McGillivray, and the Creeks.</note>

               <p>"I am now on the duties of the office (Indian Agent) and have had more trouble with the Indians in the course of the Summer, than I ever had, owing to the rapid encroachment of the people from the New State (<name type="place" reg="State">Franklin</name>), together with the Talks from the <name type="person">Spaniards</name> and the western Indians.</p>
               <p>Two <name type="person">Wyandot</name> Chiefs are now at <name type="place">Chickamagga</name>, etc.-</p>
               <p>The Indians here are much concerned at the people living on <name type="place">Little River</name>, I refer your Excellency <pb n="[2]"/>to their talks which they have <orig reg="counseled">counciled</orig> on for six days.
               </p>
               <p>I have with much pains and some artifice prevailed on <name type="person">Mr. McDonald</name>, the former <name type="person">British</name> Agent, to correspond with me.  I have enclosed a copy of his letter to your Excellency in case of a war with any foreign power. he may be very service<add place="supralinear">a</add>ble or very dangerous.</p>
               <p>He lives about <hi>25 miles south west</hi> from <name type="place">Chickamagga</name>.  Which is the <unclear>
