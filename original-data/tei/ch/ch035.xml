               <p>Ere this I suppose that you will have <abbr expan="received" type="contraction">recd.</abbr> the Extra Circular of the Commissioners and the <orig reg="Superintendent">Superintendant</orig> of <name type="person">Cherokee</name> removal together with a copy of <name type="person">Mr. Harris</name>'s letter which I sent you by the last mail.  from appearances I have no hopes that you will be able to effect any thing on any other basis than that of general removal.  If this be the case. the grave question presents itself what will be best <add place="supralinear">to do</add> under all circumstances. two alternatives only presents itself to my mind. to Stay and be forced off under the false treaty, or to treat on the basis of general removal.  under such circumstances I would say let us make a treaty. if the details could be made more satisfactory <add place="supralinear">to</add> us.  that is if we can get a longer time given to remove in the money placed under the control of the Nation and left free to move to whatever place we may choose the greatest difficulties must follow in either cases, but the latter course in my own opinion would be best for us.  we can expect Nothing else but oppression from the <abbr expan="Government">Govmt</abbr> of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> So long as we remain in their limits. and if we had the means It may be possible that we could find a Country. out of the <name type="place">United States</name> Which we might live in.  I can <add place="supralinear">well</add> imagine the situation the delegation are placed in the people expect you to do the best you can for them. under <add place="supralinear">the present</add> 
                  <del type="overstrike">all</del> circumstances It will be impossible to please all. and the time seems to be at hand when something must be done and<pb n="[2]"/>that without much delay.  I have not heard from you since your <add place="supralinear">letter</add> dated <date value="0000-00-16">16 <abbr expan="Ultimo">Ult.</abbr>
                     </date> we are all <orig reg="laboring">labouring</orig> in great suspense to hear our final doom. there is very little business going on in the immigrating line.  the late Extra Circular wont have the desired effect of those who issued it.  all are waiting to hear from you.
