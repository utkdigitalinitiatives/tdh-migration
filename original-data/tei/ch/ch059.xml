               <note type="summary">Cherokee Council minutes from May 20 to May 27, 1818 wherein several issues related to a recent treaty (Treaty of the Cherokee Agency, July 8, 1817) are discussed. The Cherokees request provisions such as guns, blankets, and kettles that were promised to them in the treaty, and there is a discussion about the census that is planned for June. An address made by the president to General Talentisky (Talohtiske ?) and others of the Arkansas Delegation to Washington concerning Cherokee removal and land in Arkansas is read to the Council. Also, a question and answer session regarding the recent treaty and specifically concerning reservations is held, wherein Cherokee leaders Walter Adair and Thomas Foreman raise issues.</note>

               <p>To which his Excellency made the following reply</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Friends and Brothers Your request relative to furnishing the young men and Boys with arms is founded upon the highest authority known to the <name type="person">American</name> Government and shall be attended to with cheerfulness and <orig reg="promptitude">promtitude</orig>  Notwithstanding the power and Authority with which I am invested on this point is <orig reg="indefinate">indeffinite</orig> as relates to age or size: You must permit me to exercise that Authority with an eye to the interest of my Government as well as that of yours and I do assure you that an unbiased discretion shall be my Guide.</p>
                  <p>I will select one from a <gap reason="document damaged">
                        <pb n="[3]"/>Those young men and Boys whose height shall be marked on the doorpost of the <name type="place">United States</name> Store House as a standard: and it must be distinctly understood that no guns will be furnished to any whose <orig reg="height">hight</orig> shall fall below the standard measure nor will any Blankets or Kettles be furnished to Boys under this arrangement but will be kept in reserve for the widows  children you have just now brought into view.  <orig reg="To">Too</orig> whose wants I am authorized by your Father the President to make adequate Provision.  But as to withholding the Kettles and Blankets from the poor warriors, it <orig reg="cannot">can not</orig> be granted they are secured to them by the 6th Article of the late Treaty which must be regarded in the most solemn manner and let it be remembered that the Guns given to the Boys and the Kettles and Blankets given to the widows and Children form no part of the Treaty, but are presents made to your people as a sure mark of your Fathers Goodness and friendship toward the red people

Among other things he stated: by the terms of the Treaty the <orig reg="census">sensus</orig> of the whole Nation is to be taken in the month of <date value="0000-06-00">June</date> next as <add place="supralinear">well</add> those who reside on the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> as those who reside on the East of the <name type="place" reg="River">Mississippi</name>; and that he wished to have this talk over in time for them to return to their respective houses before the Arrival of the Period at which the <orig reg="census">sensus</orig> is to be taken, when you are at your houses My Brothers (he added) a correct account can be taken of your numbers, and the opportunity at least is not so great for the <orig reg="commission">comission</orig> of Errors in taking the<pb n="[5]"/>
                        <orig reg="Census">Sensus</orig> and more accuracy can be Observed than in any other situation in which you can be placed, and I hope my Red Brothers (he added) that the course I have taken will be entirely satisfactory to you to which they all nodded assent

                              <p>My Friends and Children I am very glad to see you when we are face to face we can understand the wishes and intentions of each other without any danger of mistake I have long known your Friendship for the white people and it is my wish to make you and your Nation happy  The Country you gave us is a good Country and it is near and convenient to us and I <pb n="[6]"/>shall in return act generous towards you and <orig reg="endeavor">endeavour</orig> to make you happy in your new homes on  the <name type="place">Arkansas</name>.  I have not yet obtained the lands lying up that River to the west of your settlement I will give instructions to <name type="person">Governor Clark</name> to hold a Treaty with the <name type="person">Quapaws</name> this Summer in order to purchase them and when purchased I will direct them to be laid off for you.

                              </p>
                              <p>It is better for you and us, that all of the <name type="person">Cherokees</name> should go to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name>.  We should be then kept more apart and bad people would not have the power to excite quarrels between us.  If  however any should choose to remain I will treat them with Justice.</p>

                  <p>His Excellency very satisfactorily explained to the Council, those parts of the above address which they did not understand; and among other things (he added) that this address was intended by their Father the President to apply to the whole Nation though delivered to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> Delegation.  That the President of the <name type="place">United States</name> knew nor recognized no Division of the <name type="place person">Cherokee Nation</name>; nor will any division be noticed by your Father the President <orig reg="until">untill</orig> the Enumeration is taken and the Annuities apportioned between the <pb n="[8]"/>Arkansas and those who may remain East of the <name type="place" reg="River">Mississippi</name>.
                  </p>
                  <p>His Excellency then proceeded to read the Treaty as ratified by the President and the Senate of the <name type="place">United States</name>; and explained to them such parts as he had been advised they did not understand requesting them to ask or propound any question growing out of the Treaty that might facilitate its <orig reg="elucidation">illucidation</orig>, hoping (he added) that none would leave this place without an expression of their minds upon any clause or article of the Treaty they did not clearly understand; as it would give him the greatest pleasure to remove any <orig reg="obstacles">obsticles</orig> that lay in the way of a plain and correct understanding of the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>Amongst others of less importance <name type="person">Walter Adair</name> (one of the natives) propounded the follow questions (to wit) 1st are any persons or person entitled by the Treaty to reservation Except the head of an Indian Family. 2ndly  If a person who has taken a reservation removes to any other part of the Old Nation<pb n="[9]"/>will the land reserved revert to the <name type="place">United States</name> in the same manner as if he were to remove to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name>.  3rdly with whom will persons taking reservations be Enumerated with those who remain in the Old Nation or those who remove to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name>. (These questions grew out of the 3rd and eighth Articles of the Treaty)
                  </p>
                  <p>To which <orig reg="interrogatories">interogatories</orig> his Excellency made the following answers  To the 1st he ans<gap reason="document damaged" desc="wer">ed negatively, that none were entitled to take reservation under the treaty but the heads of Indian families.  The second question he answered in the affirmative that a removal from the land reserved would be by the terms of the Treaty an abandonment of <gap reason="document damaged"> To the third question he answered, that he conceived those taking reservations ought not to be Enumera<gap reason="document damaged" desc="ted"> with either, as it is upon the express condition <del type="overstrike">of becoming of</del> becoming Citizens that they are authorized to take reservations; and of course <orig reg="cannot">can not</orig> belong to the <name type="place">Ark<gap reason="document damaged" desc="an">sas</gap>
                              </name> or the Old Nation; whence then the reason for Enumerating them with either.  And <orig reg="suppose">supose</orig> there are of<pb n="[10]"/>the Old Nation 5000 who wish to remain East of the <name type="place" reg="River">Mississippi</name> and 5000 of the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> and 440 persons who have taken reservations.  Place these reserves on part of the <name type="place">Arkansas</name>, and when the division of the land takes place you will be leasing the quantity of land allowed to those reserves more than is right out of the Old Nation.  On the other hand suppose them added to the Old Nation to be Enumerated: you  will be taking from the <name type="place">United States</name> a like quantity of Land, which in my opinion <add place="supralinear">(he added)</add> would be extremely unjust in either case and contrary to what ever was contemplated by the Treaty.  Therefore taking it upon every ground upon which it could be placed, he was of Opinion that they ought not to be Enumerated with either.
