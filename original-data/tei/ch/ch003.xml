               <note type="summary">This document is a letter from Evan Jones, a Baptist missionary at the Valley Towns (North Carolina) of the Cherokee Nation, to James Barbour, Secretary of War (1825-1828), dated November 15, 1826.  Jones communicates information to Barbour relative to the progress of various industries in the Cherokee Nation,  most notably the establishment of several mills.  The improvements have been made under the direction of the Board of managers of the Baptist General Convention and also include a well attended school.  Jones also remarks on the general "progress" of the Cherokees with respect to Christianity and the "civilized arts."</note>

               <p>I have the <orig reg="honor">honour</orig> to submit to your inspection a report of mills and other Buildings erected at this station from the year <date value="1822-00-00">1822</date> to the present time.</p>
               <p>These improvements have been made under the direction of the Board of managers of the Baptist General convention and the utmost <orig reg="Economy">Econemy</orig> has been uniformly observed in carrying them on.</p>
               <p>The Erection of the mills, which are now just finished became <orig reg="necessary">nessesary</orig> in consequence of the former ones, situated on cabin creek 5 miles from the Mission house, being completely destroyed, by a <orig reg="tremendous">tremendious</orig> Freshet on the night of the <date value="0000-02-20">20th of February</date> last, which rendered our situation <add place="supralinear">with regard to provisions</add> very distressing: there being no mill that could supply the Establishment, within a distance of fifty miles. The present mills are situated on the River <name type="place" reg="River">Hiwasee</name>. The works are all good and substantial, Both Mills are in operation and perform well. They will be a most valuable acquisition to this <orig reg="neighborhood">neighbourhood</orig> and will greatly facilitate the progress which is making in Buildings, agriculture, and the civilized arts, though the state of the country as yet does not warrant the expectation of any profit from them.  All the items contained <add place="supralinear">in the</add> enclosed statement are finished , but a considerable portion of the  <orig reg="expense">expence</orig> is unpaid, on account of the funds of our Board being at present very depressed.</p>
               <p>The aid of Government would therefore be peculiarly Acceptable at this time and I feel persuaded that the funds thus applied will very powerfully promote the cause of humanity which has been espoused by the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Govt. and so zealously prosecuted by the Executive.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, I beg leave to observe that in this vicinity which has always been deemed the darkest part of the Nation<pb n="[2]"/> Agriculture, Female industry, general knowledge, good order and decency of appearance are making very sensible progress, And our holy religion has produced in some of the natives that happy change which no human efforts can <orig reg="possibly">posibly</orig> effect!  Our school has been very well <orig reg="attended">attend</orig> the past year and many of our pupils have made very pleasing improvements.  Several who have left the school have become respectable and useful members of society, among their people   Thus under the benign <orig reg="influence">influance</orig> of our happy Government and the prudent management of its principal organs   Ignorance and confusion and wretchedness are being chased from the abodes of man.
               </p>
