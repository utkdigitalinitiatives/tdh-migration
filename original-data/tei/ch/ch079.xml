Wool at the army headquarters in New Echota, Georgia (the capital of the Cherokee Nation), dated November 22, 1836.  Wool transmits twelve regulations governing the distribution of rations among the Cherokees.  The amount of rations delivered is to be based on the age of the recipient, and close account is to be kept.  In addition, Wool orders that any Cherokee suspected of intemperance shall receive no issues.</note>
