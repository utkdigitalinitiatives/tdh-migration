               <p>The <name type="person">Cherokees</name> are informed that the Superintendent of their removal West, will have Suitable Steam Boats ready for their transportation at the Agency on the <date value="0000-02-05">5th day of <abbr expan="February" type="contraction">Feby</abbr>
                  </date>, capable of taking One Thousand persons at a time, with comfort and Safety to their new homes, in fifteen days.  The removal by land with unavoidable exposure and fatigue will require at least Seventy days; the choice of way is, however, given to the emigrant.  The places of Rendezvous will be <del type="overstrike">
                     <unclear/>
                  </del> the Agency, <name type="place">Ross' Landing</name> and a point opposite <name type="place">Bellefonte</name>, at each of which places the Boats will stop to take in Emigrants.</p>
               <p>The Superintendent takes this occasion to repeat that he has been instructed by their great Father the President to treat the <name type="person">Cherokees</name> with kindness and friendship, and to assure them that to linger in the midst of a white population, suffering oppression and encroachment, ruin and extermination must inevitably fall on them.  In tenderness then to their persons and interests, he would urge them in the most friendly manner, assuring them at the same time that the Treaty will not be altered, to make speedy preparation, settle their business with the Commissioners, and remove before the <date value="0000-05-23">23rd. of May</date>, when the time arrives for the application of Military Force.</p>
