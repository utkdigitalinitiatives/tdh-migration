               <note type="summary">This document is a letter from Archibald Roane, Governor of Tennessee (1801-1803), to Colonel Return J. Meigs, U.S. agent to the Cherokees at Southwest Point in Tennessee, dated April 30, 1802.  Roane reports that  two white men killed a Creek Indian in Jackson County (Tennessee) and the nearby inhabitants fear reprisal from the Indians.  He also advises Meigs to warn the Indians in his area not to hunt near Jackson County, as the local inhabitants are  alarmed.  Roane assures Meigs he will conduct an inquiry into the murder and seek punishment for the perpetrators.  Another letter from Roane on this topic also appears in the Southeastern Native American Documents Database as <xref>ch017</xref>.</note>

                  <salute>Dear Sir, </salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I have lately heard the disagreeable news that on the <date value="1802-04-21">21st of this month</date> a <name type="person">Creek</name> Indian was killed in <name type="place">Jackson County</name> not far from <name type="person">Mr. Blackburn</name>'s by two men of the names <name type="person">Richmond</name> and <name type="person">Erwin</name>.  I have not been yet able to get the information, with sufficient accuracy to determine what steps it will be necessary to pursue to bring the offenders to punishment if the Act should on examination be deserving of punishment.  My present impressions are that it was a very  unwarrantable Act, perhaps such an one for which the offenders ought to atone with their lives.<pb n="[2]"/>The Inhabitants near that place I understand are considerably alarmed and have collected, (a few families together), for greater safety apprehending that immediate retaliation is intended.  My Information is further, that <name type="person">Major Russell</name> has collected a party and gone to the mountain in search of some camps of Indians, If he should meet with them I dread the consequences.
               </p>
               <p>I think it would be prudent for the Indians to avoid going near that place in their hunting excursions until the present alarm subsides, as any man under apprehension of danger may be induced to do an Act for which he would afterward have cause to repent.  If you have received accurate information<pb n="[3]"/>on this subject please for make a statement of it to me.
               </p>
               <p>You may be assured I will do every thing in my power, consistent with Law to have an impartial enquiry into the nature of the  transaction, and the punishment of the offenders if they should be found to merit it.</p>
