               <p>The <name type="person">Cherokees</name> are among the bravest and noblest of the <name type="person">American</name> race.  This nation has long been distinguished for being in advance of the other Indian tribes in the arts of civilization. Some of their chieftains have been really great men, fully sensible of the disadvantages of their condition, and sagacious in devising a means to remedy them. Among these chieftains, the late <name type="person">Charles Hicks</name>, and <name type="person">John Ross</name>, now at the head of the nation, were preeminent. Under their directing councils, and aided by the policy of the general government, they have outstripped all the other tribes in the march of improvement.</p>
               <p>The natives carry on considerable trade with the adjoining states, and some of <orig reg="them">they</orig> carry their cotton down the <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, and even down the <name type="place" reg="River">Mississippi</name> to <name type="place">New Orleans</name>.  Apple and peach orchards are very common, and much attention is paid to gardens in the nation. There are many public roads in the nation and houses of entertainment kept by the natives.</p>
               <p>Numerous /<add place="superlinear"/> flourishing villages are to be seen in every section of the country. Cotton and woolen cloths and blankets are manufactured here. Almost every family raise<gap desc="s" reason="edge of document"> cotton for its own consumption. Industry and commercial enterprise <del type="overstrike">have</del>

               <p>Different <orig reg="mechanical">machanical</orig> trades are pursued. The population is rapidly increasing, and the female character is much respected.</p>
               <p>Their number is about 14000.</p>
