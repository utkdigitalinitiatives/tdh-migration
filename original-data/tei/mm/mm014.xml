               <note type="summary ">This is a photograph of a map of the Overhill
				Cherokee sites that were occupied during the 18th century. The map is based on
				Henry Timberlake's 1762 map of the area as well as archaeological
				investigations made in 1967 through 1982, by The University of Tennessee as
				part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of
				the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations
				were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). These well- known Overhill settlements of Mialoquo,
				Tuskeegee, Toqua, Chota, Citico, Tallassee, and Chilhowee are now all under
				water. The Cherokees who were located in north Georgia, northwest South
				Carolina, and Western North Carolina had to travel over the mountains from
				South Carolina to reach their brethren who lived in the lower Tennessee and
				Hiawasee River Valleys and thus they were referred to as the Overhill
				Cherokees. </note>
