               <note type="summary ">This is a drawing of posthole patterns dating
				back to the mid-18th century of a winter townhouse (top) and summer pavilion
				(below) from the Overhill Cherokee town of Tomotley. All political and social
				events were held in these townhouses. The winter townhouse was a large conical
				structure, which contained amphitheater seating around a central hearth. The
				rectangular summer town or council house was an open pavilion suitable for warm
				weather. Excavations of Tomotley were conducted by the University of Tennessee
				in 1976 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the
				flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and
				the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe.
				Field Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</note>
