				recover archaeological artifacts from 18th century Overhill Cherokee villages
				in East Tennessee. Excavations were conducted by the University of Tennessee
				from 1967-1982 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of
				the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River Valley by the Tellico Dam
				Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park
				Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).</note>
