               <note type="summary">This is a computer generated topographic site
				map of the Chattooga site indicating the location of archaeological structures.
				Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee
				Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village associated with the Lower town
				Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site
				is thought to have been occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the
				Cherokees in the 1740s. This site is given special attention because it
				retained early 18th century Cherokee material culture. This material culture is
				difficult to find and distinguish on other Cherokee sites of the same time
				period. The University of Tennessee (UT) and the Francis Marion National Forest
				conducted archaeological excavations at Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus
				of these excavations was to develop a better understanding of the nature of the
				historical Cherokee occupation at the site and compare these findings with
				those found on other 18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these
				excavations, archaeologists were able to identify and partially excavate the
				remains of five superimposed council houses. In addition, the excavations of
				two winter structures and one summer domestic structure were conducted. Through
				the use of surface collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing
				equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the location of additional buildings
				and features were found with minimal disturbance to the site. The excavation of
				Chattooga is still an active research project with additional findings in the
				process of being documented.</note>
