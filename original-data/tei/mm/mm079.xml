               <note type="summary"> This is a photograph of the post hole pattern
				of an excavated townhouse at Chattooga. Townhouses were usually found in
				villages with a population of more than 350 people and was the most prominent
				building in the villages. Townhouses were where most of the social, ceremonial,
				and political activities took place in the village. Chattooga is a Cherokee
				archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was
				an 18th century village associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of
				northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been
				occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s.
				This site is given special attention because it retained early 18th century
				Cherokee material culture. This material culture is difficult to find and
				distinguish on other Cherokee sites of the same time period. The University of
				Tennessee (UT) and the Francis Marion National Forest conducted archaeological
				excavations at Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus of these excavations was
				to develop a better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee
				occupation at the site and compare these findings with those found on other
				18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists
				were able to identify and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed
				council houses. In addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one
				summer domestic structure were conducted. Through the use of surface
				collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of
				artifacts and the location of additional buildings and features were found with
				minimal disturbance to the site. The excavation of Chattooga is still an active
				research project with additional findings in the process of being
				documented.</note>
