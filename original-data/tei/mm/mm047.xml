               <note type="summary ">This is a diagram of the Tellico Blockhouse
				excavations. The Tellico Blockhouse was constructed in 1794-95 adjacent to the
				earlier Fort Loudoun at the confluence of the Tellico and Little Tennessee
				Rivers in what is presently Monroe County as a federal outpost. In 1805 federal
				officials and Overhill Cherokees negotiated a treaty at the Tellico Blockhouse
				which moved the federal agency south to the mouth of the Hiawassee. By 1807 the
				federal government abandoned Tellico and moved the rest of its agency to the
				Hiawassee River post, the new center of the Overhill Cherokee settlement.
				Excavations of the Tellico Blockhouse were conducted by the University of
				Tennessee from 1972-1974 in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little
				Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. Excavations of the Blockhouse
				were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field
				Director, Richard R. Polhemus.</note>
