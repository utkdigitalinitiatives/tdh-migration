				Brahm's map detail of the area of the Little Tennessee River Valley containing
				the Overhill Cherokee village of Tomotley. De Brahm spent time in Tomotley as
				the guest of Chief Ostenaco in 1756 and contributed to the design and building
				of Fort Loudoun, 1756-1759. In 1773 DeBrahm completed his "Report of the
				General Survey in the Southern District of North America" which includes
				information he gathered about the Cherokees while he lived among them.</note>
