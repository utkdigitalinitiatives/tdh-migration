               <note type="summary ">This is a photograph of mid-18th century Kaolin
				smoking pipes recovered from Chota. The Overhill Cherokees traded actively with
				the lower Cherokees of Georgia and South Carolina. Chota was recognized by
				Europeans as well as other Indians for its powerful economic influence and was
				regarded as the capital of the Cherokee nation. The University of Tennessee
				conducted excavations of Chota from 1969-1974 in anticipation of the flooding
				of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				university worked under contract with the National Park Service and the
				Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe.
				Field Directors, J. Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F. Schroedl.</note>
