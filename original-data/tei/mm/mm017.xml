               <note type="summary ">This is a photograph of posthole patterns
				dating back to the mid-18th century of two Cherokee townhouses found in
				Tomotley. The rectangular summer pavillion is on the left and the larger
				circular winter townhouse or council house is on the right. In these public
				buildings, social, political, and military meetings were held. Excavations of
				Tomotley were conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1976 as part of the
				Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower
				Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were
				conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field
				Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</note>
