               <note type="summary"> This is a drawing of an Overhill Cherokee
				winter townhouse at Chota. Winter townhouses which were cone-shaped appeared to
				look like small mountains from a distance. Some were large enough to hold 500
				people. The seats were arranged like an amphitheater with the seats rising one
				above another, leaving an area in the center for a fire. The drawing is based
				on historical descriptions as well as archaeological excavations conducted by
				The University of Tennessee from 1969-1974. The excavations were conducted in
				anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico
				Dam Reservoir under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field
				Directors, J. Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F. Schroedl. The drawing
				is by Thomas Whyte.</note>
