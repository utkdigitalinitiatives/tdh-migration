               <note type="summary ">This is a photograph of a small pit used to
				smudge Cherokee ceramic vessels. It is from the 18th century Overhill Cherokee
				village of Chota in what is today Monroe County. Chota was recognized by
				Europeans as well as other Indians for its powerful socio-economic influence
				and was regarded as the capital of the Cherokee nation. Excavations of Chota
				and other Overhill villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee
				between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in
				anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico
				Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National
				Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator,
				Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J. Worth Greene.</note>
