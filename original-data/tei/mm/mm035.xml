               <note type="summary ">This aerial photograph shows the former site of
				Chota and Tanasee, 18th century Overhill Cherokee villages in the Little
				Tennessee River Valley. Chota was recognized by Native Americans and European
				settlers as a powerful social and economic influence and was regarded as the
				capital of the Cherokee nation. The University of Tennessee conducted
				excavations of Overhill Cherokee villages between 1967 and 1983 as part of the
				Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the lower
				Little Tennessee River Valley by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations
				were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA).</note>
