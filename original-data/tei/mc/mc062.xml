The times here, in fact, are unusually dull and lifeless._ I expected very sanguinely to see brother Lewis this evening in company with Franklin_ had I known that he intended to defer coming up <orig reg="until">untill</orig> the 8th or 10th of January; as badly prepared as I am for <orig reg="losing">loasing</orig> time I should have gone home some time since.  Inform him that severals up here have been expecting him some time and when he comes to be prepared to stay a day or so._ Say to mother, for me, that her Christmas gift came to hand; and cannot but be prized very highly by me,_ as <orig reg="coming">comeing</orig> from home <unclear>&amp;</unclear> and more especially from any mother_ I think the cake will not fail to fatten me. </p><p>I have heard of no one wanting to hire Ham yet.  As to the price of clover seed you have or will hear more from Frederick than I can inform you_ provided always that there is no great secret about it; and farther if it should not give a clue to his plans and <pb n="[2]"/> future operations._ The pork offered to this market this winter has been nearly or quite double in quantity to that of any previous year.</p><p>Have you any shelters <del type="overstrike">of</del> for the Durham stock; if not they will fare badly to night?  Are they in a thrifty condition?  There is now and has been during a week or two past a lot of the Durham stock in town. They were brought here by <name>Mr. Daugherty</name>  from <name>Kentucky</name>. _ If I do not speak <orig reg="publicly">publickly</orig>, I would say there is very little of the genuine stock in his lot of some 20 or 25._ For some he asks 3 and 4 hundred dollars; but they are greatly inferior to any one of yours.  Some he has sold for 2 and 3 hundred dollars already I do not believe, in fact, I know, I would not give your four for the whole lot._ On yesterday I saw <name>Mr. Heiskel</name>'s Bull for which he gave one thousand dollars._ His is a very fine animal._ But in my opinion he is not superior in any respect to Hanibal_ he is larger it is true; but Hanibal if treated as he should be will be as large or large and I think he <orig reg="excels">excells</orig> Heiskel's in one or two very important parts.  You should have him curried regularly and if you would have the hair on his head and neck kept <orig reg="straight">strait</orig> and smooth it would make a wonderful difference in his countenance. Lewis will infer from this that I have caught the Durham fever.</p><p>Give my respects to all.</p><closer><signed><name>James <abbr expan="Monroe">M.</abbr> Welcker</name></signed> <pb n="[3]"/> <address><addrLine><name>Charles <abbr expan="Frederick">F</abbr> Welcker</name> <abbr expan="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></addrLine><addrLine><name>Laurel Banks</name></addrLine><addrLine><name>Roane County</name></addrLine></address></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
