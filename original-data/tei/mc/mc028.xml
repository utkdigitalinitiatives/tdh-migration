If he does not, I cannot but believe that Wallace will wait until the meeting of the November Court (I mean the Bankrupt Court) by which time I think I shall have made &amp; received money enough to pay the balance of the debt&mdash; I think I cannot be mistaken in the calculation that I shall make $1000.&mdash; by November&mdash; and the profits of my office will not stop there for I have heard of a good many others who are filing their petitions, and the times I believe will not improve &amp; if not, they must make a great many Bankrupts. <pb n="[2]"/> I am now very much in the notion of quitting the tavern keeping if we could do so&mdash; But there are two great difficulties in the way of our doing so&mdash; <name type="person">Humes</name> &amp; <abbr expan="company">co</abbr> would not let us off, &amp; it would be a hard matter to find any body who would take it off our hands; besides what better business could we engage in? I might possibly do well at the law, but it would be uncertain; <abbr expan="although">altho'</abbr> my friends all advise me to resume the <orig reg="practice">practise</orig> of the law and I have it in contemplation to do so.</p><p>But I must give you a little of my history lately&mdash; I went from <name type="place">Greeneville</name> to <name type="person">Allen Gillespie's</name>&mdash;was very kindly treated&mdash; the old man is very low with <orig reg="Diabetes">Diabetis</orig>, and it is generally believed he can never recover&mdash; but he seemed to think he would be well in a month or two. he did not swear any whilst I was there, and it appears very strange <del type="overstrike">for</del> to hear him talk and not to swear&mdash; his <name type="person">Patsy,</name> has married a very clever man I am told&mdash; He has a daughter just grown <name>Sarah</name> who is tolerable pretty, she had a beau when I was there, a brother of <name type="person">Brownlows'</name>&mdash; I <orig reg="stopped">stoped </orig> at <name type="person">Chesters'</name> tavern &amp; was <orig reg="shown">shewn</orig> into my old room, and well attended to&mdash;spent the greater part of one day in attending to the Bankrupts in <name type="person">Jonesboro</name>&mdash;had a long talk with Brownlow, &amp; was very much entertained by him&mdash; met <name type="person">Mary Taylor, </name>who is going to the Academy there&mdash;the academy is in a very prosperous&mdash; condition &mdash; The night I left Jonesboro' I stayed all night with <name type="person">Dr. Humphrey</name> who used to be in partnership with<name type="person"> Landon Carter</name>&mdash; He has applied to become a Bankrupt and was very polite&mdash; indeed the Bankrupts are all polite&mdash; the next night at <name>Hodges</name> on <name type="place">Watauga,</name> &amp; the next day after travelling over a very mountainous region, I <orig reg="reached">reachd</orig> your <name type="person">Aunt Mary's</name> late in the Afternoon, found her and <name type="person">Nat</name> at home she has got the dining room &amp; kitchen part of her old house finished, &amp; very well done too&mdash; she occupies the dining room as her bedroom &amp; <add place="supralinear">has</add> beds in the kitchen for company her kitchen at present is in the Cellar&mdash; she seems to be very comfortable <pb n="[3]"/> Next day&mdash; by <name type="person">Alfred Taylors</name> to <name type="person">L.
