King writes the letter from Memphis, Tennessee, where yellow fever has killed many of its residents and has caused others to flee the city.  King writes of  his good health and of hers, certain business matters involving himself, and states that the fever will soon be gone so that Mrs. King can return home. King speaks of many of their friends in the city that have become ill, or were ill due to the fever. He concludes by wishing her and their family continued health and a prompt reunion.</note><note type="collection">James King Papers</note><note type="box">MS-14, b1</note><note type="folder">1830-1839</note><note type="document">mc012</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Yellow Fever</item><item>Letters</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Memphis</name></addrLine><addrLine>Sunday <date value="1835-10-21"><abbr expan="October">Oct.</abbr> 21st 1835.</date></addrLine></address><salute><hi>My Dear little wife</hi></salute></opener><p>I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> your letter of the <date value="0000-00-17">17th</date>, also the enclosed certificate of <name type="person">Mr Hull</name>. I am glad to hear daily by telegraph that you are well and trust you will continue so. I am as usual in good health notwithstanding there is so much <gap reason="hole in document"/> throughout Memphis. The fever has taken <gap reason="hole in document"/> many, and in some families not a single member has been left. None of your particular acquaintances have died that I remember of. The number of deaths last week and the week before are the same though there has been a considerable abatement in the disease in the last 3 days. The indications are that in a very short time the fever will entirely disappear and the many Citizens that fled will soon return. <name type="person">Mr. Montomery</name> left yesterday for <name type="person">Huntsville</name> to close our business there if possible. At least it will be his last trip upon that business &amp; will determine whether we will construct the Huntsville line or not. <pb n="[2]"/> He will be absent about a week &mdash; Upon his return I am almost satisfied the city will be healthy enough to bring you home. <name type="person">Mrs. Jiggetts</name> has recovered. <name type="person">Mrs Williamson</name> is in delicate health &mdash; have not seen her out of her room since I returned. <name type="person">Mrs Dill</name> as usual, the rest well &mdash; <name type="person">D. Watson</name> is trying to get a room at <name type="person">Mrs Rutherfords</name> for his family. They will have to take a room in the 3rd story or the one we occupied, as Mrs. <abbr expan="Williamson">W.</abbr> will continue in hers. I will send the silk for <name type="person">Mary Ann</name>, the first opportunity that offers. I am glad to hear you are <orig reg="relieved">releived</orig> of your troublesome birth, that it is all over now. Take good care of the rest as you have good reason to value and be proud of them. Mr. <gap reason="hole in document"/> stay here was very short.

I have no news to write you. the city is dull, but will soon be shining again &mdash; Good bye. Tell Mary Pa wants to see her so bad. &amp; Ma &amp; baby and all. My love to all.
