Great interest and excitement is manifested by almost every person in the election. <name type="person">Mr. Foster</name>, is engaged every moment of his time in electioneering, and requested me to write to you. He says that <name type="person">McFarland</name> he thinks will vote for him, but he fears that <name type="person">Mr. Fain</name> &amp; <name type="person"><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo.</abbr> Brazelton</name> will make him (Mc F.) render a rigid account to his constituents for his vote. Mr Foster says that you can do something with Mr. Fain &amp; <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo.</abbr> Brazelton, to relieve Mr. McFarland from this embarrassment; I have written a short letter, to Mr. Fain, but you will see him, and can talk to him upon the subject. I find that the papers you sent to Mr. F. have been filed in the Secretary's office, but <name type="person">McGraw</name> has neglected to send the papers, which he promised to do. The secretary says that I can file them at my leisure. I will write to <abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> McGraw immediately, &amp; request him to forward the <add place="supralinear">necessary</add> papers without delay.</p><pb n="[2]"/><p>I have not said much yet about the claim of  <name type="person">Carters</name> heirs, but <name type="person">D.

He is I am told boarding at <name type="person">Grundy's</name> son in law's house ( <name type="person">I McGavock</name>);  and electioneers hard for Grundy.
