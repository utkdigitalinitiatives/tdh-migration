Father was up there a few weeks since and he says if you do not sell it soon there will be nothing to sell as it looks like a few more high waters would carry it away.  Cook does not saw any for people he did not even saw the stocks that Nail delivered <orig reg="there">ther</orig>. he said that they were not worth sawing and so they laid there until the high water Came and carried the most of them away</p><p>Cook has got the rent corn <orig reg="hauled">halled</orig> he thinks that there is 300 bushels but Father says that there is not more than half so much if that. I suppose Henry told you that <name>Major Burris</name> and <name>Monroe</name> were buying hogs. Father will have about 3000 weight of bacon to sell and he says if you can give him 10 cents per pound that he will send it to you by some of the <unclear><orig reg="boatsmen">botsmen</orig></unclear> the <orig reg="meat">meet</orig> is small <pb n="[2]"/>  the hogs weighing from 100 to 150 each if you take the bacon you must write immediately and let Father know where it is to be delivered at and he is obliged to have the money early next fall so that he can make another trip to <name>kentucky</name>   as Monroe made a very bad <orig reg="bargain">bargin</orig> this fall Mr Burris will take all of his bacon down the river early next <orig reg="February">Febuary</orig> and Father says that he would advise you to come immediately and try to sell the mill and if you can not sell it to put it in better hands for Cook <orig reg="does">dos</orig> nothing but live on the <unclear>tole</unclear> and if you are here when Burris starts you can probably have a better chance than at an other time of carrying the bacon down and indeed I know of no other way to do as Father is <orig reg="hardly">harly</orig> able to manage his own business and he has no help  for Monroe is at school in <name>Knoxville</name> he started last Month and it is likely he will go <unclear>3</unclear> sessions we received a letter from Frederick a few days since he was well and at that time in <name>Asheville <abbr expan="North Carolina">N.C.</abbr></name> we also got one from Lewis last evening- he was in good health he says that he has <pb n="[3]"/> written to you and received no answer he wants you to write to him and let him know where to direct his letter so that you can get <orig reg="them">then</orig> for he said that he expected that you had not got them or you <orig reg="surely">shurely</orig> would have written to him.  we have not heard from Henry since he wrote to us while in <name>Taladego</name>.</p><p>we intended to have sent this by <name>Mr Nail</name> but he has just sold his boat to <name>Mr Blain</name> a son in law to <name><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Gillespie</name> he gave $2 per foot and has just left here to go to the mill to get it Father again insists that you should come immediately.</p><p>the family are all well and send <orig reg="their">there</orig> love to you and please receive a large portion from your sister</p><closer><signed><name>Catharine F Welcker</name> </signed> <address><addrLine>to <name>Charles F Welcker</name></addrLine></address></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
