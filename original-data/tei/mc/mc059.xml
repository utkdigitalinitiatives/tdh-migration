Lenoir to his brother-in-law Charles F. Welcker in Roane County, Tennessee.  Lenoir writes to inform Welcker that Ellick, a slave he had hired from Welcker was found to have left his clothes behind in a hollow log as he had seemingly departed from Lenoir's property.  Lenoir states that he wishes to flog Ellick, but asks Welcker his opinion on the matter.</note><note type="collection">Welcker Papers</note><note type="box">MS-12, b3</note><note type="folder">1839</note><note type="document">mc059</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Slaveholders</item><item>Tennessee, East</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/> <opener><address><addrLine>Mouth of <name>Sweet Water</name></addrLine><addrLine><date>July 7th 1839</date></addrLine></address> <salute>Dear Charles</salute></opener><p><name>Goin</name> arrived safe last evening, and I have taken the liberty of sending him back to acquaint you with some circumstances of late occurrence, in regard to which I am at a loss how to proceed.</p><p>Yesterday evening some fishermen found a wallet hid in a hollow log about two hundred yards up the creek which they examined and found to contain mens clothes_ <orig reg="they">the</orig> let me know it &amp; I found them to be Ellick's_ brought them to the house privately &amp; have them in keeping but for which I think he would have been off last night.
