I have for a long time &caret;<add place="supralinear">believed</add> that immediately after some anticipated occurrence, just <unclear>before</unclear> us, we should be discharged and permitted to return home &mdash; In all this I have been disappointed until now I have concluded that <orig reg="though">tho'</orig> possibly we may soon return home from this place, yet probably we shall be retained in the service until the end of our term.  I was very much disappointed in finding the <name type="person">Mexicans</name>  prepared to make a stand in the mountains at Sierra Gorda, for I thought we should have no more fighting. &mdash; I had 24 men mounted besides <name type="person"><abbr expan="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> Bell</name> &amp; myself at the time the army marched from <name type="place">Vera Cruz</name> , they were the only horses of our Regiment which had arrived &mdash; We &caret;<add place="supralinear">alone of our Regiment</add> marched with the army, and were in the battle &mdash; And from the time we left Very Cruz up to our arrival here a few days since I was put upon constant duty with my few men. &mdash; Conveying <orig reg="dispatches">despatches</orig> to <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> &mdash;

tours of survey</add> &mdash; which was a hazardous service, for on one of there excursions 18 of us were attacked by a party of Ranchero's some 30 or 40 I think (<abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> <del type="overstrike">the</del> a company of Dragoons and a company of Infantry who had a skirmish with the same party on the day afterwards report them to have numbered 2 or 300&mdash;) We charged and  ran them into the <orig reg="chaparral">chaperal</orig> &mdash;

ready to dash upon the enemy whenever the storming party should have obtained possession of the enemy breast works, they were however repulsed as you will see reported &mdash; With my men I was exposed to the fire of <del type="overstrike">the</del> cannon and musketry, but all escaped unhurt &mdash; I shall tire you many times hereafter with the particulars of all I have seen &amp; heard on this campaign, and this is my excuse for not writing more at large in my letter &mdash; Indeed I feel like writing about nothing but returning home, &mdash; And now let me tell you your prospects in that great end of the campaign to which I look with so much anxiety &mdash; <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> North</name> has gone forward to the Castle of <name type="place">Perote</name> , which is considered one of the enemy's strongest fortifications; and it was supposed that the enemy would fight us there if any where on the route to <name type="place">Mexico</name>&mdash; But instead of finding the enemy in force at Perote &mdash; <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> North found a Mexican officer there who had been sent to deliver up to him the castle (capable of garrisoning 10,000 troops) and with <pb n="[2]"/> the castle 50 pieces of artillery &mdash; Before  <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> North arrived at Perote, he had passed a position which the enemy had fortified, and armed with 15 cannon this position was abandoned, and the cannon spiked &mdash; By their not spiking their cannon at Perote and by their sending an officer to deliver up the place; it is thought by many <del type="overstrike">it is</del> <add place="supralinear">to be</add> an inkling of peace &mdash; Besides this it is said that we have now captured all the Cannon in Mexico, except six pieces &mdash; <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Taylor</name>  too is said to be on his way to the City of Mexico and as near, if not nearer than we are The Mexican<del type="overstrike">s</del> <add place="supralinear">Government</add> certainly has not the means of supporting an army &mdash; And all together it does seem that they are pretty well wound up &mdash; Yet there is no calculating upon such a perfidious people &mdash; who are governed as slaves, (and mostly in ten times worse conditions than our slaves)&mdash; by Officers, more false, more deceitful than they are &mdash; <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Scott &caret;<add place="supralinear">with his army</add> will go to the city of Mexico, whether we have peace or &caret;<add place="supralinear">a continuance of</add> war &mdash; If he is assured there is to be no other battle, he will discharge us immediately, otherwise we shall accompany him&mdash; The diligence left here on day before yesterday for the City of Mexico, we shall remain here some two weeks longer, and in the <orig reg="meantime">mean time</orig> <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Scott confidently expects to receive proposals for peace &mdash; perhaps by return of the diligence &mdash; This is the most delightful climate I was ever in, <del type="overstrike">al</del> a little too cool by night, to <del type="overstrike">us</del> <add place="supralinear">those</add> who sleep as I do &caret;<add place="supralinear">now</add> without any other bed or shelter except the grassy turf, the sky, and a good blanket &mdash;&mdash; We have good water too, cold as that of our own mountain springs&mdash; Jalapa is the finest city I have seen in Mexico I have looked around &caret;<add place="supralinear">a little</add> for something to get for you and <name type="person">Eliza</name> &mdash; but I have not seen <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig>, except such as I can get in <name type="place">Orleans</name>&caret;   <add place="supralinear">of better quality</add> and upon better terms than here &mdash; Give my love to Eliza&mdash; to your Ma and all the family &mdash; It is probable I shall not have another opportunity of writing to you again before I return &mdash; Unless I should be detained several days in Orleans, as perhaps I shall &mdash; in having my men paid off and discharged &mdash; if so I will write to you from that place &mdash; A short time past, I thought often with much pleasure &caret;<add place="supralinear">as I do occasionally yet</add> of many things (flowers, articles of dress, and <add place="supralinear">indeed of</add> every pretty thing I saw, with a wish to bring it home with me for you, and have made memorandums of such things as I  could get for you in Orleans &mdash;
