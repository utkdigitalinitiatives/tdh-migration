               <note type="summary">This document is a communication from an unidentified source and is ostensibly directed to the Cherokees.  The document indicates that the President of the United States desires a post road to be permitted to run through part of the Cherokee Nation, the Creek Nation and the Choctaw Nation from Knoxville (Tennessee) to New Orleans (Louisiana).  The communication further reveals the President's request that the post riders be welcomed and entertained by the nations through which they travel.  Dated October 27, 1805.</note>
