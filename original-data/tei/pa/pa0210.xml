			 <note type="summary">This letter, from Secretary of War William Eustis to Colonel Elias Earle, discusses the desire of Colonel Earle to establish an Ironworks in the Cherokee Nation. Eustis asks Colonel Earle to select another piece of land for the possible establishment of the Ironworks because the previous tract of land has been designated, by treaty, as a site for the Cherokee chiefs and warriors. Eustis also tells Colonel Earle that Colonel Meigs has been instructed to help in this selection of new land.</note>
