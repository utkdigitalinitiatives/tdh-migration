               <p>My <orig reg="endeavor">endeavour</orig> to afford you some consolation and an alleviation and exemption from pain and affliction, I deem one of the most glorious achievements of my life.  Nothing could afford me more pleasing and durable satisfaction, than to know myself the author of so much good to thousands, as the publication of the following receipts must produce.  They were discovered, tried, and their use ascertained and sanctioned, by the lengthy and extensive practice of an Indian, who devoted his whole life to curing the diseases and aiding the indigent.  He <orig reg="labored">laboured</orig> from motives of pure humanity, possessing the most willing hand and feeling heart.  From the same motives, was it, that (unwilling his much experience should be lost to the world,) he placed these receipts in my hand.  When this first happened, elated with the prospect of success, in the acquisition of wealth and <orig reg="honor">honour</orig>, which I supposed they might infallibly secure to me, I determined to keep them from the eye of the world.  But thanks to the great Author of Nature, my heart of stone is converted into one of the most tender sensibility.  I now feel, that it is an obligation I owe my fellow mortals to contribute all in my power to their necessities and comforts; and as the hand of disease more completely than any thing else, deprives them of these, so by disclosing a method by which they may be lessened, both in danger and frequency, I shall most effectually fulfil my purpose.  The diseases for which these receipts were prescribed embrace most that are of common occurrence, especially of much importance and consequence.  They go from me with great delight; but still greater will be the delight if I should have the pleasure to<pb n="iv[4]"/>see them take a wide spread and have the happy effect that they have invariably had while given by my direction, or the direction of their good and virtuous author.  That this may be the case, I pray <hi rend="i">God grant</hi>.  May your lives be thereby prolonged and made happy.  May the blessing of Heaven be liberally showered upon you, and you be induced to bless and praise the Lord for his goodness and mercy in sending this man upon earth, and endowing him with a competence of skill, not yet surpassed.

                     <p>Take peppermint, spearmint and the seed of caraway, of the two first a handful, of the last half a handful; these should be steeped in a pint and a half of water, till the strength is out, then strained through a linen cloth; to this tea add a table spoonful of ginger, and drink it while a little warm and you will be sure to obtain relief.</p>
