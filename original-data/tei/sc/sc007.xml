               <note type="summary">This document is a hand drawn map of the battle
				that occurred at Horseshoe Bend on March 27th, 1814. Led by General Andrew
				Jackson, the United States regular army, the Tennessee militia, Cherokee and
				Lower Creek Indians fought against the Upper Creek Indians at Horseshoe Bend,
				in present day Alabama. Over eight hundred Upper Creeks were killed and over
				two hundred women and children were captured. This was the final battle of the
				Creek War of 1813-1814. The Creek Indians lost almost 20 million acres of land
				in Alabama and Georgia in a treaty with the United States. Andrew Jackson
				returned to Tennessee a hero and was later elected as President of the United
				States.</note>
