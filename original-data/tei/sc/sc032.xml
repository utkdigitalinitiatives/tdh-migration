			 <date value="1800-03-21">March 21st, 1800</date>; buried at 
			 <name type="place">Knoxville</name>. He was a member of the General
			 Assembly of North Carolina, 
			 <date value="1775-00-00">1775</date>- 
			 <date value="1776-00-00">6</date>; was a member of the first
			 Continental Congress, 
			 <date value="1783-00-00">1783</date>- 
			 <date value="1784-00-00">4</date>, and also of the last, 
			 <date value="1786-00-00">1786</date>- 
			 <date value="1787-00-00">7</date>, and was one of the signers of the
			 Constitution. 
			 <date value="1790-00-00">1790</date> he was appointed by 
			 <name type="person">President Washington</name>, Governor of
			 "Territory of the United States, South of 
			 <name type="place">the Ohio</name>"- now Tennessee. He set up his
			 government first in 
			 <name type="place">Sullivan County</name> at the house of 
			 <name type="person">William Cobb</name>, near the forks of the 
			 <name type="place">Holston and Watauga rivers</name>. This, however,
			 he soon changed to Knoxville, where he continued to reside until Tennessee
			 became a State. While Territorial Governor, Blount was also Superintendent of
			 Indian affairs in the South and West, and effected a number of important
			 treaties with the Indians, the most notable being, "The Treaty of the Holston."

			 <name type="person">William Cocke</name> as his colleague. 
			 <date value="1797-00-00">1797</date> Blount was expelled from the
			 Senate on the charge of attempting to incite a military movement on the part of
			 the southern Indians against 
			 <name type="person">Spanish</name> possessions in the 
			 <name type="place">Mississippi Valley</name>. The people of Tennessee
			 at once elected him to the State Senate and he was made speaker of that body in
			 vindication of his political course. Blount was one of the most popular men in
			 the annals of Tennessee. His mother's name was 
			 <name type="person">Barbara Gray</name>. His wife was 
			 <name type="person">Mary Grainger</name>.</p>
