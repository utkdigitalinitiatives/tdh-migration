               <p>Yours of the 
			 <date value="0000-00-14">14th</date> 
			 
                  <abbr expan="ultimo">ulto</abbr> was forwarded to this place from 
			 <name type="place">Flat Rock</name>, and I was very glad to get it. I
			 suppose when you wrote you did not think it would have to follow me about so;
			 but so it is. I have been for some time, a little like Noah's dove which found
			 no rest for the sole of its feet. Lately they have been talking of sending me
			 into 
			 <name type="place">Kentucky</name> not to be stationed there however;
			 but whether this is really to be or not, I am not able to tell as
			 yet.</p> 
		  
               <p>So you have become familiar with "dwelling in tents". Well I am not
			 surprised that you should like it better than lodging in the farm houses
			 generally for if they are like some that I have been in, among the 
			 <name type="place">Cumberland Mountains</name>, an encampment must be
			 far preferable. One night I <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> at a house which
			 had but a single room, one door and I believe no windows. It was quite a
			 chilly night and the openings between the logs and planks were so large, that
			 the air had very free circulation without being subjected to much change of
			 temperature. For supper we had coarse corn bread and butter with
			 buttermilk without any plates and not a remarkably clean table cloth.
			 However as I am not very hard to please about food this did not trouble me a
			 great deal on looking around at my companions, all of whom were to sleep
			 with me in the same room, I found that there were eleven of us in all, viz, the
			 man of the house, his wife and five children, <pb n="[2]"/> two young women who
			 had walked five miles barefooted to help plant corn, and a young man besides
			 myself. As there were but two beds visible, I began to wonder how they
			 would dispose of us. From some cause or other they told me to go to bed first;
			 so I obeyed and commenced undressing myself before the women; which was rather
			 an awkward predicament for me to be placed in, being unaccustomed to such
			 proceedings and as you probably know, rather a bashful young man, when with the
			 ladies. The young women appeared to be quite as modest as myself and
			 turned their backs towards me. After getting into bed, the young man who had
			 been at work all day in the field and did not appear to be very clean, was put
			 in with me, and we two had one bed to ourselves. For the young women they
			 spread another on the floor, and most of the rest huddled together in the
			 third. Our bedstead was too short for me to stretch myself upon it. This, the
			 cool air and their covering made me quite glad to take an early departure the
			 next morning.
               </p> 
		  
               <p>The above specimen, is by no means, a fair criterion to judge the
			 people in this part of the country by. Though mostly plain they frequently live
			 very comfortably and possess a good degree of intelligence. In this place, I
			 find the society, so far as I have had leisure to enjoy it quite agreeable. To
			 be sure they are not so fashionable as the 
			 <name type="person">New Yorkers</name> or 
			 <name type="person">Bostonians</name> in many respects, yet to me,
			 this is anything but an objection <del type="overstrike">to them</del>. In this
		  respect, I do not agree with all my companions, some of whom, call it a dull
		  and stupid place. When people show a disposition to be atten <pb n="[3]"/> tive to strangers and are really so, in proportion to their
		  opportunities. I think it is a hard case, if we cannot be pleased, and make
		  allowances for circumstances.
               </p> 
		  
               <p>Your cousin whom I mentioned in my last was named 
			 <name type="person">Forby</name>, or something like I think and had
			 been employed a short time previously in 
			 <name type="place">Bangor</name> with 
			 <name type="person">Bedden</name> and 
			 <name type="person">McGaffey</name>, contractors. I believe he is a
			 native of 
			 <name type="person">Maine</name> and has been at sea a good deal,
			 although apparently not much over 20 years of age. He was perhaps a little
			 taller than you are; but not quite so stout. We left him in 
			 <name type="place">Norfolk</name> from which place he said that he
			 intended to proceed to 
			 <name type="place">Fayetteville</name>.</p> 
		  
               <p>My duties so far have been to superintend the surveys in this state.
			 At present there are two parties under me, one towards Kentucky and the other
			 towards 
			 <name type="place">
                     <abbr expan="North">N.</abbr>
				Carolina</name>. We also have an office in this place. My brother
			 
			 <name type="person">Lewis</name>, whom I hear is rather unwell, 
			 <name type="person">Mr Bacet</name> and 
			 <name type="person">Mr Wyatt</name> are engaged in this state.
			 We expect to see the Major and 
			 <name type="person">
                     <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Williams
				</name>here shortly. </p> 
		  
               <p>There are two Presbyterian Churches in this place. They are very
			 similar to the Trinitarian Congregationalists of 
			 <name type="place">
                     <abbr expan="New">N.</abbr> England</name>. They
			 had an Episcopal Clergy <gap reason="hole in document" desc="men"> here for a
			 short time and tried to form a society; but did not succeed. I wish they had
			 one for the sake of several of our party, who don't seem to enjoy any other
			 form of worship.</gap>
               </p> 
		  
               <p>Remember me to 
			 <name type="person">Messrs. Lee and Bennett</name>. Tell the latter
			 if he has not gone to the north yet, that I wish him a great deal of happiness
			 in his intended change. Write soon </p>
