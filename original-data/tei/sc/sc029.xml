               <p>After spending a few days with my family, I left home on the

                  <unclear>ult</unclear> for 
			 <name type="place"> Mossy Creek</name>, which place I
			 <orig reg="reached">reachd</orig> on Saturday time enough to preach at 12

                  <del type="overstrike">at that

		  bounded on the South, by 
		  <name type="place">Bays Mountain</name> and on the North by poor
		  ridges.</p> 
		  
               <p>On the Sabbath I addressed the people on the great subject of my
			 agency  After I had closed, <unclear>Dr</unclear> 
			 
                  <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev</abbr> added some well timed remarks. We
			 obtained a pledge of $ 17.  collected some <orig reg="friends">frinds</orig>, and <orig reg="organized">organised</orig> the
			 Mossy Creek Bible Society. The <orig reg="friends">frinds</orig> collected were
			 left with the <unclear>Treasurer</unclear> until he could obtain more. I think
			 the Society will gradually increase and do much good. From that neighbourhood I
			 went to 
			 <name type="place">Beans Station</name>, <unclear>via</unclear>
			 Rutledge,  where I spent two days, preached on Saturday and Sabbath
			  I formed a small Bible Society containing <del type="overstrike">some</del> about fifty members, some fifteen of whom are
		  <orig reg="colored">coloured</orig> people, who take a <emph>deep</emph>
		  interest in the cause, paying $3.00 of what was collected. This Society is

                  <date value="0000-03-30">March 30.th</date> I went across the country
			 some twenty miles <add place="supralinear">near</add> to the Mouth of Chucky
			  at <unclear>Beth Carr M. ?. </unclear> There being held a

			 <add place="supralinear">there </add>formed the Beth Carr Bible Society,
			 <unclear>?</unclear>  collected for it $8.23. and obtained
			 <orig reg="additional">aditional</orig> pledges, most of which will be, if they

               <p>This Society is designed to supply with Bibles

			 work</hi> to perform; with <hi>small means.</hi> I have situated places for
			 these Small Societies where they could do much, as distributors "of other man's

			 <orig reg="Committees">Committies</orig>. My views on this subject have been
			 previously given with <unclear>??riess.</unclear>

               <p>Wednesday evening,

			 the subscribers <del type="overstrike">negle</del> refused or neglected 
		  as they <hi>have still done</hi>  to take them. Learning the state of

		  <orig reg="organized">organised</orig> a Bible Society  collected $42.00
		  and made arrangements to have the Bibles distributed  myself taking away
		  <hi>one hundred <del type="overstrike">Bibles</del>

		  <unclear>citizens</unclear> of a country. By this means I <orig reg="succeeded">seceeded</orig> in obtaining such assistance as I trust, will
		  ere long supply that mountain country with the word of God.</p> 
		  
               <p>Wednesday, 
			 <date value="0000-04-08">April 8th</date> I passed 20 miles down the

                     <add place="top right corner">3</add> friends from the country, who will

               <p>Monday 
			 <date value="0000-00-13">13th</date> I <hi>drove</hi> to

				<abbr expan="County">Co</abbr>
                  </name> and <hi>finished</hi> the

			 <abbr expan="collected">collecd</abbr> of the Treasurer $38.86
			  over what had been paid for carriage on the 3 boxes. The people in
			 that place are waking up to the subject, and before the close of the year, they
			 will probably dispose of nearly a thousand Bibles, and more than that number of
			 Testaments  increasing your funds some $500.00 </p> 
		  
               <p>From Blountville I went to

				<abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>
                  </name> taking with me an

               <p>From these parts I returned and passed through

               </p> 
		  
               <p>I have <hi>now</hi> closed my monthly <unclear>report</unclear> The
