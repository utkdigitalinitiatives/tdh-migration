May 20, 1775. In addition to these I have collected other evidence in confirmation of the same transaction_ And <add>have</add> also <add>obtained</add> the signatures of many of the signees to the Declaration_</p><p>An enthusiastic admirer of that lofty spirit of freedom &amp; Independence which glowed in the bosoms &amp; animated the deliberations of that Patriotic Convention I wish to rescue from comparative oblivion so <orig reg="brilliant">briliant</orig> an event in the early history of our Country. One method of affecting this is to arrange the principal resolutions of that convention in a condensed form to which will be affixed the names of the members_ The accompanying manuscript will best illustrate the plan I had conceived_ I would also prefer that the names of those whose signatures I have been able to obtain should appear <del type="overstrike">in their</del> as they usually subscribed them but as you suggested that our artists were unable to execute full similes, that part might be omitted. I have thought that Horaces <unclear>aese perenning</unclear> should be either prefixed or appended to the declaration. If an obelisk or any such figure were on the sheet these words might be placed on its base_ But the execution I leave chiefly to yourself _ But I wish you to spare no pains in making it worthy of the eventful transaction it is intended to perpetuate_</p><p>The vellum and satin I will furnish _ Let me first see a plan of the piece (on which I will give you my opinion) accompanied with any remarks you think proper about the number I should have struck_ the price <abbr expan="and et cetera">&amp;c</abbr>.</p>
