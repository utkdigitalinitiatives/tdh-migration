I am very glad to hear that <name>Major McClellan</name> have arrived, and hope his <unclear>disorders</unclear> will leave him now he has got home-  the major is promoted to the 16 Regiment of Infantry commanded by <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Pierce, and now on the lines, was raised in <name>Pensylvania</name>.  We have passed the bank bill, but it remains yet to be assented to by the President, It is not believed it will be <orig reg="useful">usefull</orig> to the government, it has been modeled <orig reg="intensely">intensly</orig> by the Minority.  additional Tax's is proposed to the secretary of Treasury. probably to makeup for the <orig reg="deficiency">deficency</orig> in the bank, which wont afford any relief to the fiscal measures of government.  I need not give you any news from <name>orleans</name> as you will hear from that place before we can.  it is thought that there either have or will be, a number of black troops introduced into the Southern States.</p><p>I fear we shall be much embarrassed respecting money to supply the army, and <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know in what way it can be guaranteed now <pb n="[2]"/> now the bank have so much failed, we before had calculated very much upon that institution, but the hope is wasted - It is supposed we must have <orig reg="reconvene">reconvine</orig> to Treasury notes, and it is to be feared that so much paper will soon become Much depreciated - I wish you to write <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr>. Sparks &amp; Rutha  to bring off their negroes &amp; property as quick as possible, and while they can pass in safety through  the Indian Country.  I shall be very uneasy about them till they arrive and shall fear much on their account.  I have observed what you say respecting my suit at <orig reg="Mobile">Moabile</orig>, and shall <unclear>send</unclear> on by this mail a power to Willson making him my <orig reg="attorney">attorny</orig> in fact.  Shall also write <name>General Gains</name> to have an <unclear>eye</unclear> to the business, and wish you also to do the same.  I dont apprehend there is any danger of your Regiment being transferred, as to the <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> that wants to be at the head of it, I cant believe any thing like that of a gentleman - the secretary at war have been dangerously ill, and yet very much indisposed, so that no sickness can be <unclear>transmited</unclear> in that department.  I shall use all possible means to do something to settle that business with Kings <orig reg="execution">executon</orig> -  I wish <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr>. Rheaculan make some sales - He wrote me some time ago he had made some, to the amount of four or five hundred dollars, and expected to make more If you <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> come on until first of april, I suppose I shall not have an opportunity of <orig reg="getting">geting</orig> my <orig reg="mare">mair</orig> - I am still enjoying good health, but closely surrounded with sickness - </p> <closer><abbr expan="Your">Yr</abbr> affectionate father My affectionate regards to all our friends <signed>John Sevier</signed> <add><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo </abbr>Sevier</add> <pb n="[3]"/> <add>P.S.
