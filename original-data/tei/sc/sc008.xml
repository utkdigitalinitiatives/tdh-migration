               <note type="summary">This document consists of two letters, one from
				J.L. Edwards to Andrew Johnson, and one from Andrew Johnson to Mr. Blackston
				McDannel. The first letter, dated December 14, 1844, asks Andrew Johnson to
				inquire about the pension earned for the military service of a Mr. Curtis for
				his widow. The pension would entitle her to $20.00 per year. The second letter
				from Andrew Johnson tells Mr. McDannel that he is working on his cases, has
				received all of his letters, and will keep him informed about his cases.
				Johnson informs Mr. McDannel that he will send the information of his cases to
				the Secretary of War for his review as well.</note>
