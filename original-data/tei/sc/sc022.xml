               <note type="summary">This document is a letter dated February 11,
				1825, from David Crockett in Washington D.C. to James L. Totton in Trenton,
				Tennessee. In the letter, Crockett discussed the rising political status of
				General Andrew Jackson, who he predicted would soon "receive the rewards of his
				merit." Crockett also spoke of his proposal for the construction of a new mail
				route, which would be addressed in a bill at the end of that session of
				Congress.</note>
