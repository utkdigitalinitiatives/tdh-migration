This is only for my own information and if there is any proof <unclear>warranted</unclear> I want to know what it is in order that as may be taking it  as we may be <orig reg="ready">redy</orig> for trial at the may term.  we want the case brought to a close as soon as possible.  we have <orig reg="learned">lerned</orig> that <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Hendrson has again hired out the negroes for the present year.  and sold the land &amp; we also have learned that the suit against Driver in the <name>Louisiana</name> circuit court was tried and judgement went against Driver for some 7 or 8 $ which is not more than half the value of the negores sued for, but we learn that Henderson has got the negroes for the judgement.  if he has <orig reg="done">don</orig> that it will do. but I do not know  how what is in your last letter you wrote that the suit had not been tried but shortly we  learn by a letter from  Henderson to <name>John Reynolds</name> that it had been tried so we imagine you was mistaken I wish you to pay some Little attention to the way Henderson is hiring the negroes.&amp; see what he has done with Ours negores.  Write me fully on receipt of this what has been done.  Tubb &amp; Reynolds is very anxious, to hear.  &amp; whether it is necessary for any of us to come out. &amp; see it any thing in person that we ought to attend to.
