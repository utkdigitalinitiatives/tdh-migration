I regret to hear of <name type="person">Sophia Craigheads</name> severe illness. Although I am not surprised. I expected to hear of it by every mail. I knew she could not remain as she was when I left that there must be a change either for the better or worse, and from the nature of her disease. I anticipated the latter. I am sorry the visit to the springs did not improve Margarets health.</p><p>As to Mothers being "desolate since I left." I would write to her, but I think I will comfort her by my presence before a great while, for I would not live in this town for any consideration, there is &caret; <add place="supralinear">less</add> sociability here than any place I ever was in, there is no place that you can get among the <emph>gentle men</emph> of the place but at the grocery, there you will find people of every class, and every age from the boy of ten years old to the old man of seventy, all drink, young &amp; old, play cards, tell vulgar anecdotes, and vice in every shape may be seen, and that too by the best citizens of the town, and Sunday is kept by them no holier than any other day, As to the mechanics <pb n="[2]"/> they are scarce, out side of the Factory there are none, except a Blacksmith, a Tailor or two <abbr expan="et cetera">&amp;c</abbr>. I have not heard the sound of hammer or saw, in the way of improvement, since I have been here. I am like the Irishman, who said that it was the first <del type="overstrike">place</del> town &caret; <add place="supralinear">that he had seen</add> in his life that was completed. I will remain here a week or two longer and think I will return to <name type="place">Knoxville</name>. I am keeping the Post Master,  <name type="person">Mr. C. Stone</name>, from closing the mail. My love to all relations.</p><closer><salute>Yours Always</salute><signed><name type="person">Carrick W. Park</name></signed><pb n="[3]"/> <address><addrLine><name type="person">Mr. James M.
