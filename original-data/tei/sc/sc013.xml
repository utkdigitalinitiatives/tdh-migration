                  <name type="person">Major Perrault</name> of the Topographical
			 Department having a few days since reported himself at this place. I have
			 determined not to await the return of 
			 <name type="person">
                     <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Young</name>
			 but immediately to commence opening the contemplated military road from the
			 northern <orig reg="boundary">boundery</orig> of the 
			 <name type="place">Mississippi Territory</name> to the lake
			 <orig reg="Ponchetrain">Pon cher train</orig>, commencing at the first named
			 point with the troops (one company) <del type="overstrike">now</del> at 
		  <name type="place">Fort Hampton</name>, <orig reg="until">untill</orig>
		  the affair of the upper Mississippi will justify the removal of the two
		  companies of the 8th Infantry now there.  Orders have been given to 
		  <name type="person">General Ripley</name> to furnish two companies to
		  commence cutting at the southern extremity of the road under the directions of 
		  <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Young, 
		  <abbr expan="Topographical">Topo.</abbr> Engineer, who has been
		  instructed to open its thirty feet wide, causway all marshes  swamps 20
		  feet wide, raising them above high water mark, and to make bridges of durable
		  materials over all streams that their means will permit. </p> 
		  
               <p>It is much to be regretted that the 
			 <abbr expan="Topographical">Topo</abbr> Engineers have not been
			 furnished with the necessary mathematical instruments, as none can be procured
			 here, and <pb n="[2]"/> Major Perrault's <add place="superlinear">total</add>
			 want thereof, will, I am apprehensive, cause delay <orig reg="until">untill</orig> they can be obtained from

                     </name>, as it is improbable that he can
			 procure either a quadrant or Sextant to take the latitude, necessary on
			 commencing the road at the north point of beginning. But as it appears to be
			 important to connect the different sections of land cut by this road, and
