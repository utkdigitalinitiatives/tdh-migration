		  <opener><salute>Gentlemen,</salute></opener><p>The reasons I have to offer for an application to you for the name of the author of the article signed " A Citizen of <name>Nashville</name>" are such as must, I think, readily suggest themselves to your minds.  The article in question contains a direct personal attack upon me by name, in such a manner is according to all the principles of fair dealing, entitles me to know by whom I am this assailed: and when an editor admits such articles into his columns, I have always understood him bound to make known the name of the author to the person assailed, or as assuming, by a refusal, the responsibilities of the authorship upon himself.</p><p>Under these circumstances, I presume you will no longer hesitate to comply with my request.</p>
