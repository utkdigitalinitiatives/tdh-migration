Several of the Anti Masons from Harrisburg have been corresponding with me about Masonry; I imagine my answer will be unsatisfactory__ I tell them I am not and never was a Mason_ That I must decline giving an opinion about the principles and obligations of Masons because I have not sufficient in formation to enable me to form one satisfactory to myself <pb n="[2]"/> I am told the Boats to <name>Philadelphia</name> are locked up in the ice.
