Oh! Jane how much I wish you were here to converse with me face to face, instead of <del>being</del> writing to you for I have <del type="overstrike">so</del> so much to tell you if I could see you, that I cannot write.</p><p>Would you not prefer being in our little village enjoying yourself with us instead of being confined at school with those dry studies; yes I know you would.  <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> &amp; <abbr expan="Misses">Mrs</abbr> Knox, <name>Gene Crockett</name>, and <name>Mary Park</name>, are now with us, and you cannot imagine what fine times we have.  We had a party on Sunday, and are to have another <del>on</del>  tonight and three or four next week.  Do <add place="supralinear">you</add> not think that this is doing very well for our little town the population not exceeding 1600 inhabitants. <pb n="[2]"/> You cannot imagine how many leave the girls here.   Since they have been staying at Mrs. <unclear>Aderms</unclear> the house has been more like an inn than a private house.  Jane has taken in the <abbr expan="Honorable">Hon</abbr> <name>EJ Shields</name>, and Maury the handsome and dignified <del>Cou</del> Count Leathermen, and a dozen others too numerous to mention</p><p><unclear>Jane how did you hear of May day.</unclear>  I do not think I ever enjoyed myself so much in my life.  We had no Queen, but a delightful fire-one party in the woods.  We were gone all day, and had our dinner sent to us; returned to town late in the  evening, and had <add place="supralinear">a</add> party that night.</p><p>Jane did you ever hear of so many marriages in your life. I declare it beats bob tail.  I expect by this time <name>Hate Hearney</name>    is a married man; we received a letter from him a few days ago, and he was to start the next day for his license.  I believe he is to <del>be</del> be united in the silken hands of matrimony to Miss <name>Mary Harris</name> of <name>Vicksburg</name>.  I am not going to believe it until I hear that he is married  He is always going to be  married but never makes it out, at least has not heretofore.     You wish to know what had become of <name>Dave Reynolds</name>.  Did you not know that he was married He was married to <name>Mary Abernathy</name> (cousin Oscar's old sweetheart) before I left <name>Nashville</name> I tell you what these college chaps "beats all nature" dont they?  They pretend to love mighty hard at first but they very soon get over it   <name>Tom Brown</name>, and <name>Alf Albernathy</name> are still here but they go by the appellation of the Exclusives.  There have <add place="supralinear">been</add> several college boys here lately, and amongst them was little <name>Billy Pikes</name> <pb n="[3]"/> Were you not acquainted him.  He was wonderfully taken with <name>Eliza Jane Brambitt</name>.</p><p>But it is time for me to stop with my foolishness, as I have not time to write anymore now, as I have no  less than four more letters to write this morning.  Jane answer  this soon if you please and Jane be sure to come <add place="supralinear">home</add> this summer.</p><closer>Give my love to all the girls, and believe <add place="supralinear">me</add> your Sincere Friend &amp; cousin <name>Sarah Bet</name> <pb n="[4]"/> <address><addrLine>Miss Jane T Wood Care of Miss Hawks Philadelphia  Pennsylvania <add>Mail</add></addrLine></address></closer></div1>
