			 <note type="summary">This document is a letter dated March 22, 1829 from Andrew Jackson to William Donelson.  The subject of the letter is Jackson's son Andrew Jackson Hutchings, who came under Jackson's supervision after the death of his father John Hutchings.  The tone of the letter is one of regret at Hutchings' poor performance as a student, and the resignation that he will not be a classical scholar, but may be more aptly suited to life as a farmer.</note>

This intelligence is a sore grief to me, and one from his pledge to me, of good behaviour, &amp; application to his Book, and strict adherence to the rules of the university, &amp; the orders of the professors, I was not prepared to hear, I was not prepared you may say to him to hear of his disgrace, which I had taken so much pains, by my frequent admonitions to prevent, nor did I believe he would so far forget himself, as to inflict such a wound on my feelings, if he was regardless of his own__  But it is so, and I must adopt such measures, as will yet preserve him from ruin, &amp; myself from disgrace.</p><p>On the receipt of this my dear friend can I ask the goodness of you, forthwith to take him &amp; enter him with Mr. Otey at Franklin, &amp; advise <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Coffee thereof, &amp; draw upon him for the amount of his Tuition &amp; Board in favour of <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr>. Otey.  I have this day wrote Genl Coffee that I would thus direct you, &amp; he will be prepared to meet your draft for Hutchings board &amp; tuition.</p><p>Say to Mr. Otey I wish him instructed in writing &amp; arithmetic so that he may become a good Book keeper, as I find it <pb n="[2]"/> useless to attempt to make him a good classic scholar; and all I now hope for is, to give him an education to fit him for a farmer.  If he can be restrained &amp; governed, I would wish him to study algebra &amp; some branches of mathematics, with Belle letters, &amp; natural &amp; moral philosophy, and review his greek &amp; latin which he has read.</p><p>My Dr Sir write me on the receipt of this and let me know how your dear little Elisabeth is, &amp; whether poor poll the favourite bird of my dear wife is still living.  present me affectionately to Elisabeth to your father &amp; mother, and all our relations.  Say to them that we are all well &amp; all send their love to them &amp; believe me respectfully your friend</p>
