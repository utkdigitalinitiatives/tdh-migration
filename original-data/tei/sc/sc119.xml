If I do go it will be <pb n="2"/> soon and by way of <name>St Louis</name>. I would have gone to <name>St. Louis</name> next week but I learned that the <name>Mississippi River</name> was Frozen up so that Boats could not go so high as St. Louis   The business that will take me to <abbr expan="St. Louis">St L</abbr>- is to deliver to the <abbr expan="United States Quarter">US Qr</abbr> Master US Army One hundred and Fifty tons of Commissary &amp; Ordinance Stores for which I made a contract <del type="overstrike">frth</del><add>with</add> the Qr Master at Cherokee agency in the name of <unclear>NB French &amp; Co</unclear> at the same time I made a contract <add>for them</add> with the Qr Master to transport the 4th Regiment of Us Infantry from the <name>Cherokee agency</name> to <name>Tuscumbia <abbr expan="Alabama">Ala</abbr></name>. They will clear on the 2 contracts about six Thousand dollars.

In one of my former communications to you I asked your advice as to whether it would be best to still continue on the Holston or to take a situation at a lower <orig reg="salary">salery</orig> in the owners House in Knoxville You have not said anything in your letters on the subject a short time since I spoke to them on the Subject they <orig reg="offered"> offerd</orig> me the command of the <name>Holston</name> or a situation in their house in Knoxville the former I declined and the latter I excepted But promised to take command of the boat for <unclear>Mrs arthur</unclear> <pb n="3"/> until she gets family underway. I will leave her and go to <name>Knoxville</name> in a few days to which place you in future will please direct your letters to me I received a letter from Rebecca Jane a few days since She says but little She speaks of Fathers death and of the good attention that was paid him during his illness She also says that his<name> Johnstown</name> business was all settled But that his <name>Pittsburgh</name> debts were not paid. She says she has about 275$ of money She says that <unclear>albru</unclear> &amp; childs have not been paid for their debts I <gap reason="hole in document"/> responsible and I intend to pay them they <gap reason="hole in document"/> like Gentlemen with him &amp; I will <orig reg="endeavor">endevour</orig> to follow their example I would go to the North this <unclear>minute</unclear> but I do not want to go until I have money enough to pay their claims</p><p>I am very much pleased with both the country and the people and I am doing business for the best house in Knoxville</p><p>How do you get along. You never <del type="overstrike">speak</del><add>write</add> of your business to me are you doing well</p><p>Rebecca is in a good place and Samuel I think is well provided for. give my Love to Ellen Eliza and a kiss to Mary Jane &amp; Samuel Crawford and for yourself Except my warmest wishes for your welfare</p>
