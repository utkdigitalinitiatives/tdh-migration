				House of Delegates on January 10, 1800. The document summarizes preceding
				congressional acts regarding the cessation of the Southwest Territory from
				North Carolina in 1790, the establishment of "Walker's line" as the boundary of
				North Carolina in 1791, and the creation of the state of Tennessee in 1796. It
				was then resolved that three commissioners be appointed to meet with Tennessee
				commissioners regarding issues concerning the boundary line between the two
				states.</note>

               <p>Whereas it is represented to the present General Assembly, that
			 people living between what are called Walker's and Henderson's lines, so far as
			 the same run between the state of 
			 <name type="place">Tennessee</name> and this state, do not consider
			 themselves under either the jurisdiction of that or this state, and therefore
			 refuse the payment of any taxes to either of the said States, or to the
			 collectors of either for the General Government, because the state of 
			 <name type="place">North Carolina</name>, on the 
			 <date value="1790-02-25">
                     <orig reg="twenty-fifth">twenty fifth</orig>
				day of February 1790</date>, ceded the said State of Tennessee, then called the
			 
			 <name> Southwestern Territory</name>, to the Government of the 
			 <name type="place">United States</name>; and therefore the act
			 entitled "an act concerning the southern boundary of this state," passed on the
			 
			 <date value="1791-12-07">seventh of December 1791</date> , in this
			 legislature to establish the line commonly called Walker's line, as the
			 boundary between 
			 <name type="place">North Carolina</name> and this state, could
			 <add place="bottom right corner">only</add> 
                  <pb n="[2]"/> only bind the state of
			 North Carolina as far as her territorial limits extended on the line of this
			 state, and could not bind the said southwestern Territory, which had been
			 previously conveyed as aforesaid: And whereas since the said Cession the
			 General Government hath erected the said Southwestern Territory into an
			 <orig reg="independent">independant</orig> state, by their act of 
			 <date value="1796-06-01">June the first 1796</date>, whereby it has
			 become the duty of the said State of Tennessee and of this state to settle all
			 differences between them with respect to the said boundary line.
               </p> 
		  
               <p>Resolved therefore, that the Executive be authorized and requested
			 to appoint three Commissioners, whose duty it shall be to meet Commissioners to
			 be appointed by the State of Tennessee to settle and adjust all differences
			 concerning the said boundary line, and to establish the one or the other
			 <add place="bottom right corner">of</add> 
                  <pb n="[3]"/> of the said lines, as
			 the case may be, or to run any other line which may be agreed on for settling
			 the same; and that the Executive be also requested to transmit a copy of this
			 resolution to the Executive Authority of the State of Tennessee.
