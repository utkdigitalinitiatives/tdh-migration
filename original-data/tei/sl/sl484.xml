I shall be very much gratified if he can be accommodated in this case; where not only his own private interest, but that of his friends are jeopardized.  Major Van de Venter is a gentleman of honorable reputation and I am satisfied any <add>reasonable</add> injunctions which may be prescribed to him in his parole, if granted, will be faithfully observed and kept on his part.</p><p>I had the honor to receive in due time your Excellency's note of the 3d ultimo in which you are pleased to inform me that the correspondence between yourself and General Dearborn, upon the subject of an exchange of prisoners of war, were then before the <name>American</name> government, <abbr expan="and et cetera">&amp;c</abbr>.  I hope, ere this time, it has terminated satisfactorily to both parties, and that prisoners of war will soon experience the benefit thereof.  But, should it be otherwise, I again take leave to solicit your attention to the situation of <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr>.  <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr>. Lewis, Major Madison, and two or three other militia officers, prisoners of war.  This class of military men, I mean militia, in all nations, I believe, receive more indulgence than regular troops, from the consideration of their coming into service under the existing laws of their country, and in the United <pb n="[2]"/> States always for a limited time, of short duration.  Under these circumstances, not making a profession of arms; the arrangement of their private concerns are made for a short time, of course, will suffer materially by their long absence.  Independent of their pledge of honor, they have no earthly motive to induce them to perform military service until regularly exchanged; in fact if they were so exchanged at this time it would not, in all probability, come to their turn to serve again in the militia in two, and perhaps not in three years.  Thus situated, I persuade myself, your Excellency will have no objections to granting parole to the militia officers, at least, to return to their homes within the United States.</p> <closer>I have the honor to be, with sentiments of high respect, your Excellencys Obedient Servant, <signed><abbr expan="James">J</abbr> Winchester</signed> <abbr expan="Brigadire General">BGenl</abbr> us army <add>His Excellency <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr>.
