The first is a letter White writes from a military camp near Turkey Town, dated November 7, 1813.  White discusses General Andrew Jackson's advancements at the present stage of the War of 1812.  The second letter is a copy of a letter written from General Jackson to White, four days earlier on November 4.  In that letter, Jackson describes his  army's advancement to Ten Island, as well as a very brief description of a battle between General Coffee and  Native Americans, in which all of the Native Amer. men were killed and the women and children taken prisoner.      </note><note type="collection">John Cocke Papers V-J-3</note><note type="box">3</note><note type="folder">8</note><note type="document">sl139</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker;
