The author is probably Adam Fergusson. The letter is to an agent involved with treaties with Native nations. Fergusson is trying to find information on Mary Jameson, an American who, as a child was taken captive by a Seneca tribe in New York state. He wants to find out if she has any living descendants in order to ascertain whether her two brothers in Tennessee are  her legal heirs. This is in relation to land given by the Seneca Nation in a treaty with the United States.</note><note type="collection">Fergusson Papers</note><note type="box">IV-G-1, B6</note><note type="folder">3</note><note type="document">sl421</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>New York</item><item>Seneca Nation</item><item>Land question</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name>Carthage</name> <name>Tennessee</name></addrLine><addrLine><date>24th the march 1841</date></addrLine></address><salute>Sir</salute></opener><p><del type="overstrike">I am instructed to write the following by those who are interested</del> about 15 or 20 years ago there died a woman among the <name>Seneca</name> <add>tribe</add>  Indians of your State named <name>Mary Jameson</name> otherwise called the <del type="overstrike">Indian</del> white woman she lived in the <name><orig reg="Genesee valley">Genese valey</orig> </name> upon what was called the Gardow tract a reservation of about ten thousand acres.
