When <name type="person">Ben Robertson</name> professed he was very anxious to see <name type="person">Chris Dickson</name>, but he was equally as anxious to avoid him, and although they were both on the same ground they did not meet <orig reg="until">untill</orig> the next day, and those that witnessed it say it was a very affecting scene.  At the close of the meeting, which commenced on the <date value="1837-09-08">8</date> and lasted <orig reg="until">untill</orig> the <date value="1837-09-13">13</date>, <name type="person">Prior Smith</name> stood upon a bench and prayed for and <orig reg="exhorted">exorted</orig> the Preachers &amp; Christians very much and said that it was right they should part to <orig reg="propagate">propogate</orig> religion for they were the salt of the earth, and <name type="person">John James</name>' excellent prayers for <name type="person">Eliza</name>'s conversion astonished them all very much.  <name type="person">Eliza &caret; <add place="supralinear">H</add></name> and <name type="person">Mary C</name> laughed and shouted very much indeed they were affected in the same manner they were when they took <unclear>either</unclear> <name type="person">Eliza</name> said she always thought she would cry when she professed religion but she did not feel like crying now.  There were a great many preachers present among the   <unclear>number</unclear> were <name type="person">Mr Burniep</name> &amp; <name type="person">Mr Ray</name>, the former has improved very much, but I think one of our circuit &caret; <add place="supralinear">riders</add> <name type="person">Mr Pope</name> excels him.  There is to be a three days meeting at <name type="place">New Hope</name> the third week in next month and if the neighbors will camp on the ground there will be  preaching as long as they can do any good or the people will attend The Methodists had an appointment for a two days meeting on <name type="place">White Oak</name> last month and the people appeared so anxious and willing to attend that it continued six days <pb n="[3]"/> and it is said 63 persons professed religion.  <name type="person">Mr Edwards</name> has been here, and we are all very much pleased with him.  <name type="person">Mrs Wade</name>  &amp; <name type="person">James</name>  , <name type="person">Mrs McLaughlin</name> &amp; daughter left here this morning after spending one day and two nights with us,  there has been a revival of religion at <name type="place">Spring Hill</name>.
