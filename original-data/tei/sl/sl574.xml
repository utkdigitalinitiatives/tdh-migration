I think you said it was $200__     you also said on being second in this sum, you would convey the title.  One of the lots I have second to myself, at considerable sacrifice.   It is valuable, and somewhat improved I wish you would take it at anything like a fair price for I know not when I shall be able to pay you this money neither the ballance I owe  on the <orig reg="account">acuout</orig> Or if not this lot, take my <name>Drakes creek land</name>.  I have never before been so embarrassed as respects money matters. not my own, but other peoples debts.  the <abbr expan="amount">amt</abbr> is not great, but such is the difficulty in <orig reg="getting">geting</orig> hold of money.  that I as yet know not how to overcome it.  you know I have always been a bad hand this way.

I hear that an attempt to murder has been <unclear>lately</unclear>  made in your neighborhood__  and of several <pb n="[3]"/> murders in other quarters, of <unclear>recent</unclear> date.  It appears that society is becoming more &amp; more vicious.  What is or can, be done to correct this inordinate passion?
