Donelson in Tallahassee, Florida.  Daniel writes urgently to report that he was accosted about a political scandal involving Andrew and two men by the names of Bell and Barrow.  Daniel fears that his brother's image is being tarnished in order to reflect negatively on the President, their uncle Andrew Jackson.</note><note type="collection">Bettie M.

With whom Bell, was my reply?  no.  Barrow-he then proceeded to say that you had gotten a friend in <name><abbr expan="Tennessee">Ten.</abbr></name> to call on <name>Mr. Barrow</name>  to know when he would be out of the limits of the State of Ten. and as a reason for the enquiry the laws of the State; he stated that he understood to what allusion was made, and that he would or expected to spend a month or <pb n="[2]"/> two in <del type="overstrike">in</del> Washington this winter. Col. Butler also mentioned that <name><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Jackson</name> knew nothing of what was transpiring, and that you wished the whole affair should be kept from him until it was <add>settled</add> upon the field this was the idea.  Mr. Butler, stated that he got his information from a very confidential source therefore could not mention the author's name.  Now Andrew if there be any truth in all this I feel not a little mortified that you should have kept it so profoundly secret from me I am your Brother and as such I now demand <add>it</add> as a right to know how you stand in relation to this matter- give me a detailed account of the whole, and if there be anything like a fair prospect for a meeting such as I have described, of course I will be with you.  When I left Ten. I resolved in my own mind to have  as little to do with the political world as pos- <pb n="[3]"/> sible, this determination up to this time I have complied with, as my letters to you and others will show- not long since I was informed by a friend in Tallahassee of the charges <add>which</add> were pressed against you by the <name>Nashville</name> papers and of the bitterness with which you were assailed- <del></del> I forthwith made an examination into the matter and at once saw the dastardly design in view, that of effecting the President through to you- I believed then and do still believe that <name>John Bell</name>, a man then whom there is none <add>more</add> <unclear>base</unclear>, was the prime mover and manager in the plot- and here I take the liberty of suggesting that he, Bell, is the man <add>who</add> should be punished, Barrow is an Editor whose avocation it is to lie and misrepresent, therefore nothing can be gained by having an affair with him suffer him then, if you are not too far committed, to pass, and strike at the fountain head- if it can be so arranged suffer <pb n="[4]"/> me to take your place in regard to Barrow on the consideration that you must attend to Bell- these are suggestions for your consideration.  Let me hear how you <unclear>forthwith</unclear> <gap/>  on the reception of this- you can imagine my anxiety of mind.</p> <closer><signed><abbr expan="General Daniel">Genl.
