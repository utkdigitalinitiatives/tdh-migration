They were from Middle <name>Tennessee</name> &amp; being all here together &amp; uncertain, whether they would unite   (any portion of them) with any other troops of the States, they were organized into one Regiment  &amp; officered accordingly.  I provisioned them with ten days rations &amp; chartered Steam Boats for their Transportation to N.

This has all  been done under my order no. 2 which I forwarded to you.  The cavalry companies will be at Memphis by the 15th  Inst. except three from E. Tennessee which will be there in a few days after  There to await the orders of <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Wool <lb/> you will perceive that <pb n="[2]"/> to make this prompt movement, that I found it necessary as directed by you in your letter of the 16th to appoint an Inspector to muster them into the service, there being no <name>United States </name>officer here for the purpose.  I have no doubt the duty has been well done &amp; the companies selected very fine ones, both infantry &amp; cavalry__ The East Tennessee infantry &amp; the cavalry every where I concluded to muster into service near their homes instead of waiting until the general Rendezvous at Memphis The latter place is 4 or 500 miles from the homes of many of them &amp; such as could not pass muster would be often in a deplorable condition at that distance often without the means of return.  Besides this, it would often happen that volunteers could not have money enough of their own to defray their expenses that distance when mustered into service the State could make advances under the head of Transportation &amp; provisioning, which the <abbr expan="United">U</abbr>. States could refund.  For these &amp; other reasons not necessary now to be mentioned.  I made arrangements to muster the troops into the service before leaving their respective grand divisions of the state &amp; if you have any doubts about the propriety of my having done so, a little conversation with the President in relation to our geographical &amp; Civil Divisions will remove them I desire earnestly that you will give direction to the genl in command to permit the 2 Battallions to be united into a Regiment &amp; complete their organization</p><closer>very respectfully <pb n="[3]"/> Your <abbr expan="obedient Servant">obt.
