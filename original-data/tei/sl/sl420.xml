Having myself been born and raised in this country it would Seem that I might <add>be</add> content <del type="overstrike">myself</del> with the knowledge of having <orig reg="descended">decended</orig> from the true Highland race: but having heard my Parents Speak of <name>Scotland</name> and the friends and relations they left behind makes me anxious to know Something more about our family <orig reg="connections">conections</orig> at the distance of almost half a century of time it would be idle for me to adress a letter to any one of our friends living at the time my parents left. We have never heard but little about them Since that period and that little has been <orig reg="very">verry</orig> unsatisfactory. Believing that most of them are past away and that their children <orig reg="Supply">Suply</orig> their places and those not known to me I take the liberty to adress you the first letter making you the organ of our communication <add>between</add> until I find who to adress. My mother was raised at <name><orig reg="Dalmally">Dalmaley</orig></name> the place where I am informed <del type="overstrike">you act as a</del> <add>your</add> Post office is now established     <add><del type="overstrike">and you are the Post master</del> before her marriage</add> Her name was <name>Isable McNable</name> her family <pb n="[2]"/> ranks among the oldest in you country The family of McNable had lived on a Small hill close to the <unclear>Cuplick</unclear> Inn <add>at Dalmaley</add> and occupied the farm and its <orig reg="privileges">priveledges</orig> my uncle <name>Alexander McNable</name> was remarkable for his  excelling in making dirks and other cutlery. My fathers family lived about a days Journey I expect as near as I can guess north at a place called <name>ASedale</name> where <del type="overstrike">an ex tensive state query was in operation</del> <add>they as well as others were engaged in making State</add> the Small farm <add>on which they lived</add> was named  <del type="overstrike">I think</del> Killride as well as I my <orig reg="recollection">recolection</orig> Serves me my uncles were John <add>and</add> <name>Archibald Fergusson</name> my fathers name was <name>Duncan Fergusson</name> the oldest of the Brothers. I have thus given you Some account of my relations left in your country and of whom I have heard my Parents in their lifetime Speak You Sir will do me a great kindness by handing this letter to one of the nearest decendants of either of the above families and also to the one most likely to keep up a <orig reg="correspondence">correspondance</orig> with me I have a great deal to enquire about more than can be contained in a Single letter which I have no doubt would be interesting to them as it would be gratifying to me. I am anxious after So long a lapse of time to renew those ties of blood and affinity that binds friends together even though they live in distant climes and you Sir can be the means of relieving that anxiety by introducing friends and relations to each other who though not forgotten are at this time Strangers. You <pb n="[3]"/> <add>Sir</add> can remove the Spell that locks up the avenues of <orig reg="correspondence">corespondance</orig> and cause <add>us</add> at least to Speak to each other I have reasons to believe that many of my friends live in the United States but as yet I have found but few <add>of them</add> and those few are none of those left in Scotland at the time my father <add>left and</add> came over. I am induced to believe that they have emigrated many of them to other countries and live like me unknown by their friends. You will be kind enough to write to me an answer to this and let me know what information you can about them. Both families had numerous relations and I am thinking will be easy for you to impart information to them If however any of them are living in you country and Should See this letter I ask of them to commence the correspondance <orig reg="immediately">imediately</orig> by writing to me They will give a general History or account from 1790 the time I think my father and his family embarked to this country to the present <unclear>Stating</unclear> who are yet living who <add>may</add> have died and who may have come to the United States of America <add>or went elsewhere</add> and what part of the United States they may now live in I hope you will pardon the trouble this may give you and hope though a Stranger you will accept the assurances of my great esteem and friendship</p><closer><signed><name>Adam Fergusson</name></signed></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
