It is therefore not on account of any fears of me or dislike towards me on the contrary they have manifested a degree of kind partiality for me. They Say they will with pleasure discount a note for you if you get another name instead of mine It will show on their Books they Say that the <orig reg="accommodation">accomodation</orig> is not for me. This course they are compelled to take to Save themselves from censure of partiality or <orig reg="favoritism">favouritsm</orig> Should an investigation take place hereafter I want you to come down to <name>Carthage</name> on or before monday next, even Saturday night if you get this in time as next Saturday is Lodge night I shall have to Stay as court is and will be in Session. I do not expect my bill will take owing to the above objections and as misrepresentations have no doubt been made at the other Banks I shall leave here on tomorrow unless I get matters arranged at the Planters Bank of which I have no expectations. I will <pb n="[2]"/> have to rely upon other resources beside Bank accomodations I could Say a great now but do not wish to place it upon paper This is the result of friends forsaking another in time of need. not that I mean you on the contrary I know you would do whatever lay in your power Be sure to come down if you can and file this letter away where no person can see it but yourself I got here last night almost broke down with fatigue I feel better today. <name>Cass</name> has got a greater number of votes than <name>Taylor</name> yet Taylor is the President I mean a larger popular vote throughout the Union. Nashville is dull to day as it is thanksgiving day.
