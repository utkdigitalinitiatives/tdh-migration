Hamilton to his cousin, James L. Alexander, on September 2, 1838. In the letter, Hamilton tells Alexander about a dinner he went to in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where James K. Polk was giving a speech. He says that there were many Whigs at the dinner. His overall impression of Polk was lessened when he heard the speech and saw his actions with the Whigs at the dinner. Hamilton states that there are country lawyers that give better speeches than Polk.</note><note type="collection">Alexander Papers Correspondence</note><note type="box">VI-G-2</note><note type="folder">2</note><note type="document">sl073</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee -- Politics and government -- To 1865</item><item>Polk, James K.</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><orig reg="Bachelors">Batchelors</orig> Hall <name type="place"><abbr expan="Tennessee">Tenn</abbr></name> <date value="1838-09-02"><abbr expan="September">Sept</abbr> 2nd 1838</date></addrLine></address><salute>Dear Cousin</salute></opener><p>I once more trespass upon the rights of silence.
