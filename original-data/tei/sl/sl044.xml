In the letter, Jackson informs Chester that his nomination as surveyor has been rejected by the Senate because he is not a resident of Mississippi. Jackson's attempts to get the Senate to reverse their decision was futile, and they appointed a man that had previously been turned down for the same reason as Chester. </note><note type="collection">Tennessee Historical Society</note><note type="box">Miscellaneous documents J1</note><note type="folder">52J</note><note type="document">sl044</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>United States -- Politics and government -- 1829-1837</item><item>Surveyors</item><item>United States</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Washington</name> <date value="1833-03-03">March 3rd 1833</date> &mdash;</addrLine></address><salute>My <abbr expan="Dear">Dr</abbr> Sir</salute></opener><p>Yours of the 14th <abbr expan="ultimo">ult.</abbr> was duly received &mdash; The <orig reg="Chickasaw">Chickesaw</orig> treaty was ratified by the Senate on the 1st instant, and on yesterday your name as Surveyor was presented to them &mdash; with a receiver &amp; Register.
