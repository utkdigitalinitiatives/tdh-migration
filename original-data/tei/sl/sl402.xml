As I can not raise the money  to pay the balance of the notes you endorsed for me, I have concluded to apprise you that the horses are mine, and that you may sell them to pay the debt, as far as they will go. They are a pair of handsome grey horses- (Saml knows them) and as good a pair of carriage horses as are in the state. All I ask is that you will make the most you can out of  them, which I know you will do. I have refused $500 for then repeatedly- but do not expect they will command it in your market. Take whatever measures may be necessary to get them into possession, should there be any difficulty about it. Dewitt has no earthly claim to them-- I only loaned them to him, to carry his family to <name>Texas</name>, but as he is not going there with them, I want you to get the benefit of them, as I cannot raise the money to  <unclear>relieve</unclear> you. <pb n="[2]"/> As soon as the negro and the horses are sold write me what they bring, and as soon as possible, I will raise the balance in some way and remit it to you. I hope before they press you for it.

I think however, that I am getting my business in a train to adjust it, before a great while.
