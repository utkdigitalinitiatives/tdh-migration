Foster III, son of Tennessee Senator Ephraim Foster, to his mother, dated June 16, 1846. Foster writes from his  station in New Orleans, where he is the captain of a troop of Tennessee Volunteers during the Mexican-American War under the command of Colonel William Campbell. Foster reports that the soldiers are enjoying good health, though there has been one  death, that of a man named McAdams from Shelbyville. He also talks extensively about public parades in New Orleans and how the Tennessee Volunteers are thought of as  the finest troops to have passed through the city.</note><note type="collection">Foster Family</note><note type="box">Correspondence Robert C.
