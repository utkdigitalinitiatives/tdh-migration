			 <note type="summary">This document is a rough draft composition of a letter  to  former Tennessee state senator Andrew Jackson.  The letter is written by the governor of the state, John Sevier of Koxville, Tennessee, and  is dated August 29, 1798.  In the letter, Sevier informs Jackson that he has heard from respectable sources that if appointed to a position of judgeship, he would accept; the letter is an official offer from the governor's office for the position.  Jackson would accept, and serve the Superior Court of Tennesse from 1798-1804, he would later become the seventh president of the United States in 1829.</note>
