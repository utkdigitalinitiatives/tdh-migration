Martin, Jr. to Andrew Jackson Donelson, who was acting as ambassador to Prussia at the time. Included is another letter from Martin to his sister. Martin writes Donelson about his land in Arkansas. Martin updates Donelson on the tax situation and says that no one wants to buy any of Donelson's land, just yet. Mr. Duncan has told Martin emigrants may want some land when they arrive in January. Martin updates Donelson on his farm: cotton, corn, hogs, sheep, and cattle. He expects cotton prices to rise by March. Martin also mentions that a slave, John Fulton wishes he had accompanied Donelson to Berlin. The second letter is to Martin's sister. Martin informs her of how the family is doing and how much they miss her. He also mentions local politics. He predicts that Henry Clay will be the next president.</note><note type="collection">A. J.

I settled this sum by Mr Duncans draft on me in <orig reg="favor">favour</orig> of <name><abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> E Woodruff</name>. Cousin Daniel paid me $42.50, which I supposed would be half the Taxes at the time it was received. Mr Duncan writes that there is but little prospect of selling any of your lands in <abbr expan="Arkansas">Ark.</abbr> at this time, but that emigrants are expected in <name>Clark &amp; Union Counties</name> in this month and January. I have written to him, requesting that he would inform me if he should hear of any one that wishes to purchase any of your land, and telling him that any of your lands in Arkansas can be had for $150 <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> acre cash or $200 one third cash the balance in one and two years with good secured notes: I have made him an offer of your entire interest in Arks lands for $1500 cash; if he will give this, I think we had better accept it, but this I would not do until I should get your consent. for the present I have abandoned the idea of going to Arks this winter, and unless I have more <orig reg="favorable">favourable</orig> accounts of the probability of selling your lands, I will postpone my trip until next winter.</p><p>I saw your overseer <name>Mr Smith</name> on yesterday, who was busy repairing your Cotton press. he has employed <name>Mr Jackson</name> to assist him at $1.00 pr day, and says he can have the job completed for about $10.00: he finished pecking <pb n="[2]"/> Cotton about two weeks since amounting to the use of 100.000 <abbr expan="pounds">lbs</abbr> and has just finished gathering in the corn but does not know the exact amount, he says however that he will have plenty to do him the ensuing year. he has killed sixty four hogs averaging 140 lbs. and has twenty yet to kill, which he says will average 150 lbs. he has a fine quantity of young hogs turned out for next years pork: but says you have entirely <orig reg="too">two</orig> many cattle and sheep: Cotton has fallen from 1 a 1&frac12; &cent; since the market opened having ranged from 6&frac12; to 9&frac12; and commands now from 7&frac12; to 8&frac14;, <del type="overstrike">and</del> they are making very great difference in the quality of cotton in <name>Nashville</name> this season: it is thought that by the 1st March cotton will command from 12 to 14 &cent; the crop being short in <name>Alabama</name>. <name><abbr expan="Mississippi">Miss.</abbr></name> <name><abbr expan="Louisiana">Lou.</abbr></name> Arkansas &amp; <name>Texas</name>. Cousin Daniel has just returned from your Miss farm — I have not seen him — but Mr Smith says he informed him that you will make a very fair crop there.

Aunt Martha is well. Cousin <name>Andrew Jackson</name> and Cousin Sarah have just returned from a trip to the north with which they were very much pleased: all the neighbors are well excepting <name>Mrs Shute</name>   who it is thought has the consumption.
