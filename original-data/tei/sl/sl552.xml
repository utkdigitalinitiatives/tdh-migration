McKee reports on the business of recruitment service, specifically, that  during the winter season most Choctaw gun-owners are currently engaged in hunting food for their families, and therefore, that his quarter should not be relied upon until their return.  He also mentions the recent  victory of General Andrew Jackson  at the Battle of New Orleans against the British, and as a result, the Choctaw Indians will probably not be needed there.</note><note type="collection">James Winchester Papers</note><note type="box">3</note><note type="folder">5</note><note type="document">sl552</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee -- History</item><item>Letters</item><item>Choctaw Agency (U.S.)</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="Letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine>Choctaw Agency</addrLine></address> <date><abbr expan="January">Jany</abbr> 20 1815</date> <salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener><p>I have the honor to receive your letter of the 6 instant</p><p>Before this can reach you, you will have been advised by <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> Dinssnoor of the prospect of auxiliaries from the District of the <name>Choctaws</name> where he is stationed.
