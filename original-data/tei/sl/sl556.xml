I am the only one who makes any spirited opposition, every thing else yielding before her. Your departure (as you will suppose) has considerably diminished the number of our visitors; either because Eze's accomplishments are not well known, on the fear of an eruption, keeps those at a distance who would lay siege to her heart. D.L. has spent one day with us since you left here, subsequent to which were our guests have been few.  Ensure as many Beaux as you can, for you are likely to lose those you left behind Mr. Trousdale and <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> Sanders are both to be married in a very short time.  I find from your letter to father and mother, in which you have attempted to describe your disappointment in the appearance of the City and manners of the inhabitants, that you are not much pleased with either.  Val is the same <orig reg="self-important">selfimportant</orig> personage as ever, never opposing those who would lead him by the nose, except where he is aroused and his dormant passions are brought into action, there as usual, every one gets out of his way as fast as they can some days since Miss Greene paid a visit to the family at the fort, which failed not to set the house in an uproar.  The Hall of course displayed to her wandering eyes all its magnificence and splendor, which were highly improved by the arrangements of the mat handed Louisa.

Jim who might have done well has acquired such habits of laziness that nothing can excite him. Having by this time pretty well exhausted my stave, which, <unclear>bye the bye</unclear> I have been collecting ever since your departure, and <add>having</add> searched the dictionary in vain for another hard word, I have come to the determination of telling you some thing concerning myself.  since you departed hence.  I have been a kind of solitary not having much intercourse with anyone.  Your absence has deprived me of the pleasure of engaging often in my favorite game of backgammon, of which I have played but one or two hits. The fear of fatiguing my own self particularly, and some little consideration for your patience caution me to forbear</p><closer>Yours <signed>NBW</signed> <pb n="[3]"/> <add>Caroline, I write this in order to thank you for the valuable consignment directed to me, and to free your mind from any uneasiness by assuring you that the floors are scoured once a week at least, and that Val cleans his feet well at the door.  you will be glad to hear I suppose that father is having the walk in front of the house curbed and graveled.
