Mr Wade was taken Sick on wednesday last and died on friday night with <orig reg="inflammation">inflamation</orig> of the brain; and is one of those instances to remind us how frail is man. My nephew above named is an applicant for the office. Mr <name>Daniel D Claibourne</name> another nephew is also an applicant I regret this as they are both nephews one a brothers and the other a Sisters Son consequently I could Say nothing in <orig reg="favor">favour</orig> of one more than the other they are both sprightly young men and either will make a good clerk by a little experience. Their <orig reg="politics">politicks</orig> (Democrats) are the Same Should you feel unwilling to decide between them, I have instructed Ira Fergusson bearer hereoff to withdraw his claims as an act of generosity towards an absent relative I also include his <add>Claibournes</add> letter to me as an act of Justice towards him every word of which is Substantially true. I did as far back as last December or before that time promise to aid him <add>Daniel D Claibourne</add> in the obtaining this <orig reg="very">verry</orig> office Should Mr wade resign.

As to the <orig reg="Public">Publick</orig> interest I think it entirely Safe in the appointment of either and I am willing to Stand as Security in the appointment of either. I am well acquainted with the whole population of macon county and know of no other persons more Suitable there may be Some young Lawyers from <name>Kentucky</name> who have Settled in Lafayette for their own particular interest These have no Sympathy whatever with the old established citizens except Self interest and I hope their claims will not have the Same weight with you Should any of them be urged before <add>you</add> I know it is usual to obtain the letters of Some of the members of the bar in favour of the applicants. In the event you require this I will try and forward Some to meet you at <name>Smithville</name> or at McMinnville</p><closer><salute>with great respect and esteem <lb/> I remain yours truly</salute><signed><abbr expan="Adam">A.</abbr> Fergusson</signed><address><addrLine><abbr expan="Honorable">Honble</abbr> <name>Bromfield S Ridley</name></addrLine><addrLine>Chancellor <abbr expan="etcetera">&amp;c</abbr></addrLine></address><add><abbr expan="Post Script">PS</abbr> You will please return my Brothers letter to me after you read it <lb/> Respectfully <lb/> A Fergusson</add></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
