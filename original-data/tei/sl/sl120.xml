They are from her sisters, Sarah B. Bell and Margaret V. Bell. Sarah has had a cold this week. She writes of where some people are going to school. James Gould has bought them some gifts that he has been unable to send them. She mentions how well liked a preacher named Mr. Pope is. She also says that the weather has been good for the fruit trees. Margaret writes of the muster they recently hosted. Their mother wanted to listen to a Mr. Allen's speech. Apparently the ladies were not allowed to actually attend it. They sat on the porch and had Mr. Allen speak very loudly. She also summarizes the happenings in the neighbors.</note><note type="collection">Bell Collection IV-H-1</note><note type="box">B:1</note><note type="folder">F:11</note><note type="document">sl120</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Communication in the family</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Clover Dale</name> <date value="1837-04-17">April 17th 1837</date></addrLine></address><salute>My dear Sister</salute></opener><p>I wrote you the week after you left, which I hope you have received ere this, we are all very anxious to hear from you, I thought you would certainly have written a few lines to us from <name type="place"><abbr expan="Cinncinnati">Cincti</abbr></name> or <name type="place"><orig reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburg</orig></name>, <name type="person">Mr. T Collier</name> read part of his brothers letter to us, saying you were well and in exc<add place="supralinear">el</add>lent health, that you spent a day with your cousin <name type="person">Mr. W.
