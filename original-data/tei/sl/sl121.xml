She complains that her family would not let her write to Jane because they were worried Jane would not want to pay the postage.   She writes that the family has been concerned for her and that their mother wants to know what kind of medicine she is taking. Sarah updates Jane on the news from the neighborhood, sicknesses, marriages, etc.  The sisters are trying to decide between a barbecue or  a speech on temperance as their July 4th activities. Margaret has greatly enjoyed the book The Three Eras of a Woman's Life. They did not like Mrs. Cary's book because she thinks that all women should be punished for what Eve may have done, and the sisters do not agree. Sarah wants to be sure that Jane will send her a copy of her piece on Presentiment and her anecdote.</note><note type="collection">Bell Collection IV-H-1</note><note type="box">1</note><note type="folder">11</note><note type="document">sl121</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Tennessee</item><item>Religious thought -- 19th century</item><item>Temperance and religious</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Clover Dale</name>. <date value="1837-06-27">June 27th 1837</date></addrLine></address><salute>My dear Sister.</salute></opener><p>I have been very anxious to write you for some time past, but the others wished to write, and would not consent to my writing, they thought you would not like to pay the postage of so many letters, I said you must have changed very much since you left home, if you would not be willing to receive a letter from us at any time, and I intended asking you if I might not write to you when ever I wished. It has been some weeks since we received a letter from you, which makes us all feel very anxious fearing you are sick, which I hope is not the case, as I still have a strong presentiment your health will improve, and it is with pleasure I look forward to that period, which I hope is not far distant when, you will return to us as well and cheerful as ever. I miss you more and more every day, if I see hear or read any thing that strikes my fancy, I invariably think of repeating it to you, but the sad <orig reg="recollection">recholection</orig> soon returns, you are absent. We were all agreeably surprised last week, in receiving several numbers of the Presbyterian, it is what we have often wished for, it is not as large a paper as the <name type="place"><orig reg="Nashville">Nashvill</orig></name> Presbyterian but I think it equally as good, yesterday we received <name type="place">Atkinson's</name> Saturday evening news, if all is an it, that it speaks of, it must be quite interesting, my Father complains of the bad print. I hope they are not an additional <orig reg="expense">expence</orig> to brother, as the directions are in your hand writing, we think you have the reading of them. Mother wishes me to say as you are an invalid, you <pb n="[2]"/> ought not to sit up late, and to rise early, she wishes to know if brother allows you much medicine and what kind you take. I saw <name type="person">Mr. Collier</name> last week, as usual, he was very polite, I delivered your message to him, he said, he was afraid he fell short of that attention which he ought to have shown you, but that he told you to attribute it altogether to his inexperience in waiting on ladies, he was glad to to hear his friends had not forgot him, and send his best respects to you all. <name type="peson">Catherine Clement</name> was married some time since, to <name type="person">Mr. Ingum</name> of <name type="place">Dover</name> a widower whose wife died of the Cholera when in that place, her request was if he ever did get married, to have <name type="person">Catherine</name>, her sister <name type="person">Mrs. <unclear>Balis</unclear></name> I expect is dead, <name type="person">Mr. Collier</name> said it was thought she was dying when he left <name type="place">Yellow creek</name>. <name type="person">John Gould</name> is very low with the <orig reg="congestive">conjestive</orig> fever, <name type="person">Dr. Hudson</name> and lady have been with him this last week, he has no hopes of his recovery, <name type="person">Mrs. <abbr expan="Gould">G.</abbr></name> has been in a very low state of health all Spring, I am afraid it will go very hard with her, your company would do her good at this time. <name type="person">Caroline</name> and <name type="person">Margaret</name> read the introduction to <name type="person">Mrs. Cary's</name>letters, and condem<add place="supralinear">n</add>ed the whole book, they thought her too severe in the course of life a woman should lead, if <name type="person">Eve</name> did eat the forbiddin<del type="overstrike">g</del> fruit, they were not <name type="person">Eve</name>, and had no right to make themselves servants for what she had done. <name type="person">Margaret</name>has just finished reading the Three Eras of a womans life, she says it is the first time her eyes have been opened to he difference in the <orig reg="character">charactor</orig> of persons, and thinks it will do her more good than any book she ever read. <name type="person">Dr Carter</name> is to have a barbecue near his house the <date value="1837-07-04"><orig reg="fourth">fouth</orig> of July</date>, <name type="person">Mr. Pope</name> is to give us  Temperance oration the <pb n="[3]"/> same day at <name type="place">New Hope</name>, and as usual, <name type="person">Margaret</name> is at a stand which to give up. <name type="person">Mr. Vanlier</name> does not expect to go on to your city before fall, <name type="person">Mr.<abbr expan="Collier"> C.</abbr></name> says if you are as anxious to see home as you were where he left, you will return with <name type="person">Ellennora</name>, and not wait for spring.
