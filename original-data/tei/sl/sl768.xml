Carroll is informing Newton that he has been chosen to join a group of engineers. These men are to survey a route for a national road being built from Washington D.C. to New Orleans. The road will pass through Tennessee. Carroll gives some suggestions for routes. The engineers are also to survey for the proposed canal connecting the Hiwassee and Coosa Rivers. </note>

		<p>Having no information of the extent of the examination which the Engineers are directed to make I am somewhat at a loss how to instruct you on the subject I shall however State what I conceive to be the wishes of Tennessee in relation to the matters leaving it with you to <orig reg="enforce">inforce</orig> her claims, not doubting but that you will accomplish all that can be effected.</p><p>In the Eastern section of the State it is desired and expected, that the road from the <name>Virginia</name> line through the counties of <name>Sullivan</name> <name>Hawkins</name> and <name>Granger</name> passing through <name>Rogersville</name> and <name>Rutledge</name> to <name>Knoxville</name> shall be examined, as well as the road through the counties of <name>Carter</name> <name>Washington</name> <name>Green</name>, <name>Cocke</name> and <name>Jefferson</name> to Knoxville. From Knoxville to <name>Kingston</name>, the best and I believe the only good route is along the main stage road From the latter place it is very desirable, that a survey should be made not only along the new road that has lately been run by commissioners on the part of this State to <name>sparta</name>, thence along the Stage road by way of <name>McMinnville</name>, <name>Winchester</name> and <name>Salem</name> <pb n="[2]"/> to <name>Huntsville</name>, but also through the counties of <name>Rhea</name> and <name>Hamilton</name> along the main road down what is called the Tennessee valley crossing the Tennessee river at Browns ferry, so as to admit the direct <orig reg="continuance">continuence</orig> of the route in <name>Alabama</name> through <name>Well's Valley</name> There is an other route in the examination of which West Tennessee feels very deeply interested. Many are impressed with a belief that the great national road from Washington city South Westward should terminate at some point on the <name>mississippi river</name>, near the mouth of <name>big Hatchee river</name> If it is inconvenient for the Engineers to make the latter Survey on their way to New Orleans you will <orig reg="endeavour">indeavour</orig> to prevail on them to do so as they return to Washington city.</p><p>It is understood that the Engineers are instructed to make a survey of a route along which a canal would have to pass connecting the waters of the Hiwassee with those of the <name>Coosa</name>. To this subject so essential to the commerce of the Eastern part of the State your attention will be particularly directed.</p><p>It will be proper for you to keep a Journal of the routes examined, noticing the quality of the land through which they pass- the <unclear>elevation</unclear> of the principal hills__ water courses and the convenience of  materials for the construction of good turn pike roads.</p><p>Without adding any thing further the whole matter is submitted to your Judgment and direction</p><closer><salute>I am most respectfully <lb/> <abbr expan="your obedient Servant">yr obt Servt</abbr></salute><signed><name><abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Carroll</name></signed><address><addrLine><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> <name>Newton Cannon</name>,</addrLine><addrLine>Murfreesboro.</addrLine><addrLine>Tennessee.</addrLine></address><pb n="[3]"/><add>Governors Message <lb/> Extra Session <lb/> 1826</add><add><abbr expan="House of Representatives">H.
