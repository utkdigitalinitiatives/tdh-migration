Be pleased to see to the weighing or see Beasley and tell him to weigh if he sees proper with Uncle Bucks Steelyards and if they hold out with Dowdys I will be Satisfied.  We can bring uncle Bucks Steelyard when he comes with the last load and we can try them all I want is the right weight.  You know if he sold to <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> Dowdy he would have to stand his weight I send also a pair of steelyard which if he sees proper he can know whether uncle Bucks hold out or not, they are ten pounds too light in the hundred as tested by Dowdys steelyard on weights last year.  Whatever is right is all I want and if there is any misunderstanding when I see Beasley we will do whatever is right</p><closer>Respectfully <signed>A.
