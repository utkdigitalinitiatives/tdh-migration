I am in the enjoyment of tolerable health &amp; so are the <abbr expan="Colonel's">Cols</abbr> family &amp; the people generally about here. I have been at home about two weeks. I spent several days in <name><name>Davidson</name></name> on my way from  <name>Marshall</name> and I thought I done some decent courting, at any rate, I know I courted at a decent looking girl; but I was in the worst fix for doing anything of the kind that I ever was on any life, The weather as you will probably remember, was oppressively hot &amp; I generally lead two of the worst sort of boils under one or the other arm: there causes kept <add>me</add> a little more than half sick &amp; at last forced me off a little sooner than I would have left under other circumstances. But not with standing all these difficulties I think I got along tolerably well. The business of selling goods is with us, at this time, quite dull; people generally have  tolerable prospects for crops of corn &amp; tobacco- very little excitement about the <abbr expan="Governor's">Govs</abbr> election. Ours you know is a modern democrat county_ we have two democrats out for the lower branch, is <name>Frazier</name> &amp; <name><abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Copeland</name>, both in favor of repealing the <unclear>"?pling act"</unclear> we have one whig opposed to it should the locos continue to run we will lay <pb n="[2]"/> it on them. tho' I think the whiskey law will be more the question than federal polities <add>at</add> any rate it will divide each party against themselves <name>Polk</name> &amp; <name>Jons</name> are to be in town next week and will have a good crowd. I see that the union! <orig reg="correspondent">correspent</orig> from <name>Shelbyville</name> says that <name>Long</name> corners your man <name>Baxter</name> at every point, the Col says if this be true, your men cant be much. The Locos all here had little or nothing to say against the message &amp; until they saw what the union and its correspent from <name>washington</name> said of <name>webster's</name>letter to <name>Fox</name> they admired it very much__ Since that they dont think so well of it. <abbr expan="Gideon">Gid</abbr> , If I live &amp; am well I intend visiting Nashville again on the <date>1 <abbr expan="August">Aug</abbr></date> __ &amp; if I can wind up my matters there as I think I can I will be out to see you in the last of the first week of that month and I want you to hold yourself in readiness to go with me. I think I can shine. If I can I will depend on you for the first pig <abbr expan="etcetera">&amp;c</abbr> after myself. You <orig reg="remember">remmember</orig> that I told you I wanted to do the raking myself. But I think you will be well suited if blood will suit you <abbr expan="id est">ie</abbr> if you call <name>Bell</name> blood <unclear>Paris.</unclear> We have a good deal of rain for the last two weeks,  it now looks like being dry and very warm &amp; I fear that we  will be sickly again this Season tho if I Keep up a few days <pb n="[3]"/> longer I will leave here and only be here occasionally until fall. I have not been to <name>Carroll</name> Since I got home and dont Know much <abbr expan="about">abt</abbr> the people in that region. As I remarked above should I live &amp; keep well &amp; nothing happens I will See you at the time mentioned and hope to find you well. Should you See <name>Miss King</name> say Something good to her for me If I were going to stay at one place long at once I would request you to write but as it is it is not wor<gap/> your while now</p><closer><salute>Very Respectfully</salute><signed><name>W.W.
