My purpose was to look after some claims of my wife to lands in Arkansas which from various causes were in jeopardy. The time consumed by the journey was much greater than I anticipated, and from that cause and a confinement of some four weeks to my bed on account of a surgical operation to which I was obliged to submit, I am in arrears to much of my business, and particularly to you.</p><p>I shall stay in town to night for the purpose of writing you fully, by the next mail.
