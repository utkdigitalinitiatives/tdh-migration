I have however pressed them to examine the papers &amp; see if they would make a <orig reg="favorable">favourable</orig> report upon it, and to day I have been informed that they will decide against the claim on the ground that they will presume payment, or account of the fact that a portion has been paid &amp; the great length of time which has been permitted to elapse. They say they will require explanation &amp; evidence of the cause of the <pb n="[2]"/> delay in making the claim, and how it was that one year was paid,_ They say that the papers which would show the fact of the payment of this claim were burned <del type="overstrike">by</del> by the <orig reg="British">Brittish</orig> in 1814 at the time this capitol was sacked and burned.
