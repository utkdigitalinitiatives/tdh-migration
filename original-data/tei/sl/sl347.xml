Barnett writes about the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and its various members. He is concerned about the legitimacy of some of the preachers. He writes about some pamphlets that the old style Presbyterians have been circulating that are slanderous to the new style, Cumberland Presbyterians. Barnett plans to propose a formal split between the Cumberlands and other Presbyterians  at the next synod,  and asks for Ewing's support. He mentions a possible move to Forked Deer. Barnett also writes that he and others want Ewing to write a history about the origins of the Cumberland Presbyterians. Many people have been expressing curiosity, but cannot find  information them because Buck's Theological Dictionary is out of print.</note><note type="collection">Finis Ewing Papers</note><note type="box">I-A-4</note><note type="folder">2</note><note type="document">sl347</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Kentucky</item><item>Presbyterian Church</item><item>Religious Life</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name>Henderson County</name> <name><abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky</abbr></name><date>June 4th 1823</date></addrLine></address><salute>My very dear Brother Ewing.</salute></opener><p>It has been a long, long time since I either saw you, or received or wrote a scrape to you; I can forbear no longer.</p><p>I returned a few days ago, from the <name>Forked deer</name>, and eager <add>ly</add> went to the Post office in hopes to have received a letter from you, But <orig reg="alas">alass</orig> ! there was none; I called at your <name><abbr expan="Brother">Bro</abbr> young</name> they were all well, and <name>Thompson</name>s Family were also ___</p><p>I saw <name>Bro Cassett</name> he has corrected a part of your <orig reg="piece">peac</orig> , &amp; said he <sic corr="would">would would</sic> finish it as soon as <orig reg="possible">posable</orig> ; and send it on to <name>Russelleville</name>.</p><p>I saw young <name>Guthre</name> he says that a great many of the Preachers feels much disappointed; (and I suppose displeased) that your Book was <del type="overstrike"><add>not</add></del> examined before Synod; (I supposed some of them wished it graced with their <orig reg="talents">tallents</orig> )</p><p>From what I can learn the old <abbr expan="Preachers">P,s</abbr> in the lower part of this state are now of opinion that long as their <unclear>cannon was loading</unclear> that it has fired too soon for their good; I have not learned much of the popular opinion about it; and I am not clear whether it would not be best for it to answer its self.</p><p>I do not believe I ever read a Pamphlet where there was as much spirit in it that was as <orig reg="entirely">intirely</orig> free of the spirit of candor, and truth.</p><p>If it were answered, I would wish to enquire at the <unclear>Mad,,</unclear> of the Synod; (as they are great sticklers for <orig reg="discipline">decipline</orig> ) How often <sic corr="an">an an</sic> offending Brother; or Presbytery, ought to be sighted, before a Synod, <abbr expan="Presbyterian">Presb</abbr> or Session; could adjudicate on their case And how often <name>Mcadow</name> , <name>King</name>, and yourself had been regularly summoned to appear, and before What <abbr expan="Preacher">P,,</abbr> They say that you, &amp; King never had any authority; if so, how did they know it?
