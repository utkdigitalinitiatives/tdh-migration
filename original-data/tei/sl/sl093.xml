The honest energetic man who is trying to pay his debts can <orig reg="always">allways</orig> get any reasonable indulgence at my hands  I seldom sue any person and hope I will not treat you worse than others. It is true if I trade with you, I may need part of the money for I may vest some in  land near me, Hence I say  to you if we trade I wish to make a trade by which we can both live &amp; prosper. I will therefore   expect you to pay me the price for my land, yet if it is not convenient for you to pay at the times stipulated you may expect any reasonable indulgence at my hands, your interest would be as good as any other mans. I of course will expect an early answer from you, <pb n="[3]"/> If    we do not trade I wish to improve this land for some of my family to live on, will you please give me your advice as to the propriety of having  timber deadened  what it will cost per acre, and when it ought to be done <abbr expan="et cetera, et cetera">&amp;c &amp;c</abbr></p><closer><salute>Yours Very Respectfully </salute><signed><emph><name type="person">A.
