In the letter, Harris claims that a George Calhoun wishes to have a dispute over land that Charles' brother Samuel Harris sold him in Williamson County, Tennessee. Samuel Harris sold Calhoun 350 acres of land that was a parcel of land that was made up of 1000 acres. Calhoun disputes the amount of land that was actually sold to him, and has not paid any of the expenses or taxes that have accrued to the land.</note><note type="collection">Coffee Perkins Papers</note><note type="box">1</note><note type="folder">13</note><note type="document">sl058</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker;

The bond was given to execute a deed of three hundred and fifty acres of land out of a <orig reg="specified">specifyed</orig> tract of one thousand acres of land viz from a tract of 1008 acres of land entered in <name type="person">John Armstrongs</name> office by said Harris <abbr expan="Number">No</abbr> 1804: I would  ask in this case admit that the whole of this 1000 acres had been covered by Older State grants how would Samuel Har <pb n="[3]"/> ris or his kin have made a little for any part of it or how could Mr <orig reg="Calhoun">Calhoon</orig> claiming by virtue of that bond compel the heirs of <name type="person">Samuel Harris</name> to do a thing which in its nature is morally impossible.</p><p>But this difficulty has been removed by the conduit of Mr <orig reg="Calhoun">Calhoon</orig> he has set up his claim for no more thanks proportionate share of the safe land &mdash;
