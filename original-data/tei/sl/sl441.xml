The democracy of this state however, will, in all sincerity and good faith, earnestly and zealously support the nominee of the national convention, whoever he may <add>be</add> ; but at the same time, Mr. Van Buren is well known to be the first choice of a very large majority of our democracy. This was plainly <add>and fully</add> indicated, by resolutions of preference, <del type="overstrike">expressed</del> <add>passed</add> almost unanimously by the people, in primary meeting, in <orig reg="nearly">narly</orig> all the counties and districts of the state, previous to the meeting of the convention in November <add>last</add> . In the language of a distinguished American historian, the democracy Tennessee, <del type="overstrike">received the defeat</del> believed, and yet believe, that in the defeat of Mr. Van Buren in 1840, the democratic <pb n="[2]"/> principle was defied, insulted, and trampled upon; and that that principle demands to avenge itself_ not as an affair of human passion or personal ambition. It is a movement from the higher sphere of truth and right; and it is the law of the moral world, that truth and right cannot with impunity be outraged. The Democratic principle, having for a time been overwhelmed by arts and misrepresentations, has gathered energy to throw off the weight that bore it down; it will rise once more in its majesty, to be the guiding light of our nation and the hope of humanity." Actuated by these deep and abiding sentiments, the democracy of our state, entertaining at the same time the highest confidence in the other distinguished citizens brought forward for the office, and willing to support any one of them who may be nominated, we need not assure you, that <del type="overstrike">we we and our democratic <orig reg="brethren">brethern</orig> would be desired the  greater gratification from the nomination of Mr Van Buren through Mr Van Buren is our first choice and his nomination now</del></p><p>though Mr. Van Buren is the first choice of the greater numbers of our democracy, yet either of his distinguished competitors for the nomination, will, if selected as the candidate of the party, receive the undivided and ardent support of <del type="overstrike">our party</del> the democratic party in Tennessee.</p><p>The undersigned beg leave, respectfully, to call your attention to the following resolution, <add>unanimously</add> passed by our convention, and incorporated in its <add>published</add> proceedings. The resolution regards the Vice Presidency, and the claims of our own distinguished fellow citizen, <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> <name>James K. Polk</name>. The resolution is as follows: <pb n="[3]"/></p></div1><div1 type="political address"><p>By the selection and nomination of Gov. Polk, whose claims are amply discussed in the accompanying Address, we believe, in perfect sincerity, and from a <add>fair</add> view of the whole ground that more strength would be brought to the democratic ticket, than by the selection of any <add>other</add> candidate who has been named by our friends in any division of the union. His friends in Tennessee, feel confident, that with his name on the <add>democratic</add> ticket, our beloved state would be redeemed in the contest from her present federal position; and we feel free to declare, that his friends in Tennessee, in urging his promotion to the second office in the government, his claims to which have been so faithfully and dearly earned, have not the slightest wish, desire, or anticipation of in any manner forestalling, or in any manner interfering with, the prospective claims of distinguished <orig reg="aspirants">asperants</orig> , and older men of our party, in any section of the union, in regard to their claims, prospects or rights in the Presidential election of 1848. We make this declaration fully impressed with <del type="overstrike ">the amp</del> its import, and in the spirit of sincerity and condone which becomes ourselves and the occasion.</p><p>We <add>in Tennessee</add> are the more earnest in pressing the claims of  Gov. Polk, because we believe, without his name on our ticket, that Tennessee may, and most probably will, continue to occupy her present unnatural and false political position. With <add>his</add> <del type="overstrike">Gov. Polks</del> name on our ticket, all our best talents will <del type="overstrike">deem</del> <add>take</add> the field, and the battle will be waged with a vigor and confidence of success which must result in certain victory.
