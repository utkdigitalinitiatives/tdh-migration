You say <name>Paris</name> is "<orig reg="melancholy">meloncholly</orig> dull" perhaps what I heard a gentleman observe not long ago is true, that all <name>Paris</name> was moved away and the town was sown down in oats, if it should ever be the case, the place where it once stood would always be hallowed ground to me, there is not a scene, or a street, nor an old house about the town, but what linked with <add>some</add> happy <orig reg="remembrance">rememberence</orig> of the past that cannot easily be forgotten.  I went down home in october but did not stay out at my Fathers but one night, they had the <abbr expan="whooping">hooping</abbr> cough among the negroes very bad and I was afraid for my children to take it so late in the year I went to Aunt <orig reg="Watson's">Watsons</orig> and <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> a few days and mama and the children come up and staid with me, I was very sorry I could not remain any longer I go so seldom but I could not stay with <pb n="[2]"/> Aunt Watson, you know her failing. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Watson has built an <orig reg="addition">adition</orig> to his house and finished it off very <orig reg="handsomely">hansomely</orig> with a nice portico in front, I did not know the place it was so much changed.   </p><p>I have not received a letter from home since I was there but I have heard by a gentleman that was at my Fathers about a month ago, he said they are building in town and expected to move very soon, he said mama told him that my Father had divided out his negroes among his children and that if I would come down there this spring she would give a maid, whether it be true or not I do not know. <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> Finiman myself and both my children are all very well, Laura can talk very plain and Junius is <orig reg="begging">beging</orig> to step about a little and is I think very fine smart looking fellow every body says he is just like you so you can judge of his beauty that You must come down soon and see us all yourself it has been nearly a year now since you were here.  give my best love to Susan and <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> Wooldrige and tell Susan I congratulate her on the birth of her son and sincerely hope that she may be fortunate enough to raise him give my love to every person that remembers me.  write soon and tell if you can when you expect to visit us.</p> <closer>Your Sister <signed>M.
