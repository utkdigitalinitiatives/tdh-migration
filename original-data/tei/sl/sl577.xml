Overton is writing about the tract of land that would later become Memphis, Tennessee at the hands of  Overton, Winchester, and General Andrew Jackson. In Overton's letter he is explaining who owns how much of the land then known as Chickasaw Bluff, including relatives of Winchester. He also gives suggestions about how to administer the property, and says that they should begin laying off the town as soon as possible.</note><note type="collection">James Winchester Papers</note><note type="box">1</note><note type="folder">9</note><note type="document">sl577</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee</item><item>Overton, John, 1766-1833</item><item>Real property</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener><p><name><abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Jackson</name> and myself purchas <gap/> the <name>chickasaw Bluff</name> track about the year 1796__ I have retained my part of it ever since.
