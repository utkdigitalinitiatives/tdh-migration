Surely they are a class of unfortunates that most justly claim our sympathy &amp; properly may demand protection &amp; support at the hands of an enlightened government. It would be alike creditable to your administration and to the Legislature of the state which ranks as fifth in the union in population, &amp; which falls behind none in sentiments of honor and justice that some provision be made for this purpose. If an institution cannot be established within the state for the blind, at least an appropriation might be authorized from the Treasury, to aid this unfortunate class in availing themselves of the benefits &amp; privileges of such institutions in neighboring states__</p>
