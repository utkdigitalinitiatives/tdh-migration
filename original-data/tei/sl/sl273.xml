John apologizes for not writing sooner, and that he can not blame it on being occupied with women. He writes that the night before was supposed to be the Second Coming according to Miller's doctrine. John does not believe in Miller. He also mentions that he does not support the temperance movement. He reports no success at getting a job for James, and that he has not heard from an uncle or Jane in some time.</note><note type="collection">Orr Collection IV-J-2</note><note type="box">5</note><note type="document">sl273</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Religious thought -- 19th century</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Shelbyville</name> <date value="1843-04-23">April 23rd 1843</date></addrLine></address><salute>My Dear Sam</salute></opener><p>I forget whether I wrote to you last or you to me. but am inclined to <orig reg="believe">beleive</orig> that the <unclear>sin</unclear> rests with myse &caret; <add place="supralinear">l</add> f (as I am very much given to the Commission of such) and if so, I claim your forgiveness or the grounds of my &blank;</p><p>I am at a loss for a suitable word to fill that space with, I cannot plead want of time in my extenuation for if there is any one thing that I have too much of, it is idle time for if I were a "Ladies Man" the <unclear>"Sex's</unclear> Idol" <abbr expan="and etcetera">&amp;c</abbr> I might plead attendance upon them as a very good reason for not writing sooner but this I cannot do without stretching the truth neither am I again attempting to court the muse nor, &mdash; being an alien &mdash; do I ever muddle with politicks or listen to <unclear>stump speeches</unclear> .
