The writers of the letter express regret that Winchester is investing in Tobacco cultivation, they tell him his prospects for profit are dim considering that currently there is a large supply and little demand.  Instead, they urge Winchester to consider Cotton as a wise investment in place of tobacco.  They also give him news of the sinking of the S.R. Tennessee in the Mississippi river above Natchez.</note><note type="collection">James Winchester Papers</note><note type="box">2</note><note type="folder">3</note><note type="document">sl496</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee -- History</item><item>Letters</item><item>Cotton</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="Letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine>New Orleans</addrLine></address> <date>19 <abbr expan="February">Feby</abbr> 1823</date>    <salute>General Winchester <abbr expan="dear">dr</abbr> Sir</salute></opener><p>The cash advances required of us shall be cheerfully made and in the way desired. </p><p>We seriously regret to hear that you are again dealing in the article of Tobacco,  because  it has long been a loosing business to those who <gap reason="Document is torn"/> been engaged in the <orig reg="traffic">traffick</orig>, and now presents a more gloomy prospect than it had even yet done within our recollection__ The stock on hand abroad is unusually larger__ the demand small indeed and rates wonderfully <unclear>reduced</unclear>__ here there is remaining of the old crop, fully three thousand hogsheads, the new crop arriving, the price at least one cent <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> pound larger than it was last year at this time, and no possibility of selling readily <unclear>even</unclear> at low prices and on very extensive credits.</p><p>Cotton affords some inducement to the investors of funds and we recommend it to your consideration exclusively__ it is in command of 9<abbr expan="cents">C</abbr> 91/2 for <name>Tennessee</name>      <pb n="[2]"/> and <name>alabama</name>, with on return demand and in cash payments__.
