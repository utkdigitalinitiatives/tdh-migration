Should the apprehended  combination of most of the different tribes of Indians invited take place, I shall need for the <orig reg="defense">defence</orig> of the western  frontier from three thousand to five thousand men from your state. And I shall hold myself in honor and in duty bound to make every requisite provision for their health and comfort preparatory to meeting the enemy, ___ and above all to afford them every proper opportunity to sustain the chivalry of their state ___ and to take care of the sick &amp; wounded I am with very great respect.</p><closer><salute>Your Excellency's most obedient <abbr expan="servant">st</abbr></salute><signed><name>Edmund P.
