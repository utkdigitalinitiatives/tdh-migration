For the sum of $6000. Specie, we have purchased a farm consisting of 450 acres of Good land, 180 of which are in cultivation, on which are an elegant framed house, two hewed log houses, with other out houses, affording conveniences for the residence of private families, a horse mill, a cotton gin, 600 fine apple trees and an excellent spring of never failing water. A few friends have been so kind as to unite with us, in borrowing money to make the first payment.</p><p>Two <orig reg="annual">anual</orig> payments are still due, for which we and our friends are bound. All the subscriptions we have received are payable in one, two and three years, but  <gap/> least three <orig reg="fourths">forths</orig> of them are payable in land or property, such as cannot be converted in to cash without a Great Sacrifice; and <orig reg="consequently">consiquently</orig> will not aid us much in paying the purchase we have made. we have now to procure horses, stock, farming utensils, furniture for the boarding house, and provisions for the present year, together with some necessary buildings, which will require ready cash. Brother, we have launched our bark on the ocean of experiment. we must weather the storm. "We must not lie on our oars; but tug for our lives", until we reach the desired haven. But after all we must eventually sink without assistance. Some of our oldest, most-experienced and influential Preachers, must reach forth a helping hand, in  this our time of extreme necessity; and spend their time, between this and the  commencement of the camp meeting season, in riding and collecting funds. Strong exertions must be made. <pb n="[2]"/> unless we do receive a prompt and vigorous support from our <orig reg="Brethren">Breatheren</orig> abroad, our college, and the credit of our body must inevitably sink in the view of the world. Other Sectaries are even now waiting our downfall, and anticipating their own triumph. But where are the men to spend three or four months in soliciting donations? where ever the friends of science, religion and humanity are to be found. "There art the man", or at least one of them. So we most ardently hope, and confidently believe you will, to aid me, and support so Good a cause, to accomplish so valuable an object. you will sacrifice some of your worldly interest, it is true; but the interest of the church are far dearer and we trust you will not hesitate. other in this section have made much Greater sacrifices, than any expected of you. Could you Know our situation and behold our difficulties, it would be enough: you would want no other excitement. For the sake of that Glorious cause, so dear to us all, aid us by your prompt exertions, your prayers to God, and your solicitations among men. we shall commence all the business of the Institution, on the <date>first of march</date> next. we shall expect the people in your presbytery, to send on their students as soon as possible, with their money in their hands, according to an article in the Constitution, requiring payment half yearly in advance. The whole <orig reg="expense">expence</orig> will not be less than $60. during the first year. Every student must bring with him, a Blanket, a pair of sheets, a Towel, and either a bed tick, or bed cover. all may be of a course, but durable quality. At all events, an arrangement must be made at each of the presbyteries at their spring session, for immediately sending on their candidates, and as many others a they can, as <pb n="[3]"/> the farming arrangements will render it indispensably necessary. We are decidedly of the opinion, that (besides your own donation, which you will bring up to the next Synod) you, by your individual exertions, can <orig reg="very">verry</orig> conveniently obtain, at least, $200.00, which you will send to the <orig reg="Treasurer">Treasuerer</orig> of the Cumberland Presbyterian College, by the <date>first of June</date>, or as soon as you can by a safe <orig reg="opportunity">oppertunity</orig> .___</p><closer><salute>Your Breatheren in the Lord</salute><signed><name><abbr expan="Franceway Ranna"> F.
