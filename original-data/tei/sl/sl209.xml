All persons when grown up to the age of maturity regret that they did not devote more of their time to study. Therefore it is eventually requisite that we should study <orig reg="while">whyle</orig> we have an opportunity and whyle we are at it we should not only study the <orig reg="contents">contense</orig> of school books, but we should <del type="overstirke">we</del> connect virtue with it and make that the principle part of our <orig reg="studies">studys</orig> for unless virtue is well studied and fully practiced, we are apt to be led astray; for you know the many vices and evils connected with the habit and dispositions of the &caret; <add place="supralinear">youth</add> of the <orig reg="present">pressent</orig> age that it is almost impossible to escape.</p><p>But virtue ever simple and credulous; conscious of new designs of itself it <unclear>suspits</unclear> none in others; it wears no guards before its breast; <orig reg="every">evry</orig> door and portal and avenue of the heart is thrown open and all who choose it enter. One of the most vicious and poisonous &caret; <add place="supralinear">enemies to virtue</add> and one whose fang enters deeper in the heart than any other, is the craving appetite <del type="overstrike">for</del> for wealth: and we too frequently &caret; <add place="supralinear">stop to</add> look upon the many splendid objects which it presents to our mind; and then it is that we are allured from the path <sic corr="of">of of</sic> virtue, into the dark and <orig reg="merciless">mercyless</orig> ways of vice, without one bright <del type="overstrike">ry</del> ray of hope to cheer us on our way.
