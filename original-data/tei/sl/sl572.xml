I now avail myself of the <abbr expan="opportunity">oppty</abbr> to inform you, that the explanations given in that letter, respecting my son__  is satisfactory.  and I repeat my wish for him to continue in your service.  We hear that about 1200 <orig reg="Volunteers">Volunters</orig> appeared at <name>Fayettville</name>, for the purpose of proceeding to the south.
