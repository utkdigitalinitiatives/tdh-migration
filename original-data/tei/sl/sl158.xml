you have not told me in any of your letters, how you are situated, or where you board, neither have you said, one word, about my Brother, <name type="person">Frank</name>; whether he has <orig reg="commenced">commeced</orig> business and what his prospects are, or whether he has entered <orig reg="into">in to</orig> a partnership, We have had so many distressing Occurrences since I wrote you last that I hardly know where to begin, in the first place, <name type="person">Maria Price</name>, when returning from <name type="person">Mr.  Bradford</name>s, fell from her horse and broke her collar bone, I got her to Town the <pb n="[2]"/> same day and had it set, but she has been quite indisposed since, not long after that our dear friend, and good <orig reg="physician">physition</orig> <name type="person">Dr. Erving</name>, was taken &caret;

thank God our lives are spared; Of late we have had a <orig reg="pest">peste</orig> in the creek that has swept up all our fences  that was in its reach, there never has been any thing like it since we have lived here before <name type="person">Mr. Little</name> is in great distress about it and thinks he has lost an hundred <orig reg="panel">pannell</orig> of fence, he is very attentive good man, too good to the negroes, for he often lets them all go off and <orig reg="does">dose</orig> the work himself, <name type="person">Lewis</name> he cannot do any thing with he is, outlawed if the President had got to <name type="place">Nashville</name> I should <pb n="[3]"/> have changed <unclear></unclear> for one of the other bags with a hope, that he might never come back, I can see no reason why such a <orig reg="villain">villian</orig> should be kept on the place or ever in the country, my garden is coming on but poorly, the heavy rain has almost washed away those, <unclear>cacked bats</unclear> , and other curiosities, that were made <unclear>then</unclear> but they may all go. if I can only live to see you once more, <name type="person">Miss Martha</name> is with me at present her health I think is something better than when you left home; I hope you will make yourself perfectly easy, on my account as I enjoy my usual health since I wrote you last, do not trouble yourself to look for a cordial, stand as I do not care for any without I could have had the one I saw;
