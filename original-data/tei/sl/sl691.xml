			 <note type="summary">This document is a brief letter dated June 1, 1828, from L.T. Greenfield to the governor of Tennessee, Sam Houston.  The subject of the letter is a slave, owned by Greenfield, who had recently been convicted of breaking into a store near Williamsburg, Virginia, and sentenced to be hung.  Greenfield believes that much of the testimony against his slave in the trial was coerced, and asks Houston if he may send his slave out of state.</note>
