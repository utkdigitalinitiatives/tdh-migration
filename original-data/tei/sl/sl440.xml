Miller to John Overton, dated January 27, 1822. Miller gives a list of several topics that he wants Overton to consider. He wonders if there is someone other than Andrew Jackson to run for governor of Tennessee. Miller intimates that Jackson may be groomed for President if elected governor. He mentions the penitentiary house and that another may be built if needed. Miller writes about the question of slavery's effect on the presidential election. He thinks there will be  many candidates running for president.</note><note type="collection">Overton Papers</note><note type="box">Correspondence</note><note type="folder">12</note><note type="document">sl440</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee</item><item>Local government</item><item>Slavery Political aspects United States History 19th century</item><item>Presidential elections</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name>Knoxville</name> <date>January 17th 1822</date></addrLine></address><salute><abbr expan="Dear">D</abbr> Sir</salute></opener><p>the following <del type="overstrike">[unclear]</del> considerations are offered, 1st is there any man whose personal popularity is so likely to assist in <unclear>fixing</unclear> the seat  of government permanently at any given point as <name>Andrew Jackson</name>, if so why should he not be our next governor, or why should this not be wished <add>for</add> by those who desire this result___</p><p>I am satisfied that this cannot be done with the present legislature.
