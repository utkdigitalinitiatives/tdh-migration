She writes that the cholera is starting to subside in town, and who has died from it. She reports of a cousin who is badly sick, whom she wants to accompany herself, George and their daughter on a trip. She tells George that she never wants him to travel again, and to that end, she wants him to stay gone on this trip until he is completely finished, no matter how long it takes. Their daughter Sallie adds a few lines.</note><note type="collection">Orr Collection IV-J-2</note><note type="box">3</note><note type="folder">11</note><note type="document">sl264</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Communications in the family</item><item>Cholera</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Nashville</name> <date value="1850-07-06">July 16th 1850</date></addrLine></address><salute>My own dear George</salute></opener><p>Since I wrote to you last; (which was a week ago, to <name type="place">Cahawba</name>) I have received two very affectionate, (and need I say) welcome, and much prized letters from you; It thrills my heart with sincere pleasure to hear, as it were from your own lips &mdash; that you love me so fondly still, and I will do as you tell me " <unclear>meaning</unclear> your love for me, by my own".</p><p>It gives me great pleasure to say that the Cholera is fast subsiding; There are now but few cases from day to day; not more than from three to six, or eight deaths in twenty four hours I went down town this morning for the first time in two weeks, and I assure you things look much more cheerful than they did then, notwithstanding I met with a good many pale, anxious faces; <name type="person">Mr Moses</name>, your next door neighbor, has lost a son, and a daughter from cholera; and I believe the whole family have had it more or less &mdash; I suppose <name type="person">Mr McClelland</name> has given you an account of his wifes attack which was a very severe one; his family are all well now <pb n="[2]"/> Our friends the "Browns" are with us yet <name type="person">Mr Brown</name> has been more alarmed about cholera than any one I have ever seen; he has stayed at home constantly during the time it raged so badly, and some of the time he did not come down stairs to <orig reg="his">hi</orig> meals; and he scarcely eat any thing at all &mdash; cousin L, had last week, a severe hemorrhage, and <name type="person">Dr Ford</name> says it was from her lungs &mdash; she does not complain much, of feeling unwell, but looks very badly and is <orig reg="extremely">extreamly</orig> anxious to take a trip some <orig reg="where">whare</orig> &mdash; but it is hard to move <name type="person">Mr Brown</name> to do any thing, or go any whare &mdash; they have been talking for four weeks past, of going to <name type="place">Kingston</name> and have not gone yet &mdash; and cousin L says there is no knowing wheather they will go at all, I proposed yesterday (if she did not get off somewhare before) to go with you <del type="overstrike">and</del> Sallie and myself to the Cave, when you return; she says that trip would suit her exactly &mdash; <name type="person">Mr McIntosh</name> says he is bound to go some whare, that he may eat corn and cucumbers, and not be <orig reg="afraid">affraid </orig>of getting sick, he says it wont do to eat them here &mdash; In the last two weeks Aunt Silvey and Jim have both died, but neither of cholera; Jim tried to cut <pb n="[3]"/> his throat, or rather did cut it, two or three weeks before he died, but that did not kill him.
