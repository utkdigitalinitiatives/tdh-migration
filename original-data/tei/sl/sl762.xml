			 <note type="summary">This document is a letter dated September 28, 1819 from James Park to the governor of Tennessee, Joseph McMinn.  The subject of the letter is the wretched condition of the Turnpike road between Knoxville and Sparta, and the growing difficulty that United States mail wagon carriers have in its passage.  In the letter, Park writes of mail routes throughout Tennessee.  He also asks the governor to consider whether or not a toll should be authorized on the Turnpike.</note>
