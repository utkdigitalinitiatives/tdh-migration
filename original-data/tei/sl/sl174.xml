The last summer was very dry in this country &amp; corn crops were not generally good but the late rains made generally very good crops of cotton. The last winter was the severest that I have seen in this country &amp; the  early part of spring very wet &amp; we are now suffering for the want of <del type="overstrike">the</del> rain. I have nothing to say on political subjects only that our State does not go with <name type="person">South Carolina</name> in its nullifying policy; although most of our Citizens think the tariff of the <name type="person">United States</name> is oppression in the Southern section of the Union, but they still think it a small evil compared to civil war with its accompanying horrors. Please give our most affectionate respects to my aged Mother, <orig reg="Brother">Brothir</orig> &amp; <orig reg="Sister">Sistir</orig> Anderson &amp; accept them for yourself &amp; family, remember us affectionately to <name type="person">Aunt Duffill</name> and all our relatives in your section of country. Please to write as often as convenient you know the difficulty that I <orig reg="labor">labour</orig> under in writing from my hand being crippled, but you could write frequently.</p><closer><salute>I remain with respect your affectionate brother</salute><signed><name type="person"><abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Brown</name></signed></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
