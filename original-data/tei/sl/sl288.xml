Donelson writes that he was upset by a false report that Andrew Jr.  had been killed by Indians. Donelson has just returned from Germany, where he was serving as ambassador, and reports that his home and financial situation are better than he had hoped. He writes that he is worried about Andrew Jr. and that he is going to speak to a colonel about some vacation time for his son. Donelson hopes that being in danger will make Andrew Jr. a better man but  regrets that he has chosen a dangerous career.</note><note type="collection">A. J.

As I passed <orig reg="through">thro</orig> <name>Washington</name> I examined your reports to the Engineer office where I heard for the first time of the report which  had circulated a few weeks that you had been killed by the Indians. You cannot conceive what painful thoughts this report created, even when I knew that it was unfounded. It leaves still the apprehension that you are in danger, and that your safety depends on a great degree of personal firmness and vigilance. These qualities you possess, but above all <pb n="[2]"/> you have learned to rely on the protection of a kind Providence which is a better <orig reg="shield">sheild</orig> than can be supplied by human means.</p><p>At the date of your letter you had not learned of my departure with all the family from <name><orig reg="Frankfurt">Frankfort</orig></name>. we sailed from <name>Southampton</name> on the <date>15th Nov.</date>  in the steam ship Hermann, and reached home in good health on the <date>10th <abbr expan="January">Jany</abbr></date>. I found my house much <orig reg="dilapidated">delapidated</orig>, but the farm in better condition than I expected . The negroes were in good health. Looking at my debts and means to pay them my condition is not so bad as I had anticipated. I have reason to <orig reg="believe">beleive</orig> that I can discharge all <pb n="[3]"/> my obligations without any sale of property should the price of cotton continue good for two years. I go in a few days to <name>Mississippi</name> for the purpose of arranging my affairs there and making another crop <del type="overstrike">there</del> .</p><p>The source of greatest <orig reg="uneasiness">uneaseness</orig> to us all is your <orig reg="separation">seperation</orig> on to <unclear></unclear> and distant a frontier. I told <name><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> <unclear>Cotten</unclear></name> that it was too great a sacrifice and that he must <orig reg="receive">releive</orig> you. My hope is that early in the spring you will be allowed to visit us.</p><p>My time has been occupied in refurnishing my house. when this is done John will be sent to the college at Nashville and Rachel to the female Academy. your Ma will be confined again in a few days. <pb n="[4]"/> I have not yet visited our relations in the neighborhood, but have seen them all. They are well and enquire affectionately after you.</p><p>I cannot think, my dear Son, of the dangers which surround you without feeling that I am somewhat to blame for you entering upon a career <del type="overstrike">which</del> thus exposed . But it is too late to remedy the evil, in any other way than to meet it manfully. If you live through it, as I pray to God that you may; it may be the means of future good. May it strengthen your constitution and enable you to return with you mind and heart made wiser and better by danger, and better qualified to serve your country &amp; friends.</p><p>All of us join in love &amp; prayers for you preservation</p><closer><salute><abbr expan="Your affectionate">Yr. aff</abbr> Father</salute><signed><name><abbr expan="Andrew Jackson">A J</abbr> Donelson</name></signed></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
