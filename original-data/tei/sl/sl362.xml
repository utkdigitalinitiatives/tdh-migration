I leave you to judge what my <unclear>perplexities</unclear> must be.  Did the Church by a rigorous exertion collect and pay me one half what is owing me by her members I could  come out triumphantly, but on this subject there is little hope and being convinced that the longer I go on as I have done the  <unclear>worse</unclear> it will be I shall have to stop.  I think I can sell out my printing office so as to pay what I owe and then the world is before  me though it is a hard matter to take for the benefit of brethren for years and then be ruined by them and have to begin anew with a large and very <pb n="[3]"/> <orig reg="helpless">hepless</orig> family.
