It will probably be two weeks before <add>I</add> finally leave the vicinity of McMinnville, and it will require three or four weeks more to cross the Mountains.</p><p>There has been some sickness in the party for a week or two past, owing chiefly to our exposure to the weather, which has been very <orig reg="unfavorable">unfavourable</orig>.
