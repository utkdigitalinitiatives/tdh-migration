Temple says in the letter that although the area of Tennessee that he lives in has a good crop of corn and grain, times are hard financially on everyone and that he will have to sell some of his land. Temple inquires as to whether Abernathy would be interested in purchasing some of his land. Temple also mentions the speeches given by Martin Van Buren and that the public in Greene County are good people.</note><note type="collection">Abernathy Papers</note><note type="box">II-H-3</note><note type="folder">13</note><note type="document">sl096</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Real property</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Greene County <abbr expan="Tennessee">Ten</abbr></name></addrLine><addrLine><date value="1841-06-09">June 9th 1841</date></addrLine></address><salute><orig reg="Dear">Der</orig> Sir</salute></opener><p>I <abbr expan="Received">Rec'd</abbr> yours of the <date value="0000-10-14">14 of Oct</date> by a due course of mail it found myself &amp; family in usu <add place="supralinear">al</add> good health; &amp; By the Blessings of providence we are permitted still to enjoying good health.
