		  <opener><address><addrLine><name>Philadelphia</name> <date>18th April 1796</date></addrLine></address><salute>Dear General,</salute></opener><p>I hope I may safely by this time salute you as Governor of the State of <name>Tennessee</name>; or of the Territory of the <name>united states</name><abbr expan="South"> So</abbr> of <name>Ohio</name>. I congratulate you, in either case. For, if the united states should be of opinion that a census taken without their concurrence should be invalid; yet I have a strong confidence that you will be commissioned, &amp; paid as an officer of the United States: at least, your friends, here, will push it in your favor; &amp; I make no doubt will succeed. They have been looking for the latter case, because it is perceivable that it is a matter of some doubt whether for fear, of the precedent, it may not be policy in this Government to have some share in the census. For my own part I think it a great point for us that the Governor of our Territory should be a man who is decidedly the choice of the people. I mention <gap/> thing in confidence to you as something questionable: <gap/> I rather hope, <unclear>&amp;</unclear> expect that <unclear>our</unclear> Government <add>of Tennessee</add> will be allowed to proceed on the plan established by our convention: particularly as the committee appointed to consider on the case, in the House of Representatives have made a favorable report. The Senate, have also appointed a Committee for the consideration of the same subject; but the latter, I am told, will be clear that a census in which Congress had no share ought not to be looked upon as valid. The question will be taken up in the course of the work, &amp; as soon as decided shall be sent you, for your information. I thought it an act of friendship to inform You of the true state of the business; but as I have no certain grounds on which to found an opinion, I wish this loose surmise to be to yourself in Confidence <add><unclear>Mero</unclear></add><pb n="[2]"/> There is nothing new, here. The appropriations for the treaty with <name><abbr expan="Great">G.</abbr> Britain</name> have not yet been made: but some of my acquaintance who were very adverse to that Treaty are coming to. As it regards us, I do not see why we should wish to see the executive of government disturbed on this score. I am therefore glad that the people of our Territory have not been forward in joining the general clamor, on that score. But our friend Parker, for whom we both entertain so much esteem, is bitterly opposed to it. So indeed are all the <name>Virginia</name> Representatives.</p>
