			 <note type="summary">This document is a letter dated April 22, 1845 from the governor of Tennessee, James Jones to the sheriff of Washington County, located in Northeast Tennessee.  The purpose of the letter is to urge the sheriff to fulfill his duty, and obligation by carrying out the  warrant issued   for the arrest of William Bales, Nathaniel Brown,  John Block, and Arless Collins, charged with highway robbery in North Carolina.  In the letter, the governor says he is aware of a   strong "feeling and excitement" created in  Washington county by the case, however, it is not up to him, or the sheriff to pass judgement.  </note>
