		  <opener><address><addrLine>Knoxville</addrLine></address>  <date>21st February 1805</date><salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener><p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 15th <abbr expan="ultimo">ult</abbr> and have carefully examined the <del>same</del>  contents.  With respect to the laws of the <name>United States</name> touching indian affairs I make no doubt you are as well acquainted with them as myself and also the treaties that have been made with the cherokee indians.  If the persons have conducted in the manner you have been pleased to describe, I know of no law prohibiting such a conduct, nor do I believe that the General Government would ever notice or <unclear>disapprobate</unclear> such a measure, and as to my own part I am inclined to think it a <orig reg="humane">humain</orig> and benevolent act, and such a one I make no doubt has rendered many poor and distressed individuals much comfort and relief; but my friend experience has taught you as well as myself, that few, and too few, pay any regard to the Sufferings of their fellow creatures.  Permit me to <pb n="[2]"/> to advise your friends how necessary it is to be cautious and not expose themselves to any liability of the law, for if they do you may be assured there is always persons to be found mean enough to distress them; In a country like yours the first adventures are not of the richest class of Citizens and if they should be dragged off to nashville before a tribunal that perhaps would not have much lenity for their conditions, they might suffer greatly were they evenly not found guilty of any <orig reg="trespass">trespas</orig>.  You know lawyers and other court Officers will have their fees.  I throw out these <unclear>hints</unclear> , as it is my wish your <orig reg="neighbors">neighbours</orig> may not involve themselves, but be cautiously guarded against the dangers of expensive law suits.  With respect to furnishing provisions on the road it is my opinion that all that could be carried would not be sufficient together with the supplies furnished by the keepers of the Stands, and I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> see why there should be any discontent on the Subject.  The indians attend the road constantly, is it  not as free for the passage of the whites?  or are the indians entitled to greater privileges? </p>
