Moore to his cousin J.M. King.  Moore acknowledges the letter is long overdue, but writes that he and his family are well, except fear of being inflicted with cholera that has plagued many in New Orleans.  He says the victims of the disease are greater than the number of available coffins, and that many bodies were thrown into the Mississippi river.</note><note type="collection">James Moore King Papers Correspondence 1832</note><note type="box">1</note><note type="folder">9</note><note type="document">gc018</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 3.0 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Cholera</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="Letter"><pb n="[1]"/>  <opener><address><addrLine><add cert="different hand, ink">From <name type="person"><abbr expan="Thomas O.">T.O</abbr>.
