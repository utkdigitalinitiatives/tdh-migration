    <description.1>This is a copy of the official opinion of the Supreme Court of the U.S., delivered by Chief Justice John Marshall, on the motion filed by the Cherokee Nation for an injunction against the state of Georgia. The Cherokees sought the opinion of the court on the issue of Georgia's right to extend its jurisdiction over the Cherokee Nation, effectively depriving them of their sovereignty. Marshall's decision here indicates that the Cherokees cannot be strictly considered foreign nations, as they had argued, and are instead considered "wards of the state," or "domestic dependents." This decision was delivered in the January term of 1831 and is of extreme significance in the development of Indian Removal issues.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a general order from Brigadier General John E. Wool, at army headquarters at Fort Cass, (Tennessee), dated November 3, 1836. The order contains directions from the President respecting the implementation of the Treaty of New Echota (signed 1835, ratified 1836), which provided for the removal of the Cherokee Indians to a territory west of the Mississippi River. Wool indicates that soldiers stationed in the Cherokee Nation are to prohibit any meetings of the Cherokee people for the purpose of opposing the removal treaty. In addition, it is stated that no delegation from the Cherokee Nation interested in renegotiating the terms of the treaty will be acknowledged.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from John Martin and John Ridge, Cherokee leaders in Washington, to John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, dated December 28, 1831. Martin and Ridge report to Ross on the progress of the Cherokee delegation in Washington and their decision to delay the delivery of the Cherokee Memorial to Congress. They indicate that they have news of atrocities against the Cherokees in Georgia. They further inform Ross that Elias Boudinot and John Ridge have met with Henry Clay who has pledged his support. They lament the hypocrisy with which they are met in dealing with the U.S. government. In addition, Martin and Ridge make reference to a delegation of Creek leaders also in Washington and comment on William Wirt's involvement in the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter from a delegation of Cherokee leaders, including John Ross, Elijah Hicks, George Lowrey, and Major Ridge, to Colonel Thomas L. McKenney, of the Department of War, dated April 29, 1824. The delegation communicates a number of issues to McKenney from Principal Chiefs Charles R. Hicks and Path Killer. The bulk of the letter relates to the misconduct and abusive behavior of Joseph McMinn, U.S. agent to the Cherokees, and former Governor of Tennessee (1815-1821). In particular, McMinn had allowed unauthorized whites to settle in the Cherokee Nation, in violation of numerous treaties, and refused to prosecute them when they committed depredations within the Nation. They also discuss payment for improvements and claims under the treaties of 1817 and 1819, and the boundary line along the Unicoi Turnpike.</description.1>

Porter, Secretary of War (1828-1829), dated January 29, 1829.

In addition, they also discuss lingering questions regarding the continuing education of Cherokee children and the unauthorized payment of a portion of the Cherokee annuity to Cherokees in Arkansas.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from a delegation of Cherokee leaders, including John Ross, William Hicks, George Lowrey, and Major Ridge, to William Carroll, Governor of Tennessee (1821-1827,1829-1835), dated August 29, 1829. The Cherokees express their unwillingness to convene a meeting with commissioners for the purpose of hearing proposals regarding removal to a territory west of the Mississippi River. They indicate that they have already informed the President and the Governor that they do not intend to sell more land now or in the future and convening a meeting for that purpose would be pointless.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter from Principal Chief John Ross to David Irwin and Thomas G. Barron, lawyers retained by the Cherokee Nation to pursue their claims against the state of Georgia, dated October 3, 1830. Ross indicates that the Cherokee people have rejected a recent treaty proposed by John F. Schermerhorn, regarding it as unjust and oppressive. They intend to press their arguments further and express good faith in their legal representation. Ross writes that he still has faith in the magnanimity of the U.S. government and maintains hope that removal can be avoided.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a copy of a letter from a delegation of Cherokee leaders, including John Ross, Elijah Hicks, and White Path, among others, to President Martin Van Buren (1837-1841), dated April 13, 1838. The delegation complains to the President that their communications in Washington were unfairly curtailed before they truly began, and the news of this occurrence has caused considerable distress in the Cherokee Nation. They prepared a Memorial to be delivered to Congress in response, and it was signed by over fifteen thousand people. The Memorial is no longer attached.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter from John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, to Colonel William Y. Hansell and Colonel Samuel Rockwell, lawyers for the Cherokee Nation, dated July 9, 1835. Ross complains to the two attorneys regarding the controversy of the payment of the Cherokee annuity. A vote is to be held under the direction of Major Benjamin F. Currey to determine to which Cherokee faction, the Ridge party or the Ross party, the annuity is to be paid. Ross complains about slanderous depictions of him in local newspapers and also mentions the arrival of Reverend John F. Schermerhorn to submit treaty proposals to the Cherokees.</description.1>

    <description.1>Letter dated February 18, 1837 from (Lewis Ross ?) to his brother (John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation ?) relating recent events in the Cherokee Nation. He informs his brother of an election that took place in New Echota concerning the distribution of annuity payments from the United States to the Cherokees. A large group of people crossed on ferry to take part in the election and chose George Lowrey, Cherokee leader, to receive the funds. (Lewis Ross ?) suspects that the true amount due the Nation is more than was reported and asks his brother to check on this. During the time of the election General John E. Wool gave a speech translated by Jesse Bushyhead, a Cherokee interpreter, explaining the terms of the recent treaty (Treaty of New Echota, 1835), advising the people to prepare to remove, and offering to supply certain provisions. (Ross ?) also reports that men who were accused of attacking an officer were whipped, and Bridge Maker and Tom Foreman were arrested for speaking out against the treaty. He says that emigrants have been passing through and there is much sickness.</description.1>

    <description.1>Letter dated June 10, 1831 from Samuel A. Worcester, Christian missionary living in the Cherokee Nation, to Georgia Governor George R. Gilmer in response to a letter Worcester received from Gilmer. Worcester received the letter by Gilmer through Colonel Sanford and is informed by Sanford that he is liable to arrest if he has not removed within ten days. Worcester defends himself against accusations made by the governor, contending that his goal is to stimulate the spiritual growth of the Cherokee people and not to revolt politically against the state. He explains why he cannot in good conscience take the oath of Georgia and describes his progress in translating Christian texts into Cherokee. Worcester is determined to remain with the Cherokee until he is forced to move. Elias Boudinot, editor of the "Cherokee Phoenix" newspaper is mentioned.</description.1>

    <description.1>Letter dated June 7, 1831 from Elizur Butler, Christian missionary living in the Cherokee Nation, to Georgia Governor George R. Gilmer in response to a letter Butler received from Gilmer. Butler explains his purposes in living within the Cherokee Nation. He says that he arrived ten years ago to assist the United States in its policy to "civilize" and Christianize the Cherokees, and his only concern is the spiritual growth of the Cherokees and not political issues. He indicates that he cannot in good conscience take the oath of Georgia since it would imply that the state has jurisdiction over the Cherokee Nation.</description.1>

    <description.1>Cherokee Council minutes from May 20 to May 27, 1818 wherein several issues related to a recent treaty (Treaty of the Cherokee Agency, July 8, 1817) are discussed. The Cherokees request provisions such as guns, blankets, and kettles that were promised to them in the treaty, and there is a discussion about the census that is planned for June. An address made by the president to General Talentisky (Talohtiske ?) and others of the Arkansas Delegation to Washington concerning Cherokee removal and land in Arkansas is read to the Council. Also, a question and answer session regarding the recent treaty and specifically concerning reservations is held, wherein Cherokee leaders Walter Adair and Thomas Foreman raise issues.</description.1>

    <description.1>Cherokee Council minutes which include a talk from Joseph McMinn, Governor of Tennessee dated May 1818. McMinn presents the Treaty of the Cherokee Agency, July 8, 1817, before the Cherokee and Arkansas, and he discusses the federal government's plan for the removal of Indian Nations east of the Mississippi and the "civilization" of these people. The council minutes following McMinn's address appear to be in a different hand, but seem connected contextually.</description.1>

    <description.1>Copy of a treaty form for negotiations between the Cherokee Nation and the United States. The treaty pertains to the removal of the Cherokees east of the Mississippi River. The treaty articles listed detail payment for land, improvements, and loss of crops and release of Cherokees who have been seized, as well as the logistics of emigrating. The date 1838 which appears on the treaty form is dubious in light of historical record.</description.1>

    <description.1>Letter dated April 25, 1823 from the Cherokee Council to (U.S. Commissioners Duncan G. Campbell and James Meriwether ?) in response to a communication from these commissioners. The Council considers the commissioners' plea to repeal a resolution which disallows further land cession so that the commissioners can meet with the Council in Taloney and proceed with further negotiations. The Council responds in the negative, stating that the resolution was made to promote the interest and happiness of the Cherokee people and that no meeting will take place in Taloney because the seat of government is in New Town. A lengthy extract from the commissioners' letter follows which sets out arguments for the Cherokees to agree to further land cessions and remove west.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter or talk delivered to the General Council of the Cherokee Nation, by U.S. treaty commissioners Duncan G. Campbell and James Meriwether, and dated October 21, 1823. The commissioners patronizingly explain the relationship between the United States government and the Cherokee people and attempt to rationalize the continued efforts to acquire Cherokee lands. They insist that it is unfair that the Cherokees possess more land than they can physically occupy and thereby attempt to justify the intrusions of overzealous frontier settlers.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a talk from U.S. treaty commissioners Duncan G. Campbell and James Meriwether to the General Council of the Cherokee Nation, dated October 25, 1823. Campbell and Meriwether respond to the Cherokees rejection of their proposals on negotiating further land cessions. They condescendingly remind the Cherokees that they are mere occupants of the soil and warn them that they are unfairly accusing the states of Georgia and Tennessee of wrongdoing.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a talk from the General Council of the Cherokee Nation to U.S. treaty commissioners Duncan G. Campbell and James Meriwether, dated October 27, 1823. The Council rebuts a number of unfounded accusations made by the commissioners in a recent talk they delivered. The Cherokee Council explains that they have no more land to sell and thus, negotiating a treaty for further land cessions would be useless. They refer to the Treaty of Holston and numerous other treaties in developing their argument. The talk is signed by a number of important Cherokee leaders including Pathkiller, Major Ridge, and John Ross.</description.1>

    <description.0>Letter with sworn statement dated April 3, 1834 from John Smith in the Aquohee District to the (Cherokee ?) Delegation, concerning a property dispute. A portion of the property that Smith claims as his own was awarded to a man named Hosea Morgan, a recent emigrant to the Arkansas who claims to be Catawba, and Smith believes that Morgan has no right to this property since he is not a citizen of the nation nor Cherokee. He has presented his case to Major Curry, but has received no satisfaction and is now petitioning the delegation.</description.0>

One hundred and seven are life only reservations and 39 are fee simple. The 23 reservations that exist within the bounds of Georgia have been purchased for that state through a provision of Congress.</description.1>

    <description.1>This photograph is of an Overhill Cherokee pit containing the skeletal remains of a dog. Chota or Echota was an Overhill Cherokee village located in what is today Monroe County, Tennessee. In the mid-18th century, Chota was recognized by Europeans as well as other Indians for its powerful socio-economic influence and was regarded as the capital of the Cherokee Nation. Chota, as with all the Overhill Cherokee sites, is now inundated by the Tellico Reservoir. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal Investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J. Worth Greene.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a drawing of an Overhill Cherokee winter townhouse at Chota. Winter townhouses which were cone-shaped appeared to look like small mountains from a distance. Some were large enough to hold 500 people. The seats were arranged like an amphitheater with the seats rising one above another, leaving an area in the center for a fire. The drawing is based on historical descriptions as well as archaeological excavations conducted by The University of Tennessee from 1969-1974. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Directors, J. Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F. Schroedl. The drawing is by Thomas Whyte.</description.1>

    <description.1>This photograph is of the Fort Marr Blockhouse located at Benton in Polk County, Tennessee. Fort Marr, also known as 'The Old Fort,' was constructed around 1814 near Old Fort, Tennessee. The fort was positioned along the Old Federal Road and housed troops who were assigned to protect white travelers using the road and the Cherokees from Creek retaliation. The fort was also said to have been used to safeguard supplies and as a campsite for soldiers in transit during the Creek War of 1814-1815. The name Fort Marr was established when the fort was renovated into a stockade to use during the removal of the Cherokee people to the west. It is believed that the fort was named after George Washington Lent Marr, who served under Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812 and the campaign of 1813-1814. After being relocated times since its construction, it was moved to its present location at Benton in 1965. In 1980, Fort Marr became the property of the Conservation Department of the state of Tennessee to be maintained and used as a historic site.</description.1>

    <description.0>This photograph is of a reconstructed blockhouse at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. There are four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort, with two blockhouses located at the west end of the fort and the other two located at the east end. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a more detailed examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and prehistoric features. Additional excavations were conducted at Fort Southwest Point in the 1990s yielded new information as to the fort's original layout and functions, as well as the life ways of the people who occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was given to the city of Kingston by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is now used as a historical and recreational area.</description.0>

    <description.1>This photograph is of a reconstructed barracks at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. The barracks are made with hewn logs and are double penned structures with a fireplace in the middle of the building. The barracks were most likely used to house the enlisted men that occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier.

    <description.1>This photograph is of unexcavated structural ruins at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. The ruins show that the structures were composed of stacked mortared and unmortared limestone blocks and, occasionally, river rocks. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier.

    <description.1>This photograph is of the Great Spring at the Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee. The Great Spring, also known as the Blue Hole Spring, is a natural spring that not only supplied the Cherokees who met here with potable water, but was also a sacred and spiritual place for them. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota, Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together. Thus, Red Clay became the sear of the Cherokee government in 1832 and lasted until the removal of the Cherokees to the west in 1838. Red Clay was composed of 11 general councils and the meetings were attended by up to 5000 people. It was at Red Clay that the Cherokee learned that they had lost all of their land and would be removed to the west. Red Clay consists of the sacred Blue Hole Spring, a reconstructed council house, and several reconstructed homestead buildings. Red Clay is also the home to the Eternal Flame, lit on April 6, 1984. The Cherokees took hot coals from their council fire at Ted Clay on the Trail of Tears. The flame was later taken to Cherokee, North Carolina in the 1950s but was returned to Red Clay in 1984. This was the first symbolic step unifying the Eastern Cherokees with the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma since their removal in 1838. Today Red Clay State Historical Park is not only a historical site, but is also an interpretive site on the Trail of Tears.</description.1>

    <description.1>This photograph is of a reconstructed Cherokee cabin at the Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee. The cabin is a chinked log cabin with two stories. There are also reconstructed outbuildings that would have associated with the Cherokee farmers' homesteads of the time. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota, Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together.

    <description.1>This photograph is of a reduced scale reconstruction of the Cherokee council house at the Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee. This reconstruction is of a summer council house, not the original house. The original council house would have been much larger in order to accommodate the nearly 5000 people who would have gathered there. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota, Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together.

    <description.0>This photograph is of a scale cabin reconstruction at the Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee. Federal Period Cherokee did not use machine rounded logs or saddle notch in the construction of their log cabins like what the photograph here shows. The Federal Period Cherokee would have cut their own logs and would have used wither dovetail, half-dovetail, or 'V' notching for their cabins. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota, Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together. Thus, Red Clay became the seat of the Cherokee government in 1832 and lasted until the removal of the Cherokees to the west in 1838. Red Clay was composed of 11 general councils and the meetings were attended by up to 5000 people. It was at Red Clay that the Cherokee learned that they had lost all of their land and would be removed to the west. Red Clay consists of the sacred Blue Hole Spring, a reconstructed council house, and several reconstructed homestead buildings. Red Clay is also the home to the Eternal Flame, lit on April 6, 1984. The Cherokees took hot coals from their council fire at Red Clay on the Trail of Tears. The flame was later taken to Cherokee, North Carolina in the 1950s but was returned to Red Clay in 1984. This was the first symbolic step unifying the Eastern Cherokees with the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma since their removal in 1838. Today Red Clay State Historical Park is not only a historical site, but is also an interpretive site on the Trail of Tears.</description.0>

    <description.0>This photograph is of unexcavated structural ruins at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. The ruins show that the structures were composed of stacked mortared and unmortared limestone blocks and, occasionally, river rocks. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a more detailed examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and prehistoric features. Additional excavations were conducted at Fort Southwest Point in the 1990s yielded new information as to the fort's original layout and functions, as well as the life ways of the people who occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was given to the city of Kingston by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is now used as a historical and recreational areal.</description.0>

    <description.1>This is a photograph of a Kaolin pipe fragment in situ on the Chattooga townhouse floor. Kaolin pipes are named for the white clay that they are made from. Kaolin pipes were made in England as early as the 17th century. Over time, the shape, size, and patterns changed on the pipes. Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s. This site is given special attention because it retained early 18th century Cherokee material culture. This material culture is difficult to find and distinguish on other Cherokee sites of the same time period. The University of Tennessee (UT) and the Francis Marion National Forest conducted archaeological excavations at Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus of these excavations was to develop a better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee occupation at the site and compare these findings with those found on other 18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists were able to identify and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed council houses. In addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one summer domestic structure were conducted. Through the use of surface collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the location of additional buildings and features were found with minimal disturbance to the site. The excavation of Chattooga is still an active research project with additional findings in the process of being documented.</description.1>

    <description.0>This photograph is of a reconstructed blockhouse at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. There are four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort, with two blockhouses located at the west end of the fort and the other two located at the east end. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a ore detailed examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and prehistoric features. Additional excavations were conducted at Fort Southwest Point in the 1990s yielded new information as to the fort's original layout and functions, as well as the life ways of the people who occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was given to the city of Kingston by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is now used as a historical and recreational area.</description.0>

    <description.0>This is a computer generated topographic site map of the Chattooga site indicating the location of archaeological structures. Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s. This site is given special attention because it retained early 18th century Cherokee material culture. This material culture is difficult to find and distinguish on other Cherokee sites of the same time period. The University of Tennessee (UT) and the Francis Marion National Forest conducted archaeological excavations at Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus of these excavations was to develop a better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee occupation at the site and compare these findings with those found on other 18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists were able to identify and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed council houses. In addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one summer domestic structure were conducted. Through the use of surface collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the location of additional buildings and features were found with minimal disturbance to the site. The excavation of Chattooga is still an active research project with additional findings in the process of being documented.</description.0>

    <description.0>This photograph is of a reconstructed blockhouse and stockade wall at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. The blockhouse is constructed from hewn logs and is one of four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort. The stockade was was first used as a defensive wall, but eventually was used to contain the Cherokees who were to be removed to the west. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier.

    <description.1>This is a photograph of the post hole pattern of an excavated townhouse at Chattooga. Townhouses were usually found in villages with a population of more than 350 people and was the most prominent building in the villages. Townhouses were where most of the social, ceremonial, and political activities took place in the village. Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s.

    <description.1>This is an aerial view of the Chattooga site oriented to the north. Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s. This site is given special attention because it retained early 18th century Cherokee material culture. This material culture is difficult to find and distinguish on other Cherokee sites of the same time period. The University of Tennessee (UT) and the Francis Marion National Forest conducted archaeological excavations at Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus of these excavations was to develop a better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee occupation at the site and compare these findings with those found on other 18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists were able to identify and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed council houses. In addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one summer domestic structure were conducted. Through the use of surface collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the location of additional buildings and features were found with minimal disturbance to the site. The excavation of Chattooga is still an active research project with additional findings in the process of being documented.</description.1>

This letter was written after the Creek War of 1813 had begun, and Meigs informs Armstrong that he had supplied the Cherokee with blankets and other supplies in compensation for their cooperation against the Creeks.

Earle was a congressman from Greenville, South Carolina.</description.1>

    <description.1>This letter, from Secretary of War William Eustis to Colonel Elias Earle, discusses the desire of Colonel Earle to establish an Ironworks in the Cherokee Nation. Eustis asks Colonel Earle to select another piece of land for the possible establishment of the Ironworks because the previous tract of land has been designated, by treaty, as a site for the Cherokee chiefs and warriors. Eustis also tells Colonel Earle that Colonel Meigs has been instructed to help in this selection of new land.</description.1>

    <description.0>Document ID: pa0214</description.0>
    <description.1>This document appears to be a letter to Return J. Meigs dated July 23, 1813 composed by several Cherokee chiefs at the request of Pathkiller, the principal chief, to inform Meigs of the growing Creek civil war. The letter tells that the town of Tooquachee (Toocabatchee) in the Creek Nation, where four different tribes of Indians once held friendly conferences, has been taken from Creek chief Big Warrior and destroyed. While Big Warrior is considered a "friendly" Creek, the letter states that the majority of Creek Nation has gone against him to join the rebel party. The Cherokees indicate that they have information that one of the prophets partly responsible for the uprising has escaped to the Choctaw Nation. Included is a warning from Big Warrior to the Cherokees to arm themselves against the rebellious Creeks along their borders.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter dated December 11, 1837, to Jesse Abernathy in Pulaski, TN, from William R. Brown. In the letter, Brown expressed concern regarding the influence of the Whigs in the state of Tennessee, particularly in Giles County, where Whigs had obtained control of the press. He stated that Henry Clay would be the presidential candidate of the Whigs to rival current president Andrew Jackson. Brown further stated that he had relinquished his political aspirations and had no plans to run for office. He also discussed the issues of banks and a pending bill in the Tennessee legislature that would funnel bond money into the creation of a state bank in Middle Tennessee. Another bill proposing to charter a bank was earlier rejected by the Tennessee senate.</description.1>

Led by General Andrew Jackson, the United States regular army, the Tennessee militia, Cherokee and Lower Creek Indians fought against the Upper Creek Indians at Horseshoe Bend, in present day Alabama.

    <description.1>This document is a letter written to Colonel Allison from John Cocke on September 6, 1813. The letter describes a possible meditated attack by the Creek Indians on the people living on the frontier. John Cocke orders Colonel Allison to put the first brigade of the militia on alert to defend the frontier if attacked by the Creeks. Cocke insists on being notified of any attacks or actions taken by the Colonel's brigade and offers expenditures for supplies needed in this defensive action. John Cocke concludes by warning Colonel Allison to not mistreat any friendly Indians, but to treat them with friendship and hospitality.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Henry Knox, Secretary of War, to David Henley on August 31, 1793. In the letter, Knox appointed Henley as an agent for the War Department in the Southwest Territory. Knox further detailed the duties of Henley's new position, which mostly included regulating payments and supplies of all sorts for the troops of the Southwest Territory and also preventing and correcting improper expenditures. David Allison was appointed as a subordinate paymaster, who would be working under Henley. Henley's position was initially established on a temporary basis in response to recent occurrences in the Southwest Territory that required the deployment of more troops and greater expenditures by the War Department.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is letter from Andrew Jackson (US president, 1829-1837) to Major William B. Lewis dated February 28, 1845. In the letter, Andrew Jackson states to Major Lewis his opinions about who he believes to be the best men for the Tennessee State Department administration. Jackson approves Mr. Clay for the Secretary of State position and Mr. Buchanan into the Department of State. He approves of Colonel Polk obtaining a position in the administration, but says that Mr. Tyler's succession to the administration would split the democracy apart and damage Polk's administration. Jackson concludes this letter by informing Major Lewis of his failing health. He consequently dies several months later.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter from A.J. Donalson to R.E.W. Earl dated May 6, 1821. In the letter, Donalson speaks of the hospitality of the citizens of New Orleans toward himself and his troops while they have been there. Donalson awaits information from Colonel Forbes on whether or not he has reached Pensacola, carrying orders to Cuba for the surrender of Florida to the United States. He states that after the information is attained, he will march to Pensacola as well and that troops will soon take possession of St. Augustine. Donalson states that people are moving from all parts of the country to Pensacola and that it has the potential to become a great commercial city. He concludes by asking R.E.W. Earl to finish the portrait of Donalson that he started and present it to his mother when it is completed.</description.1>

    <description.1>The following document is a letter, dated April 20, 1844, from Samuel Laughlin to Major W. J. Whitthorne in Shelbyville, Tennessee. In the letter, Laughlin discusses both national and state politics. He updates Whitthorne on election results from around the country, and he warns that a fierce battle must be fought to prevail against the Whigs in upcoming elections. Laughlin, an ardent supporter of James K. Polk, was also one of the "Immortal Thirteen" who, fearing the election of a Whig, refused to meet with the Tennessee House to elect a representative to the U.S. Senate, leaving Tennessee unrepresented in the Senate for 1841-1843.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter dated March 22, 1829 from Andrew Jackson to William Donelson. The subject of the letter is Jackson's son Andrew Jackson Hutchings, who came under Jackson's supervision after the death of his father John Hutchings. The tone of the letter is one of regret at Hutchings' poor performance as a student, and the resignation that he will not be a classical scholar, but may be more aptly suited to life as a farmer.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a booklet, printed by J. M. G. Lescure in 1850, which includes President Andrew Jackson's Farewell Address and his Proclamation to South Carolina. The Farewell Address was given on March 4, 1837, as Jackson prepared to retire from the presidency and from public life in general. In the address, he discusses his presidency's contributions to the nation, as well as his opposition to the national bank and nullification. The Proclamation to South Carolina was written on December 10, 1832, in response to an earlier decision of the state legislature of South Carolina to nullify a recent tariff bill passed by the federal government. Jackson severely chastises the insistence that states are sovereign and have the right to nullify federal laws, and he accuses South Carolina of trying to disrupt the Union and transgressing the Constitution.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Andrew Jackson to Fr. P. Blair on July 28, 1840. In the letter, Jackson defends Blair and General Jessup against allegations made by General Scott. General Scott alleged that Blair and General Jessup recalled him from military duty in Florida, when in fact it was Jackson. General Scott had been ordered to Florida to look for Indian warriors and to prevent a war with the Creeks. Instead of following orders to go directly to Florida, taking eight days worth of supplies on the soldiers' backs, Scott took three weeks waiting for wagons to take the supplies to Florida. Several of the soldiers were killed in an attack while waiting for the wagons, and Scott became ill. General Jessup was sent to fight the now explosive war with the Creeks and Scott went to where Jessup's soldiers were and attempted to take command of them. Because of this action, as well as not arming his troops for six weeks on the frontier, Jackson recalled General Scott from his command duties. Jackson also mentions political events in the letter, such as the pass of the Independent Treasury bill and the next Presidential election.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written to John Sevier from Andrew Jackson on October 11, 1803. In the letter, Jackson is still challenging Sevier to a duel and is agreeable to meet him at the Cumberland Gap in Virginia. Jackson suggests that Sevier name the time for when they are to meet. This letter was refused delivery by Governor Sevier, saying that he wanted nothing to do with the letter, duel, or Jackson, and was therefore never read.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written to Brigadier General William Hall from Andrew Jackson on December 21 in the early 1790's. In the letter, Andrew and Governor William Blount question the term of service under which the Tennessee Volunteers are obligated to serve. Jackson asks Hall to give the Volunteers orders of service because their term of service has not yet expired. Jackson states that neither he nor the Governor can order the Volunteers, that they can only take orders from General Hall.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Andrew Jackson to Robert Chester on March 3, 1833. In the letter, Jackson informs Chester that his nomination as surveyor has been rejected by the Senate because he is not a resident of Mississippi. Jackson's attempts to get the Senate to reverse their decision was futile, and they appointed a man that had previously been turned down for the same reason as Chester.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is an address written by John Sevier on February 27, 1813. Sevier discusses the topics and events that have taken place in Washington during the last government session. In the address, Sevier states that more money and manpower will be given to the army and navy in order to fight the British. The navy at this time is strong, while the army's land battles have not been very successful. In fighting the British, many American soldiers have been taken as prisoners in Canada. Sevier worries that with the southern soldiers joining the northern troops near the Canadian border, that the Cherokee and whites remaining in the south will be at war over land and rights. Sevier states that Congress has reported using $21 million in expenditures and proposes a further $20 million be used for merchant bonds. Congress also rejected a bill requiring a 25 cent per gallon tax on the sale of whiskey. Sevier concludes the address by mentioning events and disputes in Europe between England, Spain, France, and Russia.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by N. B. Hamilton to his cousin, James L. Alexander, on September 2, 1838. In the letter, Hamilton tells Alexander about a dinner he went to in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where James K. Polk was giving a speech. He says that there were many Whigs at the dinner. His overall impression of Polk was lessened when he heard the speech and saw his actions with the Whigs at the dinner. Hamilton states that there are country lawyers that give better speeches than Polk.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from Jane Bell to her brother William dated August 17, probably 1840. Jane offers the good news that, contrary to previous worries, she is still alive and well. She also writes that millwrights have been in town and that they will be leaving soon. She regrets that she has not seen all their work as apparently it is as entertaining as a stage show. She writes that she is expecting visits from many family members and that it would be nice if someone from TN came also. She wants William to write her weekly.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from Margaret V. Bell to her sister Ann Jane Bell dated March 28, 1838. Margaret writes that many of the weddings mentioned in her last letter did not happen. Mr. Lee has stopped preaching because people have stopped going to hear him. Apparently he did something the community did not approve of. He is still running the school, now with his new wife, Elizabeth Roberts. Margaret thanks Jane for the gifts she sent, especially some monogram thimbles and shields. The family's candidate for circuit court clerk, John C. Collier won the election. The family has been reading Young's Night Thoughts and greatly enjoying it. She writes of improvements to the farm and domestic chores. The family is well except their father who is weak and feeble. She also mentions a girl named Elennora as the belle of Nashville.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from Sarah Bell to her sister Ann Jane Bell dated June 27, 1837. She complains that her family would not let her write to Jane because they were worried Jane would not want to pay the postage. She writes that the family has been concerned for her and that their mother wants to know what kind of medicine she is taking. Sarah updates Jane on the news from the neighborhood, sicknesses, marriages, etc. The sisters are trying to decide between a barbecue or a speech on temperance as their July 4th activities. Margaret has greatly enjoyed the book The Three Eras of a Woman's Life. They did not like Mrs. Cary's book because she thinks that all women should be punished for what Eve may have done, and the sisters do not agree. Sarah wants to be sure that Jane will send her a copy of her piece on Presentiment and her anecdote.</description.1>

    <description.0>This is a letter from Return J. Meigs, agent to the Cherokee Nation, to Major General John Cocke, dated September 3, 1813. Meigs writes that he thinks that the Cherokee who had volunteered to fight against the Creek should be put together and supervised by another Cherokee. The whole group should then come under the command of a United States citizen who is familiar with Cherokee fighting. He agrees with Governor Blount that the Cherokee expedition should be lead by Judge Cocke.</description.0>

    <description.0>This is a letter to John Cocke dated December 23, 1828. The writer is in favor of the US developing a permanent navy. The writer's opinion is that the people in a republican country (as far as keeping their personal freedoms) are safer because of their navy than they would be from an army. He is also concerned about protecting valuable ports from blockade.</description.0>

He is thus inquiring of his uncle to appoint him Vice Consul for the United States to China, despite the fact that he is a British citizen.</description.0>

    <description.0>These are three different documents. The first one is dated Dec. 15, 1814, and is written by James Hamilton. It is a quit of claim of the Cherokee/African slaves that his brother in law, Joseph Brown took back from the Cherokee Chief Cotetoy. The slaves were descendents of a slave named Sue that was owned by Hamilton's father in law (Joseph Brown's father), James Brown, and stolen by Cotetoy. The second paper is the registration certification for said quit, written by Joseph Porter in May 1816. The third paper is dated Dec. 15, 1814. It is a quit of claim to two slaves, Jinney and Suey, and offspring, by William Anderson. He also states that Joseph Brown has payed him $150 for the portion of James Brown's estate that Anderson inherited.</description.0>

    <description.0>This is a letter from David F. Brown to his father Joseph Brown dated Febrary 22, 1843. David updates his father about his family, his brother Joseph, and the death of a woman named Julia Ann. David mentions skirmishes between Mexican and US soldiers as far into Texas as San Antonio. Twelve US soldiers were taken prisoner, but the people have hope they will be released because there is a revolution against Santa Anna going on in Mexico. He also mentions that Jane (unsure if he is referring to his aunt, wife, or sister in law by brother Joseph) wishes to visit Joseph in order to improve her health.</description.0>

    <description.0>This is a letter dated February 27, 1846. It is from a woman named Ada to L. E., who is probably a man. Ada writes about a terrible event in her town where a woman named Rosalie died from a broken heart after being betrayed by a womanizer. Ada is very upset because she feels that it is a common occurrence, and admonishes L. E. never to do anything of the sort. She also mysteriously writes that she may have to stop corresponding with him.</description.0>

    <description.1>This is a letter from George House to his wife Mary House, dated March 13, 1843. He is upset that she does not want to write to him more often. He writes that he will not go to Alabama as it would increase the distance between them. He writes about seeing the Great Comet of 1843. He mentions that astronomers have predicted another comet will also be visible soon. Because the comet which became known as the Great Comet of 1843 was unknown and unexpected, he believes the Millerites will make something of it. Finally, he gives some local news.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from Joshua L. Wilson to Joseph Hamilton, dated July 17, 1800. Wilson laments his money troubles. He just lost some court cases that caused him to lose some of his land. Wilson asks Hamilton if he would be willing to trade land for horses. Wilson writes about the upcoming election. He is concerned for the reputation of Hamilton's area if an undesirable candidate, whom Wilson calls the King of Beasts, is elected. Apparently this man came to office by nefarious means, and it is proving difficult to remove him.</description.1>

Holland, Buck Hart, and Mr. Farley. Howell writes that he misses Tennessee, and that it was the happiest time of his life. He writes that he likes Wisconsin partly because it is a Democratic state. Howell is disappointed that the Whig party won the last election. He hopes they will not reverse the decisions, policies, and laws of the previous administration.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter to Mr. Stephens or Adam Fergusson from J. R. A. Tarnking, dated October 20, 1840. Tarnking has enclosed another letter from Felix Robertson dated September 25, 1840. Robertson is concerned that the Federalist party [aka as the Whig Party] will give the Democratic Republicans a run for their money in the upcoming election. He accuses the Federalists of misconduct in regards to the election of 1939, and warns that they have been threatening to use force. Robertson instructs Fergusson to make tickets for each Democratic voter, in order to reduce the chance of voter fraud. In Tarnking's letter, he reports that he has made tickets for Smith County.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from William Barnett to Finis Ewing, dated June 4, 1823. Barnett writes about the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and its various members. He is concerned about the legitimacy of some of the preachers. He writes about some pamphlets that the old style Presbyterians have been circulating that are slanderous to the new style, Cumberland Presbyterians. Barnett plans to propose a formal split between the Cumberlands and other Presbyterians at the next synod, and asks for Ewing's support. He mentions a possible move to Forked Deer. Barnett also writes that he and others want Ewing to write a history about the origins of the Cumberland Presbyterians. Many people have been expressing curiosity, but cannot find information them because Buck's Theological Dictionary is out of print.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from William Barnett to Finis Ewing, dated March 19, 1925. Barnett complains that Ewing has not written him in a while. He writes that he will continue sending Ewing letters, though. Barnett writes extensively about his Presbytery. Barnett asks Ewing's advice on whether his Synod should change to a General Assembly because of its size. Barnett writes that he lives near Ewing's nephew, Joseph Lynn. He has many good things to say about Lynn and his family. He mentions having pains in his stomach that he believes are signs of a fatal illness. Barnett worries a great deal about his ability to stay a good, Christian man. He also worries about what will happen to him if he becomes unable to preach, as it is his only skill.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter dated June 23, 1845. It is to Andrew Jackson Donelson in the care of Major Thomas B. Eastland, from his brother Daniel S. Donelson. Andrew is returning from Texas where he has been conducting annexation negotiations. Daniel is considering a trip to Washington D.C. in relation to some land that he wants near the Rio Grande. He hopes to meet William Marcy, President Polk's Secretary of War. Daniel writes to Andrew that he wishes that Andrew could have made it to General Andrew Jackson's deathbed. Daniel expresses regret that General Houston did not make it either, until right after Jackson had died.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is the Journal kept by John Donelson on his trip from Fort Patrick Henry to French Salt Springs which he also refers to as the Big Salt Lick. He travels down the Holston, French Broad, Clinch, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers. The trip starts on December 22, 1779 and is completed on April 24, 1780. Donelson's boat is joined early in the voyage by several others going along the same route. Donelson writes about an accident they have on the French Broad river in February. One of the other vessels sinks. A slave dies on the Clinch river in March from severe frost bite. Later that month the travellers have trouble with the Chickamaugas, who have villages down the south side of the Tennessee River. Captain Blackemore's boat, which had been quarantined from the others due to small pox, is attacked by these natives, and many people are killed or captured. Donelson writes about the flotilla trying to navigate the Whirl, a particularly dangerous place on the Tennessee River near Chattanooga. There, they are attacked again by the Chickamaugas. One family named Jennings is left behind when their boat becomes trapped in the Whirl, but they are able to eventually catch up to the others. Donelson writes about trouble they have going through the Muscle Shoals in mid-March. On the Cumberland River they begin to have food shortages and are forced to hunt buffalo to survive. When they arrive in Big Salt Lick, they meet Captain Robertson and company. The group decides to stay temporarily in some log cabins they find.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from Major General Edmond P. Gaines to Newton Cannon, governor of Tennessee. It is dated August 28, 1836. Gaines is in charge of protecting the Western Frontier of the United States from attack by Mexicans and Native Americans, who are fighting the Texans. Gaines' request for more gunmen has been refused by President Jackson. Gaines writes an apology to Cannon for any embarrassment this occurrence may have caused him, though Gaines still thinks he is right about needing the extra men to repel a major assault from the Natives, which he feels will be inevitable when the Mexican army crosses the Brazos River in western Texas. Gaines is very concerned about not being able to protect the settlers in the Disputed Territory from a massacre, since something similar happened in East Florida. Gaines also complains that the people in the interior, who are influential and educated, do not care about the welfare of the frontier families.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter dated August 10, 1836, written by Edmund Pendleton Gaines, commander of the US Army Western Division, to General Arbuckle at Fort Gibson, Arkansas. Gaines reports of hostility perceived and expected from Native American tribes in Texas, who were allying with the Mexican army during its war against Texas. He talks specifically about the Cherokees, led by Chief Bowl, who had been pushed west into Texas, and the Caddoes. Gaines also discusses the fate of Mexican leader Santa Anna, and he commends Arbuckle on his ordering of troops from Missouri and Arkansas to protect frontier settlers from possible Native American attacks.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from General Edmund Pendleton Gaines to James Chamberlain Jones, Governor of Tennessee. It is dated October 7, 1841. Gaines writes in reference to a recent Act of Congress authorizing a "House Squadron". He is concerned that the port towns of the United States are not defendable against ships running under steam power. Gaines is also concerned that a war with a European power is possible. He believes that the Native Americans he is defending the Western Frontier from might unite with a European aggressor. Gaines offers recommendations for building and staffing forts, and mentions the need for rail roads west of the Mississippi River. Gaines lists some ideas for how to deal with the Native American and European threats. He also lists his objections to current U.S. military policy, especially in regards to forts and New Orleans' defence against war ships under steam power.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from General Edmund Pendleton Gaines to Samuel J. Peters, President of the Chamber of Commerce, dated January 22, 1839. Gaines is writing in response to a recent report by the Chamber on improving navigation of the Mississippi River. Gaines describes in great detail the mannerisms of the Mississippi River and how it differs from other rivers, especially concerning formation of alluvial lands. Gaines writes how important the river is in relation to national defence, commerce, and agriculture. Gaines also includes his opinions on improving national defence in relation to the use of railroads, and waterways. Accompanying Gaines' letter is a note dated April 6, 1839 from C. W. Dreschler, who is forwarding the letter to Tennessee Governor Newton Cannon per Gaines' request. Gaines hopes that the Governor will consider the views expressed in his letter.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter to Newton Cannon, Governor of Tennessee, from General Edmund Pendleton Gaines, dated October 14, 1838. Gaines writes extensively about his proposal to build a series of canals, turnpike roads, and railroads from the interior to the frontier. He sites evidence from the War of 1812 (which he refers to as the War of 1814) and European wars as to why these avenues are necessary. He offers several complaints against the existence of political parties and their detrimental effects to the United States. He writes about the importance of steam powered engines. Gaines is very concerned with protecting the borders from European and Native American nations combining their forces against the United States.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter to an unknown person dated April 6, 1831. The author is probably Adam Fergusson. Fergusson is writing about what he sees as the growing corruption in government and particularly politicians. Fergusson believes that elected officials are misusing their power against people whose opinions differ from their own. He writes that many people are outraged by a recently passed law. Fergusson believes that all Congressmen should take oaths of loyalty to the U.S. constitution and the Tennessee constitution. He mentions the Alen family that has gained control over many local offices of trust. Fergusson believes that this monopoly is harmful to the other citizens of the county. Fergusson gives some new information pertaining to a recent scandal involving defalcation, Colonel Parrish, a Mr. Cooper and the State Bank.</description.1>

He describes in great detail how good the alluvial land is for growing crops. McGavock describes the local wild foliage. McGavock writes that it is also perfect for livestock as there are many grassy meadows. He believes that the area will have a greater population than Tennessee because the farm land is so fertile. McGavock offers to act as agent to Overton and any others who want to invest in land in the territory.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter dated December 21, 1843 from James K Polk to John P Heiss. Polk marks the letter as confidential as he explains the importance of selecting the appropriate editor for a paper called the "Union." He says the paper would be a strategic voice for the Democratic party in the state of Tennessee, and that the public must remain unaware of what is being arranged by the parties. Polk would go on to become the 11th president of the United States in 1845.</description.1>

Though he does not worry about an invasion, he still believes that a strong defence is necessary. Claiborne also writes that the Army would not be able to withstand an attack if one did occur. He believes they should concentrate on training and equipping the militia as a permanent protection force.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from David Henley to U.S. Comptroller of the Treasury, Gabriel Duvall, dated March 3, 1808. Henley has apparently been accused of owing money from his time spent as an agent for the War Department in Tennessee (formerly the Territory Southwest of the Ohio River.) This letter is explaining in detail his time there. Henley mentions many of the people he worked with. He explains how hard he worked and how little his pay was, comparing his job and salary to other's. He defends his actions, pleads for justice, and promises to pay some of the money back.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter dated January 20, 1815 from John McKee to General James Winchester. McKee reports on the business of recruitment service, specifically, that during the winter season most Choctaw gun-owners are currently engaged in hunting food for their families, and therefore, that his quarter should not be relied upon until their return. He also mentions the recent victory of General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans against the British, and as a result, the Choctaw Indians will probably not be needed there.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document, dated October 2, 1828, is a letter from the fourth governor of Alabama, John Murphy to the governor of Tennessee, Sam Houston. Murphy's purpose in writing the letter is to establish communication between the two chief-executives concerning mutual interests of their respective states. Specifically, a federal fund, approved by congress for the opening of a canal to improve navigation of the river at Muscle Shoal, Alabama. This improvement, according to Murphy, will open the market of New Orleans to much of Alabama, and East Tennessee via the Tennessee River. He states in the letter, however, that he believes the construction of a rail road would be a superior alternative to the canal.</description.1>

    <description.1>This is a letter from Governor John Sevier to Colonel James Ore, dated May 12, 1790. Sevier is ordering Ore to go to the Cherokee Nation to find out their intentions towards a treaty. Sevier also asks Ore to recommend to the Cherokee the merits of an agrarian lifestyle over that of hunting. Sevier hopes that the Cherokee can be persuaded to part with more of their land. Sevier suggests they set up a trading post at Tellico. He also mentions the Law of Nations in relation to the Cherokees having more land than they can cultivate.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a rough draft composition of a letter to former Tennessee state senator Andrew Jackson. The letter is written by the governor of the state, John Sevier of Koxville, Tennessee, and is dated August 29, 1798. In the letter, Sevier informs Jackson that he has heard from respectable sources that if appointed to a position of judgeship, he would accept; the letter is an official offer from the governor's office for the position. Jackson would accept, and serve the Superior Court of Tennesse from 1798-1804, he would later become the seventh president of the United States in 1829.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written on June 9, 1803, by Tennessee Governor Archibald Roane (1801-1803) to Secretary at War Henry Dearborn. In the letter, Roane informed Dearborn of a road in Tennessee which was believed to be inhabited by bandits who had been attacking travellers. It was unknown if the bandits were Indians, white men, or both. Roane offered some suggestions concerning the insurance safety of the travellers, including offering a reward to induce the Indians to help catch the culprits. Roane expressed concern that if it were discovered that the bandits were from an Indian tribe, relations between the Indians and whites in the region would deteriorate.</description.1>

Moore would also be responsible for protecting the boat against attacks by the Creek and Cherokee, as well as protecting Opoia Mingo and his tribe. Furthermore, the article outlined how Moore and his crew would be paid for their services.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document was written by Governor Joseph McMinn (1815-1821) to Secretary of State Daniel Graham on November 19, 1818. Governor McMinn writes that he will soon have taken the land east of the Mississippi River from the Cherokee and that if they want compensation, they must relinquish their possessions and claims to the United States within a certain number of years. He adds that the Cherokee look up to him for guidance, and he has been witness to vast amounts of monies and supplies trading hands for the trip west.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document, entitled "Thrilling Narrative. How The Judgement of Heaven fell on the Indians who wounded Rev'd Joseph Brown in 1794," was written to Colonel A. W. Putman on March 30, 1858 by Reverend Joseph Brown. In this narrative Brown details the events surrounding his return trip from Knoxville to Nashville. It appears that he was informed by a Cherokee trader that there was a large body of Indians waiting to do harm on the direct route, so he was advised to return through Kentucky. Accepting this advice, Brown and travel partners, William Hayes, a Negro woman, Ross, Friley, and others set out only to be ambushed along the way by Indians. During the attack Brown was wounded in the shoulder although they escaped. He stayed with a Dutch man for two nights and then with a brother-in-law, who was a doctor, of Ross's for six weeks, until he healed well enough to travel home. Later, Brown was informed by another trader that the same party of Indians had rode into East Tennessee to take prisoners of women and children and if Brown and others wanted to free the prisoners he would show them where they were. Brown set out with a group of white men to seek revenge on the Indians. When they located them they noticed that the Indians were wearing white men's clothing and, satisfied that these were the guilty Indians, they decided to lay in wait to ambush them in the morning fearing that the prisoners would be killed if they acted too quickly. The Indians were all killed the next day and the white men found a little girl who had hid for three days. Brown submitted this account with the intent that it would be published or returned. It was, in fact, published in the "Banner of Peace" August 5, 1858.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Henry Sherburne, agent for the Chickasaw Nation, to an unknown recipient on August 7, 1819. In the letter, Sherburne explains that the Chickasaw Nation had objections to the boundary line of their land that the recipient of the letter had laid out. The letter also states that the line has been drawn without regard to specifications listed in the treaty between the Chickasaw and the United States government. Sherburne states that the Chickasaw want nothing but a new line drawn that respects the conditions noted in the treaty.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Cherokee Colonel Gideon Morgan to Colonel Return J. Meigs on February 4, 1814. The letter is Morgan's account of a battle during the Creek War of 1813-1814, in which General Andrew Jackson's American forces allied with the Cherokee against Creek warriors. While it first appeared that the Creeks had the upper-hand in the battle, Jackson's troops were able to maintain their ground and gain victory in the end. Morgan was able to estimate the losses on both sides, and he stated that afterwards the Cherokee were permitted to return to their homes. Morgan, who was writing from Fort Armstrong, also reported that more troops and Cherokees were expected to arrive at the fort, and he noted that at that time provisions were scarce.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document, entitled "Account of a Battle Axe Taken from an Indian at the Battle of Long Island Flats in 1776," is the description of a Tomahawk rendered to the Historical Society of Tennessee by Alfred H. White. According to White's story, which was related to him by Mr. George W. Netherland, the Tomahawk was believed to have belonged to a Cherokee known as "Big Indian" on account of his stature and status. During this East Tennessee Revolutionary battle, an American soldier by the name of Moore came in contact with "Big Indian" during a charge. The two engaged in a one-on-one conflict, which eventually resulted in Moore defeating and killing the Cherokee. The referred to Tomahawk was found near where the action took place and was further believed to have belonged to the "Big Indian" because of its large size. The document was received by the Historical Society of Tennessee on January 6, 1860.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter from William Blount, Governor of the state of Tennessee from 1790 to 1795, to General Smith, dated June 17, 1793. In his letter, Blount stated that he had been informed that the President and Secretary of War were awaiting his arrival in order to discuss business regarding the Indians in the South. Blount and others were apparently unhappy with the Indians, and Blount suggested that a full-scale war was the only way to coerce them into acting in accordance with the US's wishes. Blount also discussed providing arms for the frontier settlers.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by General James L. Robertson to Colonel David Henley of Knoxville, dated October 24, 1795. In the letter, Robertson warned Henley about the Creek Indians, who, although they appeared to be seeking peace with the United States and neighboring tribes, had been instigating hostilities with the Chickasaw Indians. Robertson described a battle between the two tribes, which he stated was initiated by a Creek offensive, yet concluded by a Chickasaw victory. Robertson explained that the attack would prevent the Chickasaws from hunting, which in turn would require the US government to send more provisions. The letter concluded with Robertson offering Henley a proposal to purchase land. Enclosed with the letter was a copy of a letter written by Chickasaw chief Pioming (referred to by Robertson as Opiomingo), which further described the Creeks' hostility and asked for assistance from the US government.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a copy of a letter, dated September 29, 1795, by Chickasaw chief Piomingo (indicated in this letter as Opy Omingo and Opoia mingo) that was written to General James Robertson and sent to Colonel David Henley. Piomingo wrote this letter as a plea to the United States government for assistance. Hostility existed between the Chickasaws and the Creeks, and the letter described an attack by the Creek on the Chickasaw Nation. Although the Chickasaw were able to hold off and defeat the Creek, they endured considerable losses. Piomingo urged Robertson to think of Chickasaws as the brothers of Americans and that brothers should want to help each other in times of need. The Chickasaw chief asked for troops and provisions to be sent to his nation.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document, entitled "Opposition of McGillivray the Great Chief of the Creeks" is comprised of two parts. The first is a letter written by Colonel James Robertson to Creek chief Alexander McGillivray on August 3, 1788. In that letter, Robertson discussed episodes of violence between the Creeks and/or Cherokees and American settlers and troops. Robertson also offered McGillivray a gun and some land in the Cumberland region. The second part of the document is a detailed explanation of Robertson's letter written by A.W. Putnam in 1859. Putnam provided an analysis of the historical context of the letter as well as his own opinions of the situations at hand at the time the letter was written. Putnam described the hostilities that existed between the Creeks and the American frontier settlers. He painted a portrait of the Creeks and the other tribes of the region as "treacherous and wily and cruel savages" who were working with foreign governments, particularly the Spanish, to undermine American aims. Putnam analyzed the connotation of Robertson's words to McGillivray, by stating that it was both threatening and complementing at the same time. Putnam also related details of the state of the American government at the time, particularly the shift from the initial loose confederacy of states to the current federalist form of government. He discussed how the initial instability, particularly in the South, of the newly formed United States, desires to settle West, and ongoing conflicts with the Spanish complicated relations with the Native American tribes, specifically the Creeks. Putnam also reported his analysis of McGillivray's character. McGillivray is presented as a cunning, influential man who was after his own interests and who was working with the Spanish to thwart American settlement. To Putnam, Robertson's letter presented McGillivray with a compromise--that his financial and political success would be guaranteed as long as he used his influence to encourage American aims in the frontier. As Putnam noted, two years after Robertson's 1788 letter, a treaty was concluded which established secure Indian land boundaries, ceded a large territory of land to the US, and gave McGillivray the rank of Brigadier General and a salary from the government. Thus, the US government was able to allay the Creek Nation.</description.1>

    <description.1>The following document is an undated letter addressed to the chiefs of the Creek Nation, which appears to have been written on behalf of the white settlers living along the Shawnee River. In this letter, the settlers appear to have been making an offer of peace with the Creeks. The letter states that the Chickasaws, who were in good relations with the whites, had informed the settlers that the majority of the Creek people wished to be at peace with them. However, the letter refers to several instances that were looked at as being acts of aggression by the Creeks, including the theft of some horses and the loss of white lives. The letter also mentions an instance in which the settlers stumbled upon a deserted Indian camp and retained the horses and other articles from that camp, securing them until it was known to what tribe they belonged. The settlers contend they moved to the West with the intention of being at peace with all the tribes there, nor, they state, do they wish to encroach upon Indian lands or molest Indian peoples.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter, dated January 12, 1797, written to Silas Dinsmore, agent to the Cherokee, from Governor John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801). The letter was written partly in response to inquiries made earlier by Dinsmore regarding Indian land boundaries in the Cumberland area. Sevier explained that Americans could begin settling in areas as low as the Tennessee River and that the settlements boundary line the government was experimenting with was going to be extended. Sevier devoted the second half of the letter to discussing problems between the white settlers and the Cherokee, by stating that several complaints had been made about robberies and plundering believed to have been committed by some Cherokees. Sevier expressed disdain toward this conduct and feared it would hinder peace. Sevier also enclosed a letter he had written to Cherokee chiefs.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter addressed to the warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, written by Governor John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801) and dated January 12, 1797. The letter was given to Cherokee agent Silas Dinsmore to be read aloud to the Cherokee. In his letter, Sevier accused some Cherokees of stealing horses and plundering wagons that had passed through the Cumberland road. Sevier laid the blame on "foolish young people" within the Cherokee Nation but hoped the chiefs and warriors were not encouraging such acts. Sevier urged the Cherokee leaders to work with Dinsmore in getting the stolen property returned. Sevier also expressed condolences for the murder of an Indian and stated that he doubted any of his people would do such a thing. The letter was initially ended on a note of warning to the Cherokee, as Sevier insinuated that if they continued their aggressive behavior, war would be option. However, the last two sections of the original letter were deleted from the final text.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Tennessee Governor John Sevier (1796-1801) to the members of Congress, dated January 17, 1797. Sevier reported that it was believed that Cherokees had been plundering the wagons of frontier settlers along the Cumberland road and taking their horses, and he stated that the Cherokee agent had complained about the size of the territory awarded to frontier settlers. Also reported, was that at least one Indian had been killed, but Sevier had doubts about this because the subject had not been brought before him by the Cherokees or their agent. After he made complaints about inefficiencies within the postal system, Sevier explained that Captains Wades and Sparks had arrived in the frontier but that their companies were insufficient. Sevier requested that three companies of infantry and a troop of horses be sent to help protect the frontier.</description.1>

He requested three companies of infantry and a troop of cavalry be sent as well in order to protect the frontier settlers and scare the Indians. Sevier also informed McHenry that several families had their horses stolen and wagons plundered along the Cumberland road, and he had written to Cherokee chiefs and their agent to prevent such acts. Sevier ended his letter by claiming that he would endeavor to prevent encroachments upon the hunting grounds of the Indians.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter dated February 10, 1797, addressed to the warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation by Governor John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801). Sevier sent his apologies for the recent violence that had been committed against several of the Cherokees. He also criticized the chiefs for not making any complaints about these actions, for it impeded the process of apprehending the perpetrators. Sevier stated that although the murders of two Cherokees were committed in Kentucky, the murderers were from Tennessee. Sevier, however, changed his tone when he began to speak of crimes committed against White people by Cherokees. He warned them that if such actions did not cease, it would bring about a war, which would have disastrous consequences for the Cherokee Nation.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written to Benjamin Hawkins, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, from Tennessee Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on February 17, 1797. In this letter, Sevier accounted the story of two slaves belonging to Captain James Richardson who had run away and ended up in the Cherokee Nation. The slaves were then taken by a member of the Creek Nation, who announced he would not relinquish possession of the slaves until some of his horses stolen by Cherokees, were returned. Sevier also told Hawkins that it is suspected that Creeks and/or Cherokees had recently been exerting aggression against settlers in the Cumberland, having killed one man and stealing several horses. Sevier requested that Hawkins attempt to have the slaves and horses returned as soon as possible.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter, dated March 5, 1797, written by Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) and addressed to John Watts and other chiefs of the Cherokee Nation. The letter was written in response to a letter by the Cherokee chiefs regarding earlier communications sent by Sevier. In this letter, Sevier negated the claims of Watts and others that the Cherokees have not caused damage to the persons or properties of white settlers. Sevier cited instances in which white settlers were killed in retaliation for the murders of Chief Red Bird and his attendant. Sevier also criticized the Cherokee Nation for not making an official complaint regarding those murders. Furthermore, he denied Watts' claim that his preceding communications were threatening in nature, as he stated that he was merely hoping to convince the Cherokees of the dangers of going to war. Sevier contended that he wished to establish and promote a peace between the United States and the Cherokee Nation.</description.1>

Sevier reported that he had been requested by the Governor of Kentucky to have the two Tennessee citizens who murdered Red Bird and another Cherokee apprehended and sent to Kentucky to be tried for their crime. Sevier stated that he had sent forth orders in compliance with this request, and he was now urging the Cherokee leaders to capture those from amongst their people who were responsible for the murders of several white citizens. Sevier warned the Cherokees of the dangers of bringing about a war, which could be the consequence of further acts of aggression between the citizens of the United States and those of the Cherokee Nation.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written to James McHenry, Secretary of War, from Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on April 24, 1797. The letter is mainly in reference to the arrival of two men by the names of Hawkins and Pickens in Tennessee in order to determine the Indian boundary line. Sevier explained that the drawing of the line had caused much uneasiness among Tennessee settlers who feared that their residences might fall within Indian boundaries. Sevier suggested that the drawing of the line be postponed in the case of conflict with the European powers, for he also warned the the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws were all in friendly alliances with the Spanish government. Sevier feared that drawing the line would only spark tensions between these tribes and the American citizens.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Benjamin Hawkins, agent and superintendent to the Creek Nation, dated April 26, 1797. Sevier wrote the letter on behalf of a woman by the name of Lillean Williams, who was taken prisoner by Creeks several years ago. While under Creek supervision, Williams had given birth to a daughter, and since the girl was born in the Creek Nation, she was not released with her mother. Sevier requested that Hawkins make enquiries regarding the whereabouts and possible release of the girl, who was then eight years old.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter of instructions written by the Governor of Tennessee, John Sevier (1796-1801,1803-1809) to state agents James Robertson, James Stuart, and Lachlan McIntosh. The letter is dated July 4, 1798. Sevier stated that he appointed the agents to represent the interests of the state of Tennessee on the issues of a treaty to be made between the United States and the Cherokee. Among the issues Sevier noted for the three men to pay close attention to were the Indian boundary lines and the state districts in close contact with those boundaries. Sevier also commanded the men to examine the grounds of the Cherokee, to question the constitutionality of Cherokee land claims whenever possible, and to try to get more roads, rivers, and ports in the possession of the state.</description.1>

In the letter, Sevier informed the men that James Robertson, James Stuart, and Major Lachlan McIntosh had been appointed as agents to represent the interests of the state of Tennessee in the insuing treaty. Sevier stated that the state agents would do all that is in their power to aid the commissioners in extinguishing the Cherokee claims. Sevier explained that state agents were necessary because of their connections with the region at hand, and thus, they could better represent the interests of the people there and could prove advantageous to the negotiations.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Tennessee Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809), dated February 9, 1804, and addressed to the warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation. In the letter, Sevier reported that the recent murders of Cherokee men in Buncombe County, North Carolina, were not committed by a resident of Tennessee. Sevier had received a description of the man suspected and had been informed that he had likely fled to Tennessee, in which case Sevier assured the Cherokee leaders that he would do his best to have the man apprehended. The Governor also briefly discussed business of a road being opened through the Cherokee Nation and suggested that arrangements for such should be made soon.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Tennessee Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on April 1, 1804, and addressed to the white inhabitants residing on lands reserved by the US government for the Cherokee Indians. In the letter, Sevier informed the settlers that by encroaching upon the Cherokee's lands, they were violating the laws of the United States and the treaty between the US and the Cherokee Nation, and he warned them that if they continue there, they would be forcibly removed from the land. Sevier also announced that he was hopeful that the Cherokee claims to lands in northern Tennessee would soon be extinguished and that, furthermore, it would be possible to acquire from the Cherokee lands to the east of the Mississippi River in exchange for land west. Sevier also encouraged the settlers to venture out onto the great expanse of land newly acquired from France instead of maintaining ideas of remaining on Cherokee lands.</description.1>

In the letter, Sevier informed these men that he had received word of a meeting to be held with the commissioners of Georgia regarding a road that would be built connecting the two states, which would also run through Cherokee lands. Sevier commanded the men to attend the meeting, and he gave further instructions of the agreements to be made with the Georgian commissioners. Sevier wanted to make certain that both states would have an equal amount of work to do in constructing the road and reap an equal number of advantages from its existence.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written to Benjamin Hawkins, the Agent and Superintendent of the Creek Nation, by Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on December 20, 1807. Governor Sevier discusses the robbery and murder of two men from Tennessee, and that he suspects a member of the Creek Nation as the murderer. He asks the agent to investigate the situation and try to discover if a Creek Indian committed the murders. He claims that several parties of Creek Indians passed through the area of the killings around the same time and that these parties robbed and plundered several of the families in the area. Governor Sevier requests that the Creek chiefs put an end to the violence and migration of their people onto other lands.</description.1>

    <description.1>This document is a letter written by Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Black Fox, Chief of the Cherokee Nation, dated December 20, 1807. In the letter, Sevier acknowledges that it was the Creeks that murdered two white men and not the Cherokees, as was previously under investigation. Sevier also expresses his resentment and distrust for the Creek Nation, and he condemns the Cherokee for allowing Creeks to pass through and settle in their nation. Sevier encourages Black Fox not to let the Creek settle on their land since they rob and murder both the Cherokee and the white people in the area. He also adds that there have been complaints that some Cherokees have robbed and threatened white settlers in the area, and he requests that they be punished and compensate the white settlers.</description.1>

    <description.1>The following document is the constitution drafted on July 24, 1827 that sparked the beginning of the modern Cherokee Nation. The document was a product of a Constitutional Convention of 1827, headed by John Ross, who was elected the first Chief of the Cherokee Nation when the constitution was put into effect the following year. In the constitution, which was largely patterned after the United States', the Cherokees referred to themselves as a sovereign entity and outlined three branches of government. Although the Constitution of the Cherokee Nation was largely developed in order to prevent the forced removal of the Cherokee, it was only ten years after its adoption that the Cherokee were ultimately displaced.</description.1>

    <description.1>The following document is a Military Order issued on May 17, 1838, by General Winfield Scott, federal officer in charge of Cherokee removal. Scott issued, on the authority of President Andrew Jackson, the order for federal troops to enforce the removal of all the Cherokee remaining east of the Mississippi River, according to the terms of the Treaty of New Echota, signed by a Cherokee minority in 1835. Scott divided the Cherokee Nation into three military districts in order to facilitate a speedy evacuation. The orders of President Jackson and General Scott began what was to be called the Trail of Tears, in which 15,000-20,000 Cherokee were exiled to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. An estimated one-fifth died during the whole of the journey, which lasted until the spring of 1839.</description.1>

In the letter, Edward discusses the events taking place with his sister, Mary, at her school. He writes to their parents how unhappy she is there, and that she has not written home because she does not like her teacher, Mr. Anderson, to read her letters before she sends them. Edward tells them that the teacher will not send her letters if she writes something disagreeable to him, and has threatened her with expulsion if she does not act better and do as he wishes. Edward concludes the letter by describing what he has been doing at Hanover College and about the social events at the school and in Hanover.</description.1>
