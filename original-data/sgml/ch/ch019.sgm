McKenney, of the Department of War, dated April 29, 1824.  The delegation communicates a number of issues to McKenney from Principal Chiefs Charles R. Hicks and Path Killer.  The bulk of the letter relates to the misconduct and abusive behavior of Joseph McMinn, U.S. agent to the Cherokees, and former Governor of Tennessee (1815-1821).  In particular, McMinn had allowed unauthorized whites to settle in the Cherokee Nation, in violation of numerous treaties, and refused to prosecute them when they committed depredations within the Nation.  They also discuss payment for improvements and claims under the treaties of 1817 and 1819, and the boundary line along the Unicoi Turnpike.</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="repository">The Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="collection">State Library Cherokee Collection</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="box"> 1</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="folder"> 23</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="document">ch019</NOTE></BIBL></SOURCEDESC></FILEDESC><ENCODINGDESC><PROJECTDESC><P>Prepared for The University of Tennessee Digital Library</P></PROJECTDESC><EDITORIALDECL><P>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</P><P>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with Microsoft Word spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</P><P>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</P><P>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed. </P><P>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</P></EDITORIALDECL><REFSDECL><P>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points</P></REFSDECL><CLASSDECL><TAXONOMY ID="LCSH"><BIBL><TITLE>Library of Congress Subject Headings</TITLE></BIBL></TAXONOMY></CLASSDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><TEXTCLASS><KEYWORDS SCHEME="LCSH"><LIST><ITEM>Letters</ITEM><ITEM>McMinn, Joseph, 1758-1824</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Nation</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Treaties</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Claims</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Land tenure</ITEM><ITEM>Boundaries</ITEM><ITEM>Tennessee</ITEM></LIST> </KEYWORDS></TEXTCLASS></PROFILEDESC></TEIHEADER><TEXT><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="letter"><PB N="[1]"><OPENER><DATELINE><ADDRESS><ADDRLINE><NAME TYPE="place">Washington City</NAME> <NAME TYPE="place">Tennison's Hotel</NAME></ADDRLINE></ADDRESS><DATE VALUE="1824-04-29">April 29th. 1824</DATE></DATELINE><LB><ADDRESS><ADDRLINE>To <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel Thomas">Colo.

Hicks</NAME> the two principle chiefs of our Nation contains the information at present in our power to submit in relation to the charges, but no <ADD PLACE="supralinear">doubt</ADD> the facts can be substantially established &mdash; To wit&mdash;<Q>We had anticipated a belief that the agent would have pursued the same course as his predecessor in cases of thefts &amp; <ORIG REG="robberies">robberys</ORIG> which may be committed on our people by citizens of the surrounding <PB N="[3]">States, in this belief however, we find we were disappointed, as in the case of <NAME TYPE="person">Cooweeskoowee</NAME> who has been robbed of his money, for when the person charged with <SIC CORR="the">the the</SIC> theft (<NAME TYPE="person">Daniel Rash</NAME>) was brought before the agent by our Light Horse and under the proofs addressed, it appeared that one other man <DEL TYPE="overstrike">named</DEL> by the name of <NAME TYPE="person">Thorn</NAME> was a party concerned in the theft, he would do nothing in the subject&mdash; and another instance in the case of the robbery of <NAME TYPE="person">Five Killer</NAME> of his negros, by <NAME TYPE="person">McCormick</NAME>&mdash; such are the proceedings of the Present Agent, that we are confident the Government  will never countenance such acts of her agents, for they are not calculated to inspire a confidence in an agent, but rather produce a distrust of his integrity to do justice to an injured party&mdash;</Q></P><P><NAME TYPE="person">McCormick</NAME> is the man who we intimated in our letter of the 25th <ABBR EXPAN="Ultimo" TYPE="suspension">Ulto</ABBR> we were informed instructions has been given by the Department of War to the Agent to institute suit against, but as to the truth of the information,<PB N="[4]">we are not apprised <ADD PLACE="top" CERT="appears to be different ink">"</ADD>&mdash;. In order that <DEL TYPE="overstrike"><UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR></DEL> any misunderstanding between the Nation and the Agent, as to the state of the fact, on the subject of the site for the agency be removed, we would <ADD PLACE="left" CERT="appears to be different ink"></ADD> be happy to be furnished with copies of <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Governor" TYPE="suspension">Govr</ABBR> McMinn</NAME>'s communications to the Department on the subject, so that our principal chiefs and himself may discover where the error lies, and that they may endeavor to understand each other better, hereafter&mdash; And so far as the 10th Article of the Treaty of <DATE VALUE="1798-00-00">1798</DATE> stipulates that <Q>The <NAME TYPE="place person">Cherokee Nation</NAME> agree, that the <HI>Agent</HI> who may be appointed to reside among them from time to time, shall have <ADD PLACE="supralinear">a</ADD> sufficient piece of ground allotted for <HI>his</HI> temporary use.</Q>  We assure you the nation is ever ready to comply with and should it be thought necessary, and it be the desire of the Agent , that the piece of ground deemed sufficient for <HI>his</HI> temporary use, be made definite, it  is a matter which himself and our principal chiefs most assuredly would not differ about, <PB N="[5]">provided his object is to use the grounds solely himself, and that no citizen of the  <NAME TYPE="place">U. States</NAME> unconnected with him as an agent, be permitted to settle on or cultivate the ground so allotted for <HI>his</HI> temporary use&mdash;.</P><P><Q>On the subject of claims for improvements and damages sustained by the <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokees</NAME> under the treaty of <DATE VALUE="1819-00-00">1819</DATE>, that the nation may be informed who have been compensated, you will please to furnish us with a complete list of the names of those who have been paid for their improvements  under the treaty of <DATE VALUE="1817-00-00">1817</DATE> &amp; <DATE VALUE="1819-00-00">1819</DATE>. As emigrants or otherwise, and the amounts paid &mdash; And also a list of the names of those who are now considered as holding life estate reservations under the provision of those Treaties</Q>&mdash;. We are happy to be informed that directions will be issued to the Agent to confer with our principal chiefs as to the location of the sub agent on<PB N="[6]">the <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME> frontier. We beg leave to give an extract of a letter <ABBR EXPAN="received" TYPE="suspension">recd</ABBR> from Mr. <NAME TYPE="person">Charles R. Hicks</NAME> on this subject, To wit. <Q><ABBR EXPAN="Although" TYPE="suspension">Altho'</ABBR> <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Colo.</ABBR> Turk</NAME> has been indefatigable in removing the intruders on the frontier of <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME>, I have been creditably informed that some of the intruders have already began to erect new buildings, since their houses and fencing had been burnt by <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Colo.</ABBR> Turk</NAME>'s Troops&mdash; from this it will appear that there will be no end <SIC CORR="to">to to</SIC> intrusions on that frontier of the Nation, unless the Government will place some such a character as <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Colo</ABBR> Turk</NAME> as a sub agent to keep them off in that quarter, but I am confident that the present sub agent would not answer for that station &mdash; when a favorable opportunity offer, lay this subject before the Secretary of War&mdash;</Q>. We would here embrace the opportunity of stating that we are <PB N="[7]"> almost constantly receiving information from our Nation, that the intruders are again encroaching on the <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokee</NAME> lands, as numerously as before they were removed by <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Colo.</ABBR> Turk</NAME> on the <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME> as well as on the <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME> and <NAME TYPE="place">Alabama</NAME>  frontiers&mdash; The causes appear obvious, they have from time to time been indulged to secure their crops, and their property was expressly forbidden by the Agent, as we are informed, from being confiscated or interrupted in any manner&mdash; if they were fully convinced that the intercourse law is to be rigidly enforced against them, they would soon cease in their encroachment after having experienced the consequences of its operation <DEL TYPE="overstrike">for</DEL> a few times in succession&mdash; a prompt and rigid measure would unquestionably save trouble and expense to the Government, restore tranquility, <PB N="[8]">and harmony on the frontiers between the whiteman &amp; the redman&mdash; The great mass of claims for stolen property which are constantly crowding your office under the aggressions of those intruders would be curtailed&mdash; in a word, it would <DEL TYPE="overstrike">effect</DEL> have all the desired effect of establishing such a state of things, as ought to exist between the Nation and the citizens of the frontier states &mdash; We therefore most earnestly solicit the Department to give special &amp; explicit instructions to our agent to enforce the intercourse law against them to the fullest extent, and to have them removed without delay. We pause for a moment, to read a letter just now <ABBR EXPAN="received" TYPE="suspension">recd</ABBR> by <NAME TYPE="person">Major Ridge</NAME> from <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Colo.</ABBR> Turk</NAME>, we discover from the contents of the letter much matter on the very subject we were writing when it came to hand, <PB N="[9]">without saying more on the subject, we lay the letter before you for perusal &mdash; from it you will see the situation of our Nation, by which you will be able to judge the very urgent necessity which imperiously call for the immediate attention and interposition of the <ABBR EXPAN="General" TYPE="suspension">Genl</ABBR> Government&mdash;.</P><P>It appears that you have misunderstood that part of our letter which relates to the boundary line from the <NAME TYPE="place">Unicoi Turnpike</NAME> road to the nearest main source of the <NAME REG="River" TYPE="place"><UNCLEAR>Chestestee</UNCLEAR></NAME>, We do not pretend to insist for more than the true literal construction as expressed in the Treaty stipulation, in relation to that boundary.
