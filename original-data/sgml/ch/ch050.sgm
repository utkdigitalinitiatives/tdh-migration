Nelson</NAME> was with a detachment of which that under <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Brooks</NAME> by which I was arrested, was only apart.  There I found the <NAME TYPE="person">Rev. Mr. Trott</NAME>, a methodist missionary who has a <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokee</NAME> family, and a <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokee</NAME> by the name of <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME>, <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME> was chained to the wall of the house by the neck &amp; had another chain around his <ORIG REG="ankle">ancle</ORIG>. He had been arrested on Tuesday, on the charge of digging for gold, chained the first night by the <ORIG REG="ankle">ancle</ORIG> only, the second &amp; third by the neck to the wall &amp; by the <ORIG REG="ankle">ancle</ORIG> to <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME>.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> was arrested on Wednesday &amp; taken on horseback about ten miles to where <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> then was.  He had been before arrested, &amp; was under bonds to answer at Court for the offence of residing in the nation without licence &amp; now was taken again, &amp; having committed the second offence by returning to his family while the cause was pending.  On Thursday, he &amp; <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME> were marched on foot 22 miles, to the place where I found them, <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME> being chained by the neck to the <ORIG REG="wagon">waggon</ORIG>. This manner of treatment, I suppose, was occasioned by his having resistance when arrested and afterwards attempted to escape.</P><P>When I was arrested, <NAME TYPE="person">Sergeant Brooks</NAME> enquired the state of my family, &amp; when told that <NAME TYPE="person">Mrs. Worcester</NAME> was still confined to her bed, remarked<PB N="[2]">that he regretted that <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> was not himself present, <SIC CORR="implying">implying implying</SIC>, as I understood him, that if he were, he probably would not arrest me under such circumstances.  When we arrived where <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> was, I requested <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Brooks</NAME>, to mention to him the state in which he found us, which he very readily promised to do, but certainly had not fulfilled his promise when I heard him say that I was to go on to Head Quarters ie. to this place.  Perceiving, therefore that the state of my family was not to be regarded, I said no more.</P><P>We were then marched on foot 22 miles to the same place from which <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> &amp; <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Proctor</NAME> were taken the day before,  <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME> being again chained to the <ORIG REG="wagon">waggon</ORIG>.  We had proceeded about three miles, When we met <ABBR EXPAN="Messieurs"> Messrs.</ABBR> <NAME REG="Mr." TYPE="person">McLeod</NAME> &amp; <NAME REG="Mr." TYPE="person">Wells</NAME>, <ORIG REG="two">tow</ORIG> Methodist clergymen, not residing within the charter of <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME>.  With leave of <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME>, they turned &amp; rode along some distance in our company.  In conversation, <DEL TYPE="erasure"><UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR></DEL> <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME> asked <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> whether he had been chained the <ORIG REG="preceding">preceeding</ORIG> night, &amp; being answered in the affirmative, asked if it were according to law to chain a prisoner who manifested no disposition to escape.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> said he thought not, but that we ought not to blame those under <ORIG REG="whose">who</ORIG> charge we were, as they were obliged to act according to orders.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr McLeod</NAME> remarked <Q>It seems they proceed more by orders than by laws</Q> This gave offence.  A few words had passed between <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME> &amp; some of the guard, when <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> rode up &amp; being told of the remark, asked <NAME TYPE="person">Mr.  McLeod</NAME> where he <UNCLEAR>rides</UNCLEAR>.  He replied <UNCLEAR>to</UNCLEAR> <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME>.  <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME>, with a curse, ordered him to <Q>flank of</Q> Mr.<PB N="[3]"> <NAME REG="Mr." TYPE="person">McLeod</NAME>, turning his horse, said I will sir, if it your command" but added, hastily as he afterwards said <Q>You will hear from me again.</Q>  He was then riding away, when the Col. ordered him to halt, &amp; then to dismount &amp; lead his horse along in the rear.  He then inquired of <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> whether this was one of their circuit riders"  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> answered <Q>yes</Q>  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME>'s horse was then taken from him &amp; delivered to <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Wells</NAME>, and he was declared a prisoner &amp; ordered to walk on with the rest.  For a short distance, <NAME TYPE="person">Brooks</NAME> compelled him to keep the center of the road, through mire &amp; water threatening to thrust him through with the<ORIG REG="bayonet"> bayonette</ORIG> if he turned aside.  In the meantime he was heaping upon all our heads a load of tremendous curses, &amp; reviling missionaries and all ministers of the Gospel in language, which for profaneness and obscenity, could not be exceeded.  The words of our Savior he turned into ridicule &mdash;  <ADD PLACE="supralinear">"Fear not- said he tauntingly </ADD> Fear not" little flock, for it is you Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."  The manner in which these words were uttered did not prevent me, at least from rejoicing in the consolation they afford. &mdash; <NAME TYPE="person">Brooks</NAME> was the chief speaker, &amp; exceeded all, though some others joined him in his <ORIG REG="revelings">revilings</ORIG>.</P><P>Another circumstance afterwards occurred, which was related to me by <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Thompson</NAME>, who was eye witness.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Wells</NAME>, after <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME>'s arrest, pursued his journey in the opposite direction till he met <NAME TYPE="person">Mr Thompson</NAME> riding in the same direction with the guard.  He then turned &amp; rode in company with Mr. T. intending to see what should become of <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME>, &amp; to render him any assistance in his power.  After some time they came up with the guard.  When <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> saw <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Wells</NAME>, he ordered him to ride<PB N="4">out of his sight either before or behind, threatening violence if he did not.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Wells</NAME>, without replying fell back a little &amp; followed on.  <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> cut a stick and making up to <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Wells</NAME> gave him a severe blow on the head.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Wells</NAME> then said he had a right to travel the public road &amp; should do it.  He persevered accordingly &amp; rode on till he came to a house where <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME> requested him to stop.  I know not what offence <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Wells</NAME> had given, unless that, in conversation with me, he had expressed strong disapprobation of the policy of the state of <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME>, &amp; the course pursued by the Executive of the <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>.</P><P>Towards the end of our days Journey, <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME> was afflicted with a severe pain in the hips &amp; knees, to which he had been subject, &amp; requested the privilege of riding.  <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> sent him answer, that <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME> at first thought that he could not walk, but afterwards got along very well.</P><P><ORIG REG="At">A</ORIG> night the four prisoners were chained together by their <ORIG REG="ankle">ancle</ORIG> in pairs.</P><P>Some time after we lay down, a small detachment arrived with <NAME TYPE="person">Doctor Butler</NAME>.  He had been arrested at <NAME TYPE="place">Haweis</NAME> on the <ORIG REG="preceding">preceeding</ORIG> day.  After crossing a river three or four miles from home, a chain was fastened by a padlock around his neck, and at the other end to the neck of a horse, by the side of which he walked  Night soon came on.  The horse was kept walking at a quick pace, and <NAME TYPE="person">Doctor Butler</NAME> unable to see any obstruction which a rough<PB N="[5]">road might present, and liable at any moment to fall, and so to be dragged by the neck till the horse should stop.  After walking some distance in the dark, on representing the danger of his situation, he was taken up behind the saddle, his chain being still fastened to the horse's neck, &amp; short enough to keep his neck close to the shoulder of the guard.  In this situation the horse fell both his riders fell under him, and neither the horse nor either of the men could rise, till others could come and, after ascertaining their situation by the sense of feeling, roll the horse over.  <NAME TYPE="person">Dr. Butler</NAME> was considerably hurt, but the soldier none, having two ribs broken.  After this, till they came to their lodgings, <NAME TYPE="person">Dr. Butler</NAME> was permitted to ride, while a soldier walked.  In the mean time they lost their way in the woods.  However, they found a pine knot, of which they made a torch by striking fire; and by this means recovered their way.  Their lodging place was only 11 miles from <NAME TYPE="person">Dr. Butlers</NAME>, but it was midnight when they arrived, well drenched with rain.  When they lay down, the prisoner was chained to his bedstead by the <ORIG REG="ankle">ancle</ORIG> the officer, however, putting a handkerchief around under the chain.  The next day they had 35 miles or more to travel.  <NAME TYPE="person">Dr. Butler</NAME> wore the chain on his neck, but no longer fastened to a horse.  He was occasionally permitted to ride, one or another of the soldier's walking in his stead.  At night he was chained to <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME> and me.</P><P>On Friday morning we had to cross the <NAME TYPE="place">Hightower river</NAME> in boat.  As the prisoners, with a part of the guard, were crossing<PB N="[6]"><NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Thompson</NAME> was observed on the opposite side waiting to speak with us.  At the same time <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> &amp; <NAME TYPE="person">Sergeant Brooks</NAME> were observed in conversation.  <NAME TYPE="person">Brooks</NAME> then called to those who were with us, charging them that no person should be allowed to speak with a prisoner privately, and no letter to be delivered unexamined.  <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME> was now mounted on his own horse (which had been taken as a prize when he was arrested) wearing a chain, as <NAME TYPE="person">Dr. Butler</NAME> had worn it the day before.  He had a bag of clothes for a saddle, and a rope halter instead of a bridle.  No other one was chained.  When we had travelled a considerable distance, four of the soldiers were so kind as to walk four or five miles &amp; allow the prisoners to ride for which we were told they were afterwards abused by <NAME TYPE="person">Brooks</NAME>, who now had the command of the detachment.  <NAME TYPE="person">Col. Nelson</NAME> having parted from them.  Afterwards <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME>, being likely to fail , was mounted on <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME>'s horse in his stead.  Still later <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME>, having become so lame that he could scarcely walk, solicited the privilege of riding, <NAME TYPE="person">Brooks</NAME> with much cursing compelled him to walk on.  Afterwards, however, he ordered <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> to dismount, and placed <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME> in his stead.  Our days journey was 35 miles</P><P>At night only <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME> was chained.  <NAME TYPE="person">Brooks</NAME> having retired without giving any orders, on the subject, and the officer who had the charge of us not being disposed to chain us. </P><PB N="[7]"><P>The sabbath came &amp; we had 22 miles to travel.  Remonstrance would <ORIG REG="only">on</ORIG> have irritated.  We were under the command of armed men, &amp; must travel on.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. McLeod</NAME> being utterly unable to walk, was  mounted on <NAME TYPE="person">Proctor</NAME>'s horse.  <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Trott</NAME> was allowed to ride part of the way in the <ORIG REG="wagon">waggon</ORIG> and <NAME TYPE="person">Dr. Butler</NAME>  &amp; myself two or three miles on horse back.</P><P>Arrived here, we were, as a matter of course, marched into camp under sound of fife and drum.
