That the President of the <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME> knew nor recognized no Division of the <NAME TYPE="place person">Cherokee Nation</NAME>; nor will any division be noticed by your Father the President <ORIG REG="until">untill</ORIG> the Enumeration is taken and the Annuities apportioned between the <PB N="[8]">Arkansas and those who may remain East of the <NAME REG="River" TYPE="place">Mississippi</NAME>.</P><P>His Excellency then proceeded to read the Treaty as ratified by the President and the Senate of the <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>; and explained to them such parts as he had been advised they did not understand requesting them to ask or propound any question growing out of the Treaty that might facilitate its <ORIG REG="elucidation">illucidation</ORIG>, hoping (he added) that none would leave this place without an expression of their minds upon any clause or article of the Treaty they did not clearly understand; as it would give him the greatest pleasure to remove any <ORIG REG="obstacles">obsticles</ORIG> that lay in the way of a plain and correct understanding of the Treaty.</P><P>Amongst others of less importance <NAME TYPE="person">Walter Adair</NAME> (one of the natives) propounded the follow questions (to wit) 1st are any persons or person entitled by the Treaty to reservation Except the head of an Indian Family. 2ndly  If a person who has taken a reservation removes to any other part of the Old Nation<PB N="[9]">will the land reserved revert to the <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME> in the same manner as if he were to remove to the <NAME TYPE="place">Arkansas</NAME>.  3rdly with whom will persons taking reservations be Enumerated with those who remain in the Old Nation or those who remove to the <NAME TYPE="place">Arkansas</NAME>. (These questions grew out of the 3rd and eighth Articles of the Treaty)</P><P>To which <ORIG REG="interrogatories">interogatories</ORIG> his Excellency made the following answers &mdash; To the 1st he ans<GAP DESC="wer" REASON="document damaged">ed negatively, that none were entitled to take reservation under the treaty but the heads of Indian families.  The second question he answered in the affirmative that a removal from the land reserved would be by the terms of the Treaty an abandonment of <GAP REASON="document damaged"> To the third question he answered, that he conceived those taking reservations ought not to be Enumera<GAP DESC="ted" REASON="document damaged"> with either, as it is upon the express condition <DEL TYPE="overstrike">of becoming of</DEL> becoming Citizens that they are authorized to take reservations; and of course <ORIG REG="cannot">can not</ORIG> belong to the <NAME TYPE="place">Ark<GAP DESC="an" REASON="document damaged">sas</NAME> or the Old Nation; whence then the reason for Enumerating them with either.  And <ORIG REG="suppose">supose</ORIG> there are of<PB N="[10]">the Old Nation 5000 who wish to remain East of the <NAME REG="River" TYPE="place">Mississippi</NAME> and 5000 of the <NAME TYPE="place">Arkansas</NAME> and 440 persons who have taken reservations.  Place these reserves on part of the <NAME TYPE="place">Arkansas</NAME>, and when the division of the land takes place you will be leasing the quantity of land allowed to those reserves more than is right out of the Old Nation.  On the other hand suppose them added to the Old Nation to be Enumerated: you  will be taking from the <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME> a like quantity of Land, which in my opinion <ADD PLACE="supralinear">(he added)</ADD> would be extremely unjust in either case and contrary to what ever was contemplated by the Treaty.  Therefore taking it upon every ground upon which it could be placed, he was of Opinion that they ought not to be Enumerated with either.</P><P>The treaty having been read and explained throughout the Council adjourned to meet <ORIG REG="tomorrow">to morrow</ORIG> of the usual signal</P><P>Tuesday <DATE VALUE="1818-05-26">May the 26th 1818</DATE></P><P>His Excellency <ADD PLACE="supralinear">met</ADD> the Chiefs and warriors in the <PB N="[11]">council House according to Adjournment.</P><P><NAME TYPE="person">Thomas Foreman</NAME> a native stated that he did not believe that the <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokees</NAME> had a right to take reservations until the Enumeration is taken   To which his Excellency Answered that it would give him great pleasure at any time to answer any question that might be asked upon any point growing out of the treaty that might appear ambiguous or difficult, But that he conceived the suggestion of <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Foreman</NAME> as <UNCLEAR> aimed</UNCLEAR> at the treaty essentially, and requiring no explanation</P><P>The council then adjourned until <ORIG REG="tomorrow">to morrow</ORIG> at the usual signal for meeting</P><P>Wednesday <DATE VALUE="1818-05-27">May the 27th 1818</DATE></P><P>His Excellency met the Chiefs and warriors in the Council House according to adjournment and stated to them that he would call their attention to a talk he had written to deliver to them <ORIG REG="embracing">imbracing</ORIG> the most material points relative to the matter under investigation from the<PB N="[12]">commencement of the Treaty up to this time.
