It is also indispensable that the Establishment should be fixed within the limits of those Indian nations, which border on our settlements.  Such associations, or individuals, who are already actually Engaged in Educating the Indians, &amp; who may desire the cooperation of the government, will report to the Department of war, to be laid before the President, the location of the institutions under their superintendence, their funds, the number &amp; kind of teachers, the number of youths of both sexes, the objects which are actually embraced in their plan of education, &amp; the Extent of the aid which they require; and such institutions as are formed, but have not gone into actual operation, will report the extent of their funds, the places at which they intend to make their Establishments, the whole number of youths of both sexes<PB N="[2]">which they intend to Educate, the number &amp; kind of teachers to be Employed, the plan of Education adopted, &amp; the extent of the aid required.  This information will  be necessary to Enable the President to determine whether the appropriation of congress ought to be applied in cooperation with the institutions which may request it, and to make a just distribution of the sum appropriated.</P><P>In proportion to the means of the government, cooperation will be Extended to such institutions as may be approved, as well in Erecting the necessary buildings as in their current expenses.</P></DIV1></BODY></TEXT></TEI.2>
