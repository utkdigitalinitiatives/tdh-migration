Among these chieftains, the late <NAME TYPE="person">Charles Hicks</NAME>, and <NAME TYPE="person">John Ross</NAME>, now at the head of the nation, were preeminent. Under their directing councils, and aided by the policy of the general government, they have outstripped all the other tribes in the march of improvement.</P><P>The natives carry on considerable trade with the adjoining states, and some of <ORIG REG="them">they</ORIG> carry their cotton down the <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME>, and even down the <NAME REG="River" TYPE="place">Mississippi</NAME> to <NAME TYPE="place">New Orleans</NAME>.
