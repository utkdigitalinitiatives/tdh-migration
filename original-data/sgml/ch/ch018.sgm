Meigs, U.S. agent to the Cherokees at Southwest Point in Tennessee, dated April 30, 1802.  Roane reports that  two white men killed a Creek Indian in Jackson County (Tennessee) and the nearby inhabitants fear reprisal from the Indians.  He also advises Meigs to warn the Indians in his area not to hunt near Jackson County, as the local inhabitants are  alarmed.  Roane assures Meigs he will conduct an inquiry into the murder and seek punishment for the perpetrators.  Another letter from Roane on this topic also appears in the Southeastern Native American Documents Database as <XREF>ch017</XREF>.</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="repository">The Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="collection">State Library Cherokee Collection</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="box">1</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="folder"> 22</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="document">ch018</NOTE></BIBL></SOURCEDESC></FILEDESC><ENCODINGDESC><PROJECTDESC><P>Prepared for The University of Tennessee Digital Library</P></PROJECTDESC><EDITORIALDECL><P>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</P><P>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with Microsoft Word spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</P><P>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</P><P>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed. </P><P>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</P></EDITORIALDECL><REFSDECL><P>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points</P></REFSDECL><CLASSDECL><TAXONOMY ID="LCSH"><BIBL><TITLE>Library of Congress Subject Headings</TITLE></BIBL></TAXONOMY></CLASSDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><TEXTCLASS><KEYWORDS SCHEME="LCSH"><LIST><ITEM>Letters</ITEM><ITEM>Creek Indians--Crimes against</ITEM><ITEM>Creek Indians--Government relations</ITEM><ITEM>Tennessee</ITEM></LIST> </KEYWORDS></TEXTCLASS></PROFILEDESC></TEIHEADER><TEXT><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="letter"><PB N="[1]"><OPENER><DATE VALUE="1802-04-30">30th April 1802</DATE><SALUTE>Dear Sir, </SALUTE></OPENER><P>I have lately heard the disagreeable news that on the <DATE VALUE="1802-04-21">21st of this month</DATE> a <NAME TYPE="person">Creek</NAME> Indian was killed in <NAME TYPE="place">Jackson County</NAME> not far from <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Blackburn</NAME>'s by two men of the names <NAME TYPE="person">Richmond</NAME> and <NAME TYPE="person">Erwin</NAME>.
