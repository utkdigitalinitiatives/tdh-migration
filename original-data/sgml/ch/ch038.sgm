We need not trouble you with a long introduction, as there are several documents in your <DEL TYPE="overstrike"><UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR></DEL> department relative to the general subject of this communication.</P><P>Permit us to observe, however, that the society in whose behalf we speak, entertains the most large &amp; liberal designs; that its members reside in seven states of the union, &amp; the only reason why they are not found in every state is the impracticability of their meeting to transact business, if so widely dispersed; that it has patrons &amp; friends in all the states of the union; that its members are not confined to any religious denomination; that it disowns <ADD PLACE="supralinear">all</ADD> narrow, local or party views, &amp; seeks to do good by aiding in the moral improvement of our fellow-men, whereever accessible, who have not yet enjoyed the blessings of civilization &amp; christianity; that it regards with peculiar interest the wants of the Aborigines within our own borders; that it acknowledges with gratitude the favorable regards &amp; the important aid of government; &amp; that it will not solicit the patronage of government for any object, to which the members of the society are not ready to contribute their property, their time &amp; their <ORIG REG="labor">labour</ORIG>.<PB N="[2]">Permit us to add, that <ADD PLACE="supralinear">as</ADD> the various concerns of the board are becoming weighty both on account of the expense &amp; responsibility attached to them, &amp; as prudence, circumspection &amp; economy are highly necessary the committee &amp; other agents of the board will not make any communications to government without great care and deliberation.</P><P>After these remarks we would respectfully enquire <HI>1st</HI> whether the government may not with propriety give further assurances, that, in case the Indian title to the land on which our schools are &amp; shall be established, should, hereafter, be extinguished, the Board shall enjoy the land occupied &amp; improved by them, it being understood, that all the avails &amp; profits of such tenements shall be applied solely to the benevolent objects for which the board was formed?  It is proper to state here, that it is a favorite plan of the Committee to exhibit a favorable &amp; thorough specimen of agriculture before the eyes of the Indians, and to cultivate all the grains, grasses &amp; fruits which are suited to the various climates of our stations.  For these purposes, &amp; to prevent annoyance from near <ORIG REG="neighbors">neighbours</ORIG>, probably no man would think a mile square too great a reservation.  This enquiry will be deemed proper when it is considered, that great expense has been already incurred in improving the farm among the <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokees</NAME> &amp; similar expenses are contemplated at other stations.</P><P><HI><ABBR EXPAN="2ndly">2dly</ABBR></HI> Will <ADD PLACE="supralinear">not</ADD> the government supply a greater number of implements of husbandry &amp; of domestic manufacture, than have as yet been promised?</P><P>At the school among the <NAME TYPE="person">cherokees</NAME>, there are already<PB N="[3]">more than twenty boys, who can handle the hoe &amp; the axe, very dexterously.</P><P><HI><ABBR EXPAN="3rdly">3dly</ABBR></HI> As it is found desirable to give some promising Indian youths a more thorough education, than they can receive in their own tribes, &amp; to give them a fair &amp; full view of the benefits of civilized society, will not the government bear a moderate part of the expense of their journey &amp; residence for this purpose?</P><P>Four youths of this description are now under our care in this city, on their way to an excellent school, designed gratuitously for their benefit &amp; the benefit of others in similar circumstances.  <ADD PLACE="bottom">As a particular amount of these youths, has already been given to this Department by one of us, it is not necessary to repeat the account here.</ADD></P><P><HI>4thly</HI>  Will not the government assist in the erection a a corn mill near each station, provided it can be done at a moderate expense, with the approbation of the public agent, &amp; with a prospect of success?</P><P>So important is a Mill to the comfort of the family and schools, that the Board have already expended five hundred dollars in building one among the <NAME TYPE="person">cherokees</NAME>.  It was not quite completed on the <DATE VALUE="0000-06-01">1st of June last</DATE>.</P><P><HI>5thly</HI> Should the board feel able to comply with the earnest  desire of the emigrants to the <NAME TYPE="place">Arkansas</NAME> &amp; send a Mission  family &amp; school master thither, as soon as possible, will not the government afford some extraordinary aid, particularly as the </P><PB N="[4]"><P>distance is great, the passage circuitous &amp; expensive, &amp; the obtaining of supplies difficult?</P><P>Expressing a confident opinion that the civil &amp; moral improvement of the Indians will promote the true policy, the interest, and the dignity of the <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>,</P><CLOSER><SALUTE>we are Sir, With sentiments of great respect and consideration, your obedient servants</SALUTE> (Signed)<SIGNED><NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Jeremiah">Jerh.</ABBR> Evarts</NAME></SIGNED><SIGNED><NAME TYPE="person">Elias Cornelius</NAME></SIGNED></CLOSER></DIV1></BODY></TEXT></TEI.2>
