Believing that the General welfare of the Country would not be promoted by the opening of mines of valuable minerals which would serve the purpose of attracting a large number of persons to the Country not responsible to its laws or amenable to its authorities, I am opposed to entering upon the subject at all at this time.

If mines of ordinary richness exist in the Country the privileges <DEL TYPE="overstrike">proposed</DEL> <UNCLEAR>conferred</UNCLEAR> by the Bill are enormous and greater than should be conferred upon a company &mdash; The second section of the Bill confers a large jurisdiction upon the District Courts, a wide discretion upon <DEL TYPE="overstrike">its</DEL> the Judges of those Courts and confines its powers in <DEL TYPE="overstrike">to</DEL> determining <DEL TYPE="overstrike">the</DEL> question of priority in the <PB N="[2]">"registration" of a mine without providing for the settlement of Controversies arising as to the priority of their <HI>discovery</HI>&mdash; the only <DEL TYPE="overstrike">only</DEL> one that could be productive of a <DEL TYPE="overstrike"><UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR></DEL> controversy that would not be settled by a simple reference to the register in <DEL TYPE="overstrike">the</DEL> the <UNCLEAR>judges</UNCLEAR> <DEL TYPE="overstrike"><UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR></DEL> office &mdash; <DEL TYPE="overstrike">And for <UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR></DEL> The  <UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR> to be allowed the Nation, the Method of its collection and the compensation <DEL REND="overstrike">for</DEL> of the Supervising Agents are not such as are calculated to avoid confusion and inefficiency.</P><P>For these reasons and others which will doubtless suggest themselves to your minds on more mature reflection, I respectfully withhold my signature from the Bill</P><CLOSER><SIGNED><NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="John">Jno</ABBR> Ross</NAME></SIGNED></CLOSER></DIV1></BODY></TEXT></TEI.2>
