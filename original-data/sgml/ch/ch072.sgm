Campbell and James Meriwether, dated October 27, 1823.  The Council rebuts a number of unfounded accusations made by the commissioners in a recent talk they delivered.  The Cherokee Council explains that they have no more land to sell and thus, negotiating a treaty for further land cessions would be useless.  They refer to the Treaty of Holston and numerous other treaties in developing their argument.  The talk is signed by a number of important Cherokee leaders including Pathkiller, Major Ridge, and John Ross.</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="repository">The Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="collection">State Library Cherokee Collection</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="box">3</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="folder">5</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="document">ch072</NOTE></BIBL></SOURCEDESC></FILEDESC><ENCODINGDESC><PROJECTDESC><P>Prepared for The University of Tennessee Digital Library</P></PROJECTDESC><EDITORIALDECL><P>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</P><P>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with Microsoft Word spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</P><P>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</P><P>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed. </P><P>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</P></EDITORIALDECL><REFSDECL><P>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points</P></REFSDECL><CLASSDECL><TAXONOMY ID="LCSH"><BIBL><TITLE>Library of Congress Subject Headings</TITLE></BIBL></TAXONOMY></CLASSDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><TEXTCLASS><KEYWORDS SCHEME="LCSH"><LIST><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Treaties</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Land tenure</ITEM><ITEM>Southern States</ITEM></LIST> </KEYWORDS></TEXTCLASS></PROFILEDESC></TEIHEADER><TEXT><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="letter"><PB N="[1]"><OPENER><DATELINE><ADDRESS><ADDRLINE><NAME TYPE="place">Newtown</NAME></ADDRLINE></ADDRESS><DATE VALUE="1823-10-27"><ABBR EXPAN="October">Octr.</ABBR> 27th 1823</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>In General Council<LB> Friends Brothers,</SALUTE></OPENER><P>You say that your anticipations of success was founded upon, Confidence in any judgement, and that you believed &amp; hoped you would have succeeded in Convincing us that you were right, and would also satisfy us of the nature of our title to the soil which we now occupy.
