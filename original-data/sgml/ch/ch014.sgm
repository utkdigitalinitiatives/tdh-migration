I was much gratified to find that you &amp; your Indian friends had the entire disposal of this important matter- this arrangement will <UNCLEAR>resound</UNCLEAR> equally to the honor of <NAME REG="Winfield" TYPE="person">General Scott</NAME> &amp; the government &amp; to the comfort &amp; I trust, satisfaction of the <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokees</NAME>, under the trying &amp; painful circumstances, in which, all have been placed.  I congratulate you therefore &amp; your friends, upon the happy determination of this branch of the subject.</P><P>I have now a proposition to make, to which I invite your serious consideration &amp; that of your <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokee</NAME> friends.  On establishing yourselves in the West, you will, besides subsistence, necessarily require for the use of all your people, a great quantity &amp; variety of articles necessary to their comfort &amp; well being- Such as woolens &amp; cottons, for clothes- blankets- hardware of all sorts- glass- agricultural implements- mechanics tools- groceries- arms &amp; powder <ABBR EXPAN="et cetera et cetera">&amp;c &amp;c</ABBR>- all these can in greater or lesser quantities, be doubtless bought, in the West, from Merchants &amp; Traders; who foreseeing your wants may have goods ready to supply them.  These goods will have been<PB N="[2]">originally purchased in the Northern Cities, and probably, have passed <ORIG REG="through">thro</ORIG> several hands, each charging a profit, before they reach your people, the consumers. of course under such circumstances they must be bought by the consumers at prices very far above the original cost &amp; transportation to the point of delivery-&amp; such goods would in all probability be generally of inferior qualities.  Instead of relying upon such a source, would it not be better to make your purchases directly from this section of the Country?  &amp; to have the goods sent by way of <NAME TYPE="place">New Orleans</NAME> to such designated points, in your <NAME TYPE="place">Arkansas</NAME> Country, as might be accessible by water &amp; most convenient to you?  Should <DEL TYPE="overstrike">such</DEL> <ADD PLACE="supralinear">this</ADD> proposition meet the approbation of your friends &amp; yourself, I have to offer my services to carry it into effect- as to the business part of it.  I understand it perfectly &amp; I trust you will believe that I will do it honorably &amp; justly- &amp; so far as protection from the Government may be required (should such be the case, as it may be) I think I can say, it will, at my request, be given when necessary to secure the safe transportation of <ADD PLACE="supralinear">the</ADD> goods to your people.  In all cases it will be necessary that your orders should state fully &amp; in detail the quality &amp; quantity of each description of goods wanted- the places to which they are to be sent &amp; the time of delivery at those places- <ORIG REG="accommodating">accomodating</ORIG> the time of delivery, of course, to the proper periods for navigating the rivers to be ascended.  as to funds- with proper guarantee, I can raise any amount required- so that you need advance nothing- when I say proper guarantee, I mean such security as the<PB N="[3]">Banks would be satisfied with - or should the goods, be bought on credit, as would probably be the case, such security as would satisfy the Importers from whom purchased- as for instance, orders <DEL TYPE="overstrike"><UNCLEAR></UNCLEAR></DEL> <ADD PLACE="supralinear">or</ADD> drafts upon the Secretary of War <ABBR EXPAN="Commissioners" TYPE="contraction">Comsr</ABBR>- of Indian affairs or other proper Officers accepted by him, to be payable on delivery of the goods at some designated point in <NAME TYPE="place">Arkansas</NAME> or elsewhere- or any other mode by which payment would be secured-  I have to invite again your earnest attention to this subject not only in regard to the supplies that may be required by your own people, but by the Tribes around you, over whom, you and your friends, will undoubtedly exercise a great influence.  Such an arrangement would, I am persuaded be highly advantageous to the Indians, by securing for them the articles they may want on the lowest terms &amp; of the required quality- &amp; highly beneficial to me from the greatest extent of the operations.  <DEL TYPE="overstrike">The</DEL> the percentage of profit would be small.
