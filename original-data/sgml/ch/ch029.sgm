Hansell and Colonel Samuel Rockwell, lawyers for the Cherokee Nation, dated July 9, 1835.  Ross complains to the two attorneys regarding the controversy of the payment of the Cherokee annuity.  A vote is to be held under the direction of Major Benjamin F. Currey to determine to which Cherokee faction, the Ridge party or the Ross party, the annuity is to be paid.  Ross complains about slanderous depictions of him in local newspapers and also mentions the arrival of Reverend John F. Schermerhorn to submit treaty proposals to the Cherokees.</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="repository">The Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="collection">State Library Cherokee Collection</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="box"> 1</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="folder">23</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="document">ch029</NOTE></BIBL></SOURCEDESC></FILEDESC><ENCODINGDESC><PROJECTDESC><P>Prepared for The University of Tennessee Digital Library</P></PROJECTDESC><EDITORIALDECL><P>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</P><P>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with Microsoft Word spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</P><P>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</P><P>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed. </P><P>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</P></EDITORIALDECL><REFSDECL><P>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points</P></REFSDECL><CLASSDECL><TAXONOMY ID="LCSH"><BIBL><TITLE>Library of Congress Subject Headings</TITLE></BIBL></TAXONOMY></CLASSDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><TEXTCLASS><KEYWORDS SCHEME="LCSH"><LIST><ITEM>Letters</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Relocation</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Claims</ITEM><ITEM>Southern States</ITEM></LIST> </KEYWORDS></TEXTCLASS></PROFILEDESC></TEIHEADER><TEXT><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="letter"><PB N="[1]"><OPENER><DATELINE><ADDRESS><ADDRLINE><NAME TYPE="place">Red Clay</NAME> <NAME TYPE="place person"><ABBR EXPAN="Cherokee">C</ABBR> Nation</NAME></ADDRLINE></ADDRESS> <DATE VALUE="1835-07-09">July 9th. 1835.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>Gentlemen</SALUTE></OPENER><P>The Govt.
