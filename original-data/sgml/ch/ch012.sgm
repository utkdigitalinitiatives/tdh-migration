Martin and Ridge report to Ross on the progress of the Cherokee delegation in Washington and their decision to delay the delivery of the Cherokee Memorial to Congress.  They indicate that they have news of atrocities against the Cherokees in Georgia.  They further inform Ross that Elias Boudinot and John Ridge have met with Henry Clay who has pledged his support.  They lament the hypocrisy with which they are met in dealing with the U.S. government.  In addition, Martin and Ridge make reference to a delegation of Creek leaders also in Washington and comment on William Wirt's involvement in the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia.</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="repository">The Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="collection">State Library Cherokee Collection</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="box">1</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="folder"> 16</NOTE><NOTE TYPE="document">ch012</NOTE></BIBL></SOURCEDESC></FILEDESC><ENCODINGDESC><PROJECTDESC><P>Prepared for The University of Tennessee Digital Library</P></PROJECTDESC><EDITORIALDECL><P>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</P><P>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with Microsoft Word spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</P><P>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</P><P>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed. </P><P>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</P></EDITORIALDECL><REFSDECL><P>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points</P></REFSDECL><CLASSDECL><TAXONOMY ID="LCSH"><BIBL><TITLE>Library of Congress Subject Headings</TITLE></BIBL></TAXONOMY></CLASSDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><TEXTCLASS><KEYWORDS SCHEME="LCSH"><LIST><ITEM>Letters</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Violence against</ITEM><ITEM>Cherokee Indians--Government relations</ITEM><ITEM>Southern States</ITEM></LIST> </KEYWORDS></TEXTCLASS></PROFILEDESC></TEIHEADER><TEXT><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="letter"><PB N="[1]"><OPENER><DATELINE><ADDRESS><ADDRLINE><NAME TYPE="place">Washington City</NAME></ADDRLINE></ADDRESS><DATE VALUE="1831-12-28"> 28th Dec. 1831.</DATE></DATELINE><LB><SALUTE><NAME TYPE="person">John Ross</NAME> <ABBR EXPAN="Esquire" TYPE="suspension">Esqr.</ABBR><LB>Dear sir,</SALUTE></OPENER><P>The Delegation arrived here on the 20th instant &amp; have for the first time visited the War Department on this day.  <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Governor" TYPE="suspension">Gov.</ABBR> Cass</NAME> is unwell, &amp; therefore, we did not see him, but left word that a Communication, touching the affairs of the <NAME TYPE="place person">Cherokee Nation</NAME> would be sent for the consideration of the government.</P><P>We have on purpose delayed the memorial, which, is required of us to <DEL TYPE="overstrike">Congress</DEL> present to Congress, to see what the Legislature would do, (in <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME>) in regard to our Lands.
