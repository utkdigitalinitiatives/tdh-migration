As there is no game upon the lands, and I believe, no Indians settled upon it, but <name><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Lowry</name>, it would appear to be their interest to sell it for a fair consideration. By giving Lowry a present, equal to the value of his possessions, it is probable, that a purchase can be effected of all their lands to the north of the river. The President desires, that you shall make every exertion to obtain this cession at their next national council. To enable you to affect this, you are <orig reg="authorized">authorised</orig> to give them, either by way of annuity, or to be paid at one or more payments after the ratification, the sum of Twenty thousand dollars, and to distribute presents among them to the amount of five thousand dollars; and to Lowry, the value <add>of</add> <pb n="2"/> of his possessions north of the Tennessee river. It will be proper to ascertain the relative value of the lands belonging to Tennessee, compared with that in the <name>Mississippi</name> territory, as the state of Tennessee ought and must pay her proportion of it.</p><p><name>Major Walker</name>, in private conversation told me, that he thought the Cherokee nation would sell the land which we attempted to purchase last winter. It is deemed expedient to make the effort. You are therefore authorised to offer them for their claims to the lands lying west of a line to be run due south from that point on the Tennessee river which is intersected by the Eastern boundary of <name>Madison county</name>, to the line agreed upon by the late treaty, an annuity of six thousand dollars a year in perpetuity. Considering that the most of this land is claimed by the <name>Chickasaws</name>, and that there is little or no game upon it, there is some reason to believe, that this offer will not be rejected by the nation, in their grand council.</p><p>The President calculates upon the exercise of all your influence in effecting these objects. No commissioner will be appointed, as it is deemed inexpedient to make an impression upon them, that we are extremely solicitous to obtain the cessions in question. <pb n="3"/> question.</p><closer><salute>I have the honor to be, <lb/> Your most <abbr expan="obedient">obedt</abbr>. &amp; <lb/> very humble servant,</salute><signed><name><abbr expan="William Harris">Wm H.</abbr> Crawford</name></signed><address><addrLine><name><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr>.
