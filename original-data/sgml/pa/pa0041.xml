And also exhibiting the survey as made by the United States Surveyor Agreeably to your Order, in Consequence of <name>John Spears</name> setting up a claim for a life <add>estate</add> reservation.  And also the surveys made under the authority of the State of <name>Tennessee</name>  ,  by which you will discover the survey as made for John Spears <add>under your order</add> came in contact with a part of Lewis Ross' claim as seemed to him by Treaty. <pb n="[2]"/>   and that the reservation laid off for John Spears was sectioned off &amp; sold by State of Tennessee, in consequence of these circumstances, a part of Lewis Ross'  claim is involved by litigation with Spears and the State of Tennessee.  in addition  to the verbal statements made to you by Genl. Houston on the subject of Spears' claim for a reservation, I beg leave to lay before you <add>a copy of</add> his letter  to me on the subject_ And I am requested by Lewis Ross to say that when these facts are made known, that you will at once see that  he has been unjustly led into <add>useless</add> difficulties and expense by the representations made to the Department in favor of Spears' claim, and as it cannot be the intention of the Government to make the reservations of less value than contemplated by the parties under the provision of the Treaty stipulation, nor to subject them to unnecessary litigation in law,  it is confidently expected that you will reinvestigate the <pb n="[3]"/> subject in the end that the land reserved to him under the Treaty of 1819.  may be secured to him without further Trouble &amp; expense, or otherwise should the Government insist that Spears ought to have a reservation he would be willing to surrender his claim altogether provided the  Government would pay him a reasonable price for it; or else pay him the value of the difference of the land as secured to him by Treaty and as laid off for him by your Order in consequence of Spear's claim- these propositions I am directed to state, are made solely with the view and a desire to be freed from an unjust and an unnecessary law suit, produced by the Contravening claim allowed to Spears by the Government_ I therefore beg your early attention and decision of the subject.  I beg leave further to add that on my arrival in this City, I handed you a letter from <name><abbr expan="James">Jas.</abbr> Brown</name> in relation to <name>Charles McClung</name> instituting a suit against him for the land granted to him by reservation, <pb n="[4]"/> you will please to inform me whether the subject of that letter has been acted On, And the result_.</p><closer><salute>I have the honor to be Sir, <abbr expan="Your Very Obedient and Humble Servant">yr.
