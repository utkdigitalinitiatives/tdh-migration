			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This photograph of a drawing shows the posthole
				patterns of a Cherokee townhouse, summer pavilion, and large pit-features at
				Chota. Townhouses, or council houses, were large circular dome structures that
				served as an arena for all political and social events. The summer pavilion,
				which was open and rectangular in shape was used for the same purpose during
				warmer weather. Pits were dug for burials and for storage of refuse. The
				drawing is based on historical descriptions as well as archaeological
				excavations conducted by The University of Tennessee from 1969-1974. The
				excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little
				Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir under contract with the National
				Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator,
				Alfred K. Guthe. Field Directors, J. Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F.
				Schroedl.</NOTE>
