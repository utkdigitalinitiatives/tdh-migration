			 <NOTE TYPE="summary"> This photograph is of the Great Spring at the
				Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee. The Great
				Spring, also known as the Blue Hole Spring, is a natural spring that not only
				supplied the Cherokees who met here with potable water, but was also a sacred
				and spiritual place for them. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the
				Cherokee the right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with
				treaties that gave away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital
				from New Echota, Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because
				the state of Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together.
				Thus, Red Clay became the sear of the Cherokee government in 1832 and lasted
				until the removal of the Cherokees to the west in 1838. Red Clay was composed
				of 11 general councils and the meetings were attended by up to 5000 people. It
				was at Red Clay that the Cherokee learned that they had lost all of their land
				and would be removed to the west. Red Clay consists of the sacred Blue Hole
				Spring, a reconstructed council house, and several reconstructed homestead
				buildings. Red Clay is also the home to the Eternal Flame, lit on April 6,
				1984. The Cherokees took hot coals from their council fire at Ted Clay on the
				Trail of Tears. The flame was later taken to Cherokee, North Carolina in the
				1950s but was returned to Red Clay in 1984. This was the first symbolic step
				unifying the Eastern Cherokees with the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma since their
				removal in 1838. Today Red Clay State Historical Park is not only a historical
				site, but is also an interpretive site on the Trail of Tears.</NOTE>
