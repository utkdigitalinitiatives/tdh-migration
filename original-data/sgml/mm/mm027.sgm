			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a drawing of a late 18th century
				Cherokee domestic structure, based on historic descriptions and archaeological
				excavations by the University of Tennessee. This rectangular building is
				typical of a Cherokee summer home, which was usually built next to a conical
				winter house. Excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park
				Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in anticipation of the
				flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				drawing is by Thomas Whyte.</NOTE>
