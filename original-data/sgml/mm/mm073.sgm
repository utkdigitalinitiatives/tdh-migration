			 <NOTE TYPE="summary"> This photograph is of a reconstructed
				blockhouse and stockade wall at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of
				Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. The blockhouse is constructed from hewn
				logs and is one of four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort. The stockade was
				was first used as a defensive wall, but eventually was used to contain the
				Cherokees who were to be removed to the west. Fort Southwest Point was
				established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops
				that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the
				militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with
				the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier. During the years between
				1801-1807, the fort was established as the headquarter for the Cherokee Agency.
				In 1974, archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed
				portions of six fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall,
				and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department
				of Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of
				thirteen buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four
				blockhouses, and several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A
				complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings,
				bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a more
				detailed examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered
				several historic and prehistoric features. Additional excavations were
				conducted at Fort Southwest Point in the 1990s yielded new information as to
				the fort's original layout and functions, as well as the life ways of the
				people who occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was given to the city of
				Kingston by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is now used as a
				historical and recreational area.</NOTE>
