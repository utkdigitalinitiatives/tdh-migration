			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of posthole patterns of a
				Cherokee segmented domestic structure at the town of Tomotley in the Lower
				Little Tennessee River Valley. This structure dating back to the mid-18th
				century, although rectangular, appears to be more substantial than the typical
				summer dwelling. These sturdier structures that were often partitioned were
				discovered in Tomotley and Mialoquo in groups at angles to one another. It is a
				pattern similar to site patterning among the Creeks and Lower Cherokees and may
				reflect the presence of refugees settling in the Overhill country. Excavations
				of Tomotley were conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1976 as part of
				the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower
				Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were
				conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field
				Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</NOTE>
