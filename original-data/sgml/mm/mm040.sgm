			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of posthole patterns of
				mid-18th century summer and winter domestic dwellings from the Overhill
				Cherokee town of Citico. As was common in most Overhill villages winter houses
				were built in a circular dome structure which contained a central hearth for
				fire. Adjacent to the winter home was an open rectangular summer pavilion used
				in warm weather. Excavations were conducted by the University of Tennessee in
				1978 in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River by the
				Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the
				National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal
				investigator, Jefferson Chapman. Field Director, Robert D. Newman</NOTE>
