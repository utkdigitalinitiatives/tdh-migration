			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of a central hearth of a
				Cherokee townhouse from the Overhill village of Tomotley dating back to the
				mid-18th century. All political and social events were held in these large
				winter townhouses, which were cone-shaped and appeared to look like a small
				mountain from a distance. Some were large enough to hold 500 people. The seats
				were arranged like an amphitheater with the seats rising one above another,
				leaving an area in the center for a fire. Excavations of Tomotley were
				conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1976 as part of the Tellico
				Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little
				Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted
				under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley
				Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director,
				Gerald F. Schroedl</NOTE>
