			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of a 1974 Tennessee Valley
				Authority (TVA) survey crew mapping archaeological features at the former site
				of the mid-18th century Cherokee town of Chota. Chota was recognized by Native
				Americans and European settlers as a powerful social and economic influence and
				was regarded as the capital of the Cherokee nation. Excavations of Chota and
				other Overhill Cherokee villages were conducted as part of the Tellico
				Archaeological Project by the University of Tennessee in anticipation of the
				flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River Valley by the Tellico Dam
				Reservoir. The university worked under contract with the National Park Service
				and TVA. Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, Gerald F.
				Schroedl.</NOTE>
