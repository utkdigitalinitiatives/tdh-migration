			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This photograph shows the postholes of an 18th
				century domestic winter house at Chota, a former Overhill Cherokee village in
				what is today Monroe County. Winter houses were conical in shape with four
				central support posts and were generally about 30 feet in diameter and 15 feet
				high. Adjacent to these round winter homes was usually a rectangular building
				used for summer habitation. Excavations of Chota and other Overhill villages
				were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of
				the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower
				Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were
				conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field
				Director, J. Worth Greene</NOTE>
