			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a drawing of Fort Loudoun, a British
				colonial military post on the lower Little Tennessee River that was occupied
				from 1756-1760. It was built in Overhill Cherokee territory in what is
				presently Monroe County and named for John Campbell, the Earl of Loudoun, who
				was commander-in-chief of British forces in the colonies. William G. De Brahm
				designed the fort, but abandoned the project because of disagreements he had
				with Capt. Demerre who commanded the militia troops and British regulars
				stationed at the post. Survival of this frontier outpost was dependent upon
				good relations with the Cherokees who supplied food for trade goods. During the
				French and Indian War, tensions began to mount between the Cherokees and the
				colonists. In March 1760 the Cherokees laid siege to the fort, cutting off
				supplies and forcing its surrender. Excavations of Fort Loudoun were conducted
				by the University of Tennessee from 1975-1977 in anticipation of the flooding
				of the lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and
				the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator and Field
				Director, Carl Kutruff. </NOTE>
