			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a drawing depicting the central area of
				the Overhill Cherokee town of Chota around the mid-18th century. It shows a
				central village plaza with a large circular winter townhouse and a smaller
				rectangular summer townhouse. Both were used for public, social, and political
				events. Shown also are similar domestic dwellings with a circular winter house
				alongside a rectangular summerhouse. The drawing is based on historical
				descriptions as well as archaeological excavations conducted by The University
				of Tennessee from 1969-1974. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of
				the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir
				under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley
				Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Directors, J.
				Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F. Schroedl. The drawing is by Thomas
				Whyte.</NOTE>
