			 <NOTE TYPE="summary"> This photograph is of a reduced scale
				reconstruction of the Cherokee council house at the Red Clay site at Red Clay
				State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee. This reconstruction is of a summer
				council house, not the original house. The original council house would have
				been much larger in order to accommodate the nearly 5000 people who would have
				gathered there. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the
				right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave
				away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota,
				Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of
				Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together. Thus, Red Clay
				became the seat of the Cherokee government in 1832 and lasted until the removal
				of the Cherokees to the west in 1838. Red Clay was composed of 11 general
				councils and the meetings were attended by up to 5000 people. It was at Red
				Clay that the Cherokee learned that they had lost all of their land and would
				be removed to the west. Red Clay consists of the sacred Blue Hole Spring, a
				reconstructed council house, and several reconstructed homestead buildings. Red
				Clay is also the home to the Eternal Flame, lit on April 6, 1984. The Cherokees
				took hot coals from their council fire at Red Clay on the Trail of Tears. The
				flame was later taken to Cherokee, North Carolina in the 1950s but was returned
				to Red Clay in 1984. This was the first symbolic step unifying the Eastern
				Cherokees with the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma since their removal in 1838.
				Today Red Clay State Historical Park is not only a historical site, but is also
				an interpretive site on the Trail of Tears.</NOTE>
