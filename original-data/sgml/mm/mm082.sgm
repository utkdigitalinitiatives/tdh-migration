			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This is a computer generated map of an excavated
				unit at the Chattooga site. Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that
				was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village
				associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and
				western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been occupied for only 160
				years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s. This site is given
				special attention because it retained early 18th century Cherokee material
				culture. This material culture is difficult to find and distinguish on other
				Cherokee sites of the same time period. The University of Tennessee (UT) and
				the Francis Marion National Forest conducted archaeological excavations at
				Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus of these excavations was to develop a
				better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee occupation at the
				site and compare these findings with those found on other 18th century Cherokee
				sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists were able to identify
				and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed council houses. In
				addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one summer domestic
				structure were conducted. Through the use of surface collection, test pit
				excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the
				location of additional buildings and features were found with minimal
				disturbance to the site. The excavation of Chattooga is still an active
				research project with additional findings in the process of being
				documented.</NOTE>
