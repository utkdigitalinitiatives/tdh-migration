			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This photograph is of a painting of a mid-18th
				century Cherokee farmstead. The painting was based on historic descriptions and
				archaeological excavations from the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley,
				conducted by the University of Tennessee 1967-1982. Excavations of Overhill
				Cherokee Villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967
				and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued
				until 1983, and laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987.
				The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower
				Little Tennessee River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam
				Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park
				Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). </NOTE>
