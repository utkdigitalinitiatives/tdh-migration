			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This photograph is of unexcavated structural
				ruins at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane
				County, Tennessee. The ruins show that the structures were composed of stacked
				mortared and unmortared limestone blocks and, occasionally, river rocks. Fort
				Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the
				territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts
				of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals
				were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the
				frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as the
				headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from the
				University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building foundations,
				the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984
				excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and the City of
				Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These buildings
				include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several buildings that are
				believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the
				location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The
				excavation also produced a more detailed examination of the palisade and stone
				wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and prehistoric features.
				Additional excavations were conducted at Fort Southwest Point in the 1990s
				yielded new information as to the fort's original layout and functions, as well
				as the life ways of the people who occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was
				given to the city of Kingston by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is
				now used as a historical and recreational areal.</NOTE>
