			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This photograph is of a European manufactured
				iron hoe head traded to the Cherokees in the mid-18th century. It was recovered
				by the University of Tennessee during an excavation of the Overhill Cherokee
				village of Chota. Chota was recognized by Europeans as well as other Indians
				for its powerful economic influence and was regarded as the capital of the
				Cherokee nation. The Cherokees kept small vegetable plots near their homes as
				well as maintained large communal agricultural fields of beans, corn, and
				squash. Excavations of Chota and other Overhill villages were conducted by the
				University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico
				Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little
				Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted
				under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley
				Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J.
				Worth Greene.</NOTE>
