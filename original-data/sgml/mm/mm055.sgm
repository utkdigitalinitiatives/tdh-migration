			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This photograph is of the Fort Marr Blockhouse
				located at Benton in Polk County, Tennessee. Fort Marr, also known as 'The Old
				Fort,' was constructed around 1814 near Old Fort, Tennessee. The fort was
				positioned along the Old Federal Road and housed troops who were assigned to
				protect white travelers using the road and the Cherokees from Creek
				retaliation. The fort was also said to have been used to safeguard supplies and
				as a campsite for soldiers in transit during the Creek War of 1814-1815. The
				name Fort Marr was established when the fort was renovated into a stockade to
				use during the removal of the Cherokee people to the west. It is believed that
				the fort was named after George Washington Lent Marr, who served under Andrew
				Jackson during the War of 1812 and the campaign of 1813-1814. After being
				relocated times since its construction, it was moved to its present location at
				Benton in 1965. In 1980, Fort Marr became the property of the Conservation
				Department of the state of Tennessee to be maintained and used as a historic
				site.</NOTE>
