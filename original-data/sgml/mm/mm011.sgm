			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This drawing depicts the layout of Chota or
				Echota, an 18th century Overhill Cherokee village. It shows a central village
				plaza with both a circular winter council house and rectangular summer council
				house, which were used for public, social, and political events. Shown also are
				domestic dwellings with the same set-up, a circular winter house alongside a
				rectangular summerhouse. Also drawn are areas of dense refuse-filled pits.
				Archeological studies by the University of Tennessee from 1969 -1974 indicate
				that in the mid -1700's Chota had a population of around 300-500. There were
				approximately 60 domestic houses surrounding the village plaza that extended
				along the river for about a mile. Chota was recognized by Europeans as well as
				other Indians for its powerful social and economic influence and was regarded
				as the capital of the Cherokee nation. The excavations were conducted under
				contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority
				(TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Directors, J. Worth
				Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F. Schroedl</NOTE>
