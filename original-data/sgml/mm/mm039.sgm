			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of a mid-18th century
				Cherokee carved steatite (soapstone) pipe that was excavated at the site of
				Chota in 1969. Chota was recognized by Native Americans and European settlers
				as a powerful social and economic influence and was regarded as the capital of
				the Cherokee nation. Excavations of Chota and other Overhill villages were
				conducted by the University of Tennessee as part of the Tellico Archaeological
				Project in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River by
				the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with
				the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal
				investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J. Worth Greene.</NOTE>
