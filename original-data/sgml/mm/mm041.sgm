			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of the posthole pattern of
				a Cherokee winter townhouse at the former site of mid-18th century Toqua.
				Winter townhouses were cone-shaped and appeared to look like small mountains
				from a distance. Townhouses were used for all public, social, and political
				events. Some were large enough to hold 500 people. The seats were arranged like
				an amphitheater with the seats rising one above another, leaving an area in the
				center for a fire. Excavations were conducted by the University of Tennessee in
				1977 in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River by the
				Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the
				National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal
				investigator, Jefferson Chapman. Field Director, Robert D. Newman</NOTE>
