			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a drawing of a Cherokee segmented
				domestic structure from the mid-18th century based on archaeological
				excavations by the University of Tennessee at Overhill Cherokee sites on the
				lower Little Tennessee River Valley. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee villages
				were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of
				the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and
				laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations
				were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee
				River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and
				the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).</NOTE>
