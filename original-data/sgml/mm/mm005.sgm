			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of the central hearth of a
				Cherokee townhouse at Toqua, a mid-18th century Overhill Cherokee Village on
				the Little Tennessee River (present day Monroe County, Tennessee). The village,
				whose name means place of a mythic great fish, is on the same site as a late
				Mississippian Dallas culture, 1200-1600 A.D. American Revolutionary War forces
				destroyed the town in 1776 and 1780. It was destroyed again in 1788 post-war
				hostilities. In the 1970's, extensive archaeological excavations were conducted
				prior to its inundation by the waters of the Tellico Dam Reservoir. These
				excavations uncovered Mississippian structures as well as those of 18th century
				Cherokee. Of the latter were recorded 2 townhouses, 10 dwellings, and a number
				of refuse pits and burials. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee Villages were
				conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the
				Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and
				laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations
				were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). Principal Investigator, Jefferson Chapman. Field
				Director, Robert D. Newman.</NOTE>
