			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of the interior of Fort
				Loudoun, a British colonial military post on the lower Little Tennessee River
				that was occupied from 1756-1760. It was built in Overhill Cherokee territory
				in what is presently Monroe County and named for John Campbell, the Earl of
				Loudoun, who was commander-in-chief of British forces in the colonies. William
				G. De Brahm designed the fort, but abandoned the project because of
				disagreements he had with Capt. Demerre who commanded the militia troops and
				British regulars stationed at the post. Survival of this frontier outpost was
				dependent on good relations with the Cherokees who supplied food for trade
				goods. During the French and Indian War, tensions began to mount between the
				Cherokees and the colonists. In March 1760 the Cherokees laid siege to the
				fort, cutting off supplies and forcing its surrender. Excavations of Fort
				Loudoun were conducted by the University of Tennessee from 1975-1977 in
				anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico
				Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National
				Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator
				and Field Director, Carl Kutruff. </NOTE>
