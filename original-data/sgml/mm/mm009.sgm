			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a drawing of Overhill Cherokee winter
				and summer domestic structures. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee Villages were
				conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1982 as part of the
				Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and
				laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations
				were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee
				River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir and were
				conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). </NOTE>
