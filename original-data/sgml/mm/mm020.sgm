			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of posthole patterns of a
				winter townhouse dating back to the mid-18th century at the Overhill Cherokee
				village of Mialoquo. Overhill townhouses were situated in a common village
				plaza. There was generally a winter townhouse, which was a large circular dome
				in which a fire could be built in the center and an adjacent rectangular open
				pavilion for summer use. Both were used for public social and political
				activity. Excavations of Mialoquo were conducted by the University of Tennessee
				in 1977 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the
				flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and
				the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Jefferson
				Chapman. Field Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</NOTE>
