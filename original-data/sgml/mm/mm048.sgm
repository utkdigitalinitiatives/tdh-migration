			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a drawing of the Tellico Blockhouse.
				The Tellico Blockhouse was constructed in 1794-95 adjacent to the earlier Fort
				Loudoun at the confluence of the Tellico and Little Tennessee Rivers in what is
				presently Monroe County as a federal outpost. In 1805 federal officials and
				Overhill Cherokees negotiated a treaty at the Tellico Blockhouse which moved
				the federal agency south to the mouth of the Hiawassee. By 1807 the federal
				government abandoned Tellico and moved the rest of its agency to the Hiawassee
				River post, the new center of the Overhill Cherokee settlement. Excavations of
				the Tellico Blockhouse were conducted by the University of Tennessee from
				1972-1974 in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River
				by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. Excavations of the Blockhouse were conducted
				under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley
				Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director,
				Richard R. Polhemus.</NOTE>
