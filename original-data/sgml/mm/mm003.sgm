			 <NOTE TYPE="summary ">This is a photograph of mid-18th century
				Cherokee artifacts, animal bones, and plant food remains. It is from
				excavations of Overhill Cherokee Villages which were conducted by the
				University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico
				Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and laboratory
				studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations were
				conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River
				Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations
				were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee
				Valley Authority (TVA). </NOTE>
