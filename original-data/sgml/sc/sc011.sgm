			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written by Henry Knox,
				Secretary of War, to David Henley on August 31, 1793. In the letter, Knox
				appointed Henley as an agent for the War Department in the Southwest Territory.
				Knox further detailed the duties of Henley's new position, which mostly
				included regulating payments and supplies of all sorts for the troops of the
				Southwest Territory and also preventing and correcting improper expenditures.
				David Allison was appointed as a subordinate paymaster, who would be working
				under Henley. Henley's position was initially established on a temporary basis
				in response to recent occurrences in the Southwest Territory that required the
				deployment of more troops and greater expenditures by the War
				Department.</NOTE>
