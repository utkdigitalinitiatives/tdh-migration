			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter from A.J. Donalson to
				R.E.W. Earl dated May 6, 1821. In the letter, Donalson speaks of the
				hospitality of the citizens of New Orleans toward himself and his troops while
				they have been there. Donalson awaits information from Colonel Forbes on
				whether or not he has reached Pensacola, carrying orders to Cuba for the
				surrender of Florida to the United States. He states that after the information
				is attained, he will march to Pensacola as well and that troops will soon take
				possession of St. Augustine. Donalson states that people are moving from all
				parts of the country to Pensacola and that it has the potential to become a
				great commercial city. He concludes by asking R.E.W. Earl to finish the
				portrait of Donalson that he started and present it to his mother when it is
				completed.</NOTE>

		  <P> I avail myself of this, the first opportunity of conveying a letter

			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-29">29th</DATE> &mdash;
			 <UNCLEAR>ultimo</UNCLEAR> &mdash;; after a quiet and pleasant passage from
			 <ORIG REG="New Orleans">

			 <ADD PLACE="supralinear">only</ADD> accepting the little sickness, which
			 <HI>old ocean</HI> always tributes, as a passport through his dominions
			 &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>The 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl</ABBR> is in waiting for information from 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Forbes</NAME>,
			 who was appointed by the President, Agent and Commissary to carry the royal

			 <NAME TYPE="place">Cuba</NAME> for the surrender of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Florida's</NAME> : whether he has reached 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Pensacola</NAME>, or not, we are as yet
			 uninformed. 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Bronough</NAME> and 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Breckenridge</NAME> have been sent to Pensacola,
			 with a view of Reporting to the Governor of Pensacola, and ascertaining how far
			 things are in progress towards the ceremonies of exchange, we expect their
			 return <ORIG REG="today">to day</ORIG>. Our movements depend entirely upon
			 their report, or at least so much of it, as regards the <ORIG
			 REG="preparatory">perparatory</ORIG> state of the Spanish authority to carry
			 the treaty into effect &mdash; no delay will take place as the part of our
			 Government. The 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl</ABBR> is always prepared, and will be
			 prompt and quick. The <ORIG REG="Regiment">Regimant</ORIG> at 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Montpelier</NAME>, and the company of Artillery at

		  <P>We are extremely anxious to leave this place, notwithstanding the

			 served us with, dinners, suppers, <HI>sermons</HI> and all that such of
			 <ADD PLACE="supralinear">thing called</ADD> civility, which a sickly town a bad

		  <P>The people, I understand, are running from all parts of our country
			 to Pensacola, like Sandhill cranes from snow storms; I am afraid our western
			 boys will miss their aim, and will soon back again with hard times to their
			 brush heaps, for of all countries I have ever seen, I think this promises
			 least, to that <PB N="[3]"> plain sailing, forming character which attaches to
			 our Western countrymen generally. Pensacola if healthy, may attain some
			 eminence in a commercial point of view &mdash; The character which our nation
			 may give it, the safety of its Port, and the certainty of its market may induce
			 <ORIG REG="capitalism">capotalism</ORIG> to remove there; but this granted, and
			 all the fashionable report which is promised it, I think its greatness much
			 overrated, and this trumpeting <HI>mania</HI> of many of our people, will and
			 in <HI>feverish hard times.</HI> This is no business of ours, I shall therefore
			 say no more on the subject.</P>
