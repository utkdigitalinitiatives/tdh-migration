If I do go it will be <pb n="2"/> soon and by way of <name>St Louis</name>. I would have gone to <name>St. Louis</name> next week but I learned that the <name>Mississippi River</name> was Frozen up so that Boats could not go so high as St. Louis   The business that will take me to <abbr expan="St. Louis">St L</abbr>- is to deliver to the <abbr expan="United States Quarter">US Qr</abbr> Master US Army One hundred and Fifty tons of Commissary &amp; Ordinance Stores for which I made a contract <del type="overstrike">frth</del><add>with</add> the Qr Master at Cherokee agency in the name of <unclear>NB French &amp; Co</unclear> at the same time I made a contract <add>for them</add> with the Qr Master to transport the 4th Regiment of Us Infantry from the <name>Cherokee agency</name> to <name>Tuscumbia <abbr expan="Alabama">Ala</abbr></name>.

I will leave her and go to <name>Knoxville</name> in a few days to which place you in future will please direct your letters to me I received a letter from Rebecca Jane a few days since She says but little She speaks of Fathers death and of the good attention that was paid him during his illness She also says that his<name> Johnstown</name> business was all settled But that his <name>Pittsburgh</name> debts were not paid.
