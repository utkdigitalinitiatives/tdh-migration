			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is letter from Andrew Jackson (US
				president, 1829-1837) to Major William B. Lewis dated February 28, 1845. In the
				letter, Andrew Jackson states to Major Lewis his opinions about who he believes
				to be the best men for the Tennessee State Department administration. Jackson
				approves Mr. Clay for the Secretary of State position and Mr. Buchanan into the
				Department of State. He approves of Colonel Polk obtaining a position in the
				administration, but says that Mr. Tyler's succession to the administration
				would split the democracy apart and damage Polk's administration. Jackson
				concludes this letter by informing Major Lewis of his failing health. He
				consequently dies several months later.</NOTE>

			 <SALUTE>My dear Major,</SALUTE></OPENER> 
		  <P>Your interesting letter of the 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-17">17th</DATE>, instant is <ORIG
			 REG="received">recieved</ORIG>, advising that mine of the 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-04">4th</DATE> &amp; 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-05">5th</DATE> had reached you &mdash; Before
			 this reaches you 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Polks</NAME>
			 <ORIG REG="Cabinet">Cabinett</ORIG> will be known, and I am <GAP> there will no
			 one compose it unless under the terms I named to you should there be, then 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Polk must have changed his mind
			 after he left me. Your observations with regard to 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. <ORIG REG="Buchanan">Buchannan</ORIG></NAME>,
			 are correct &mdash; He <ORIG REG="showed">shwd</ORIG> a want of moral courage
			 in the affair of the intrigue of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Adams &amp; Clay</NAME> &mdash; did not do me
			 justice in the expose he then made &mdash; and I am sure about that time did
			 believe there was a perfect understanding between Adams &amp; Clay about the
			 presidency &amp; the <ORIG REG="Secretary">Secratary</ORIG> of State &mdash;
			 This I am sure of &mdash; But whether 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="I have">Ive</ABBR> ceded that there was any corruption
			 in the case or not I know not, but one thing I do know, that he wished me to
			 combat <ADD PLACE="supralinear">them</ADD> with <ORIG REG="their">thier</ORIG>
			 own weapons &mdash; that was to let my friends say if I was elected I would
			 make Mr. Clay Secretary of State &mdash; This to <EMPH>me</EMPH> appeared deep
			 corruption, &amp; I repelled at &mdash; with that honest indignation, as I
			 thought such corruption deserved!! Mr. Buchanan is a man of fine talents &amp;
			 if he comes into the Department of State will execute the duties with ability
			 &mdash;</P> <PB N="[2]"> 
		  <P>I was truly astonished at some information brought by 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Mr A. Jackson jr</NAME> &mdash; from 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Nashville</NAME> the other day. It was this, that 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Laughlin</NAME>
			 had went on to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Washington</NAME> had bought an interest in the
			 Madisonian, and expected to make it the organ of the administration This if
			 true would be one of the most fatal steps for 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Polk that could be taken it would be
			 placing him in the Shoes of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Tyler</NAME>, and Laughlin travelling on with
			 the 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> to Washington would place 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Polk under the implication of taking
			 him on there for the purpose which I am sure was not the case. Common sense
			 will at once shed the evil consequences that had ensue to 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Polk, to put himself in the attitude
			 of <ORIG REG="favoring">favouring</ORIG> Mr. Tyler for the succession &mdash;
			 It would split the democracy to pieces, and redound to the great injury of
			 Polks administration &mdash; I have from the moment I heard it put my face
			 against it, &amp; hope I have checked this inconsiderate movement &mdash; I
			 hope there is no truth in the rumor &mdash; if there is, there is less common
			 sense in the movers than I calculated upon, let me hear from you.</P> 
		  <P>your sister 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Mrs. Leister</NAME>, &amp; one of her daughters
			 spent day before yesterday with us &mdash; They all enjoy good health</P>
