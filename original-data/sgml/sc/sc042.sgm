				Brown</NAME>, Governor of Tennessee, 1845-1847, was the son of Rev. Aaron
			 Brown, of 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Virginia</NAME>. He was born August 15, 1795. He
			 graduated at 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</NAME>, 1814, and was
			 valedictorian of his class. His father moved to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME> this same year and Aaron V.
			 entered upon the study of law under 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Judge Trimble</NAME> at 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Nashville</NAME>. He later moved to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Giles County</NAME> and was a law partner of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">James K. Polk</NAME> until 1825. He was a member
			 of the State Senate 1821-1825, and of the Lower House 1831. He was a member of
			 Congress 1839-1845, retiring to become candidate for Governor. His opponent was
			 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Ephraim H. Foster</NAME>, a Whig, and the contest
			 was close. He was elected, however, but was defeated two years later by the
			 Whigs, and 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Neil S. Brown</NAME> became Governor. They were
			 not related. While Aaron V. Brown was Governor, the Mexican war was fought.
			 Tennessee's quoto of soldiers was 2,800; but when the Governor made the call
			 for volunteers 30,000 answered; only four regiments were accepted. The school
			 for the blind at Nashville and the one for deaf and dumb at 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Knoxville</NAME> were incorporated during Aaron
			 V. Brown's administration. The East Tennessee &amp; Virginia R. R. (now
			 Southern) was incorporated 1847. Governor Brown was Postmaster-General in 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Buchanan's</NAME> Cabinet. He died March 8,
			 1859.</P>
