			 <SALUTE>My dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER> 
		  <P> 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Polk </NAME>of 
			 <NAME>Tennessee</NAME> was nominated, <EMPH>a few minutes since, in 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Baltimore</NAME></EMPH> as the Democratic
			 Candidate for President of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>. &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>They are now calling the roll, by state, in the convention to see
			 whether or not they will all acquiesce unanimously in the nomination. &mdash;
			 So far as the states have been called they are unanimous and I suppose that no
			 state will withhold her <ORIG REG="ascent">assent</ORIG>. &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>This is the 3rd day since the convention met &mdash; until about one
			 hour since, the chances seemed to be divided between 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Van Buren</NAME> and 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Cass</NAME>. &mdash; Van Buren was withdrawn by
			 his friend &amp; attorney 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="General Benjamin">Genl Benjm</ABBR>
				F. Butler</NAME>, and Polk was soon after nominated. &mdash; I presume that
			 they will scarcely proceed, <ORIG REG="today">to day</ORIG>, to the Selection
			 of a candidate for vice President. &mdash; I will, at all events, close, &amp;
			 send this to the post officer. &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>The news is communicated by an electromagnetic telegraph, which runs
			 upon wires like electricity. The distance from Baltimore to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Washington</NAME> is 40 miles, and the news is
			 communicated along these wires instantaneously; it <ORIG
			 REG="reaches">reches</ORIG> Washington in less than <PB N="[2]"> one five
			 thousandth, (1/5,000), part of a second!!&mdash;</P> 
		  <P>Persons start from Baltimore, on the <ORIG REG="railroad">rail
			 road</ORIG>, and travel some 25 miles per hour; and when they reach Washington,
			 they find news from Baltimore 2 hours later than that which they bring with
			 them!!&mdash;</P> 
		  <P>The current news, you will learn much more satisfactorily from the
			 newspapers, than I can give it in this hasty epistle.&mdash;</P> 
		  <P> 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Totten</NAME> is
			 absent on a tour, for the purpose of inspecting the fortifications and other
			 military works on the sea board of our South Atlantic States &mdash; he has
			 been absent about a month, he is expected to return soon; but he will proceed
			 almost immediately to the north on a similar tour. &mdash; This leaves me with
			 my hands full of employment.&mdash;</P> 
		  <P>Give my love to Sister Margaret &amp; brother Albert &mdash;
			 Remember me kindly to all enquiring friends &mdash; Write to me soon.
			 &mdash;envelope the letter &amp; direct, on outside to "Engineer Department,
			 Washington D.C". &mdash; I write of necessity in great haste&mdash;</P>
