		  <P> 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Major Perrault</NAME> of the Topographical

			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Captain">Capt.</ABBR> Young</NAME>
			 but immediately to commence opening the contemplated military road from the
			 northern <ORIG REG="boundary">boundery</ORIG> of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Mississippi Territory</NAME> to the lake
			 <ORIG REG="Ponchetrain">Pon cher train</ORIG>, commencing at the first named

		  <NAME TYPE="place">Fort Hampton</NAME>, <ORIG REG="until">untill</ORIG>
		  the affair of the upper Mississippi will justify the removal of the two
		  companies of the 8th Infantry now there. &mdash; Orders have been given to 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">General Ripley</NAME> to furnish two companies to
		  commence cutting at the southern extremity of the road under the directions of 
		  <ABBR EXPAN="Captain">Capt.</ABBR> Young,

		  instructed to open its thirty feet wide, causway all marshes &amp; swamps 20
		  feet wide, raising them above high water mark, and to make bridges of durable
		  materials over all streams that their means will permit. </P> 
		  <P>It is much to be regretted that the 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Topographical">Topo</ABBR> Engineers have not been
			 furnished with the necessary mathematical instruments, as none can be procured
			 here, and <PB N="[2]"> Major Perrault's <ADD PLACE="superlinear">total</ADD>

			 <NAME TYPE="place"><ORIG
				REG="Philadelphia">Philidelphia</ORIG></NAME>, as it is improbable that he can
			 procure either a quadrant or Sextant to take the latitude, necessary on
			 commencing the road at the north point of beginning. But as it appears to be

			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl.</ABBR> Coffee</NAME>
			 having commenced the duty enjoined upon him; I shall <ORIG
