Rhea</name> have taken the measures you both advise me of as to the subject of my land in <name>Overton</name> and the <orig reg="affair">affour</orig> of Hill- they are laying very <orig reg="scheme">scheime</orig> in their power to get that property out of my hands by some <orig reg="relinquish">ronquish</orig> scheime or others, I must contrive some new schieme if I   live to see you again, in order to have all the suits on that property carried up to the Federal Court, and not longer be pestered in the State Courts.  The <name>chesapeake</name> is full of <name>British</name> <orig reg="shipping">shiping</orig> and troops; they have landed a large body of troops near <name>norfolk</name>, but have <add>been</add> roughly handled in so doing; four or five Boats were sunk and as many taken, a number killed, wounded and taken prisoners.  It is said that nearly two whole companies departed them and come over I expect the times are very warm about <name>Norfolk</name>- Our coasts are lined with the enemies fleets, and no doubt they will make grand <orig reg="exertions">excertions</orig> in every quarter- Our troops have been very success full in <name>Canada</name>.  We have taken nearly every garrison and place of importance in the <orig reg="upper">uper</orig> <name>Canada</name>, but not without some loss, but such must be expected.  I have written you on the 4th &amp; 7th instant, and forward you the newspapers by way mail- we are on the tax business which seem to go on very  slowly and will take us much time- I have become quite sick being so much from home, and war I there again I should <pb n="[2]"/> again I should be very unwilling to leave it.  I am so confined on the military committee, that I can scarcely find gesture but  to write- there is only seven of us, and almost every thing relative to that all important subject, is laid before that committee, and to make arrangements for the <orig reg="defense">defence</orig> of all our extensive frontiers on both sides, is an immense undertaking indeed-We have heard nothing lately from the north- <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr>. <name>Dearborne</name> have become very sickly and have resigned- <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> <name>Smith</name> I am informed have arrived in <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr>, town, this evening- I shall go to see him on Morning. I shall endeavor to have you with your Regiment sent Northwardly. as you seem to wish-  It is very uncertain as to our siting, but think at any rate it will not last longer then the next month; and so soon as I can ride home afterwards, I shall do it. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> <name>sparks</name> letter of the 15th instant have come to hand on yesterday, and am glad to hear he is so much better- I fear the warm springs will not be good for him, to which place I understand he intends going- make my affectionate respects to your mother, (<orig reg="though">tho</orig> I hear nothing from her for a long time) and all the rest of our friends- The President is much indisposed for about two weeks past and in my opinion he is in danger, tho the Doctors say he is better, but I have my fears- General <name>Hampton</name> have gone to the north, and Wilkinson is expected here every day on his way to the same place- I am now writing late in the night- adieu- </p> <closer>Yours affectionately- <signed>John Sevier</signed> <add>P.S.
