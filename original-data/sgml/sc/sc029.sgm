			 <SALUTE>Dear brothers and friends</SALUTE></OPENER> 
		  <P>After spending a few days with my family, I left home on the 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-20">20th</DATE> <UNCLEAR>ult</UNCLEAR> for 
			 <NAME TYPE="place"> Mossy Creek</NAME>, which place I
			 <ORIG REG="reached">reachd</ORIG> on Saturday time enough to preach at 12
			 O'clock &mdash; there being a sacramental <UNCLEAR>meeting</UNCLEAR>
			 <ADD PLACE="supralinear">there.</ADD> <DEL TYPE="overstrike">at that
		  place.</DEL> It is in a good <ORIG REG="neighborhood">neighbourhood</ORIG>,
		  bounded on the South, by 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Bays Mountain</NAME> and on the North by poor
		  ridges.</P> 
		  <P>On the Sabbath I addressed the people on the great subject of my
			 agency &mdash; After I had closed, <UNCLEAR>Dr</UNCLEAR> 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Reverend">Rev</ABBR> added some well timed remarks. We
			 obtained a pledge of $ 17. &mdash; collected some <ORIG
			 REG="friends">frinds</ORIG>, and <ORIG REG="organized">organised</ORIG> the
			 Mossy Creek Bible Society. The <ORIG REG="friends">frinds</ORIG> collected were
			 left with the <UNCLEAR>Treasurer</UNCLEAR> until he could obtain more. I think
			 the Society will gradually increase and do much good. From that neighbourhood I
			 went to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Beans Station</NAME>, <UNCLEAR>via</UNCLEAR>
			 Rutledge, &amp; where I spent two days, preached on Saturday and Sabbath
			 &mdash; I formed a small Bible Society containing <DEL
		  TYPE="overstrike">some</DEL> about fifty members, some fifteen of whom are
		  <ORIG REG="colored">coloured</ORIG> people, who take a <EMPH>deep</EMPH>
		  interest in the cause, paying $3.00 of what was collected. This Society is
		  surrounded by a vast range of <ADD PLACE="supralinear">partial</ADD>
		  <ORIG REG="distribution">distibution</ORIG> <UNCLEAR>O</UNCLEAR> , May it be as
		  a Light in a dark place"!</P> 
		  <P> 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-03-30">March 30.th</DATE> I went across the country
			 some twenty miles <ADD PLACE="supralinear">near</ADD> to the Mouth of Chucky
			 &mdash; at <UNCLEAR>Beth Carr M. ?. &mdash;</UNCLEAR> There being held a
			 protracted meeting there, at which I remained until Wednesday. I
			 <ADD PLACE="supralinear">there </ADD>formed the Beth Carr Bible Society,
			 <UNCLEAR>?</UNCLEAR> &mdash; collected for it $8.23. and obtained
			 <ORIG REG="additional">aditional</ORIG> pledges, most of which will be, if they
			 have not already been paid.</P> 
		  <P>This Society is designed to supply with Bibles &amp;
			 <ORIG REG="Testaments">Testerments</ORIG> a poor destitute section which lies
			 between the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Chucky and French Broad rivers</NAME>, north of
			 the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Paint Mountain</NAME>. They have a <HI>great
			 work</HI> to perform; with <HI>small means.</HI> I have situated places for
			 these Small Societies where they could do much, as distributors "of other man's
			 bounties" I think it is better to have small societies than Bible
			 <ORIG REG="Committees">Committies</ORIG>. My views on this subject have been
			 previously given with <UNCLEAR>??riess.</UNCLEAR></P> 
		  <P>Wednesday evening, 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-04-01">April 1st</DATE> I crossed the Chucky &amp;
			 French Broad to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Newport</NAME>. The Society <PB N="[2]">
			 <ADD PLACE="top left corner">2,</ADD> There had been <UNCLEAR>urged</UNCLEAR>
			 until it had collected and sent on some $40. for books, which are daily
			 expected.</P> 
		  <P>From Newport I passed up the French Broad, <HI>via</HI> Warm Springs
			 , 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="et cetera">&amp;c</ABBR> to <ORIG REG="Asheville"> 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Ashville</NAME></ORIG> N.C. where I spent the
			 Sabbath and two following days. In 
			 <DATE VALUE="1844-10-00">Oct 1844</DATE>. The Holston Conference held
			 its session within seven miles of <ORIG REG="Asheville">Ashville</ORIG>. 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Bishop Jones</NAME> was there &mdash; and a fresh
			 impulse was given to the Bible Cause. 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Rev-ern Langdon</NAME>; Agent of the A &amp; N.e.
			 Bible Society was in attendance, and obtained some cash, and pledges from
			 <UNCLEAR>sundry</UNCLEAR> persons <HI>to take in</HI> all, about 800 Bibles.
			 Its been some 8 months before these Bibles came in, <HI>three fourths</HI> of
			 the subscribers <DEL TYPE="overstrike">negle</DEL> refused or neglected &mdash;
		  as they <HI>have still done</HI> &mdash; to take them. Learning the state of
		  things there &mdash; and believing the cause was suffering, I went up &mdash;
		  delivered an address on the subject &mdash; formed or ? &mdash;
		  <ORIG REG="organized">organised</ORIG> a Bible Society &mdash; collected $42.00
		  and made arrangements to have the Bibles distributed &mdash; myself taking away
		  <HI>one hundred <DEL TYPE="overstrike">Bibles</DEL></HI> of them. It is of
		  great importance to an agent to be personally <ORIG
		  REG="acquainted">accquainted</ORIG> with the leading
		  <UNCLEAR>citizens</UNCLEAR> of a country. By this means I <ORIG
		  REG="succeeded">seceeded</ORIG> in obtaining such assistance as I trust, will
		  ere long supply that mountain country with the word of God.</P> 
		  <P>Wednesday, 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-04-08">April 8th</DATE> I passed 20 miles down the
			 French Broad &mdash; on the 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-09">9th</DATE>, I crossed the Paint Mountain
			 into 
			 <NAME TYPE="place"><ORIG REG="Greene">Green</ORIG> 
				<ABBR EXPAN="County">Co</ABBR></NAME> 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Tennessee">Tn</ABBR> I sent 30 Bibles to the Beth Carr 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Bible">B.</ABBR> Society and left with a pious lady
			 &mdash; 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Mrs Nelson</NAME> &mdash; near the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Warm Springs</NAME>, 20 <DEL
		  TYPE="overstrike">Bibles</DEL> for distribution among the destitute in the
		  mountains, South of the Warm Springs. The 
		  <NAME TYPE="persons">Methodists</NAME> and 
		  <NAME TYPE="persons">Baptists</NAME> have small Societies out there. I
		  also left ten Bibles with a pious lady, 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">Miss Eliza Jane Coutter</NAME>, fifteen miles South
		  of <ORIG REG="Greeneville">Greenville</ORIG>, near Paint Mountain. I have heard
		  of <DEL TYPE="overstrike">many</DEL> some affecting cases of destitution, but
		  deem it unnecessary to relate them, unless they were uncommonly
		  <UNCLEAR>touching</UNCLEAR>. I then passed through <ORIG
		  REG="Greeneville">Greenville</ORIG> &mdash; in which place I am
		  <ADD PLACE="supralinear">hereafter</ADD> to make a <HI>special</HI> effort,
		  <HI>via</HI> 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Rhea </NAME><UNCLEAR>Towers</UNCLEAR>, to
		  <ORIG REG="Jonesboro"> 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Jones boro</NAME></ORIG>, to meet a Sabbath
		  appointment of 3 weeks standing. It was a rainy time on Sabbath, we collected a
		  <HI>respectable</HI> congregations however, at 12 O'clock, in the Presbyterian
		  Church, and <ORIG REG="reorganized">organised</ORIG> or <ORIG
		  REG="reorganized"><HI>re</HI> organised</ORIG> a Bible Society which I presume
		  has been officially reported. The cash pledged and paid down was some $50.00
		  &mdash; which will be doubled soon, I hope, as the <PB N="[3]">
		  <ADD PLACE="top right corner">3</ADD> friends from the country, who will
		  hereafter unite in the common cause, were kept away by the rain. The funds
		  collected were left with the Treasurer, as he expects soon to be in 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">New York</NAME>. At early candle lighting we met in
		  the Methodist Church and organised the 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Washington 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="County">Co</ABBR></NAME> Juvenile Bible Society,
		  Auxiliary 
		  <ABBR EXPAN="et cetera">&amp;c</ABBR> &mdash; collecting $20. This
		  Society intends to supply <HI>the</HI> County Sunday Schools with Testaments. I
		  believe it <HI>will</HI> do well.</P> 
		  <P>Monday 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-13">13th</DATE> I <HI>drove</HI> to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Blountville, Sullivan 
				<ABBR EXPAN="County">Co</ABBR></NAME> and <HI>finished</HI> the
			 organization of a Society previously <UNCLEAR>convened</UNCLEAR> there. I 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="collected">collecd</ABBR> of the Treasurer $38.86
			 &frac14; over what had been paid for carriage on the 3 boxes. The people in
			 that place are waking up to the subject, and before the close of the year, they
			 will probably dispose of nearly a thousand Bibles, and more than that number of
			 Testaments &mdash; increasing your funds some $500.00 &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>From Blountville I went to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Scott County 
				<ABBR EXPAN="Virginia">Va.</ABBR></NAME> taking with me an
			 <ORIG REG="additional">aditional</ORIG> supply of one hundred and thirteen
			 Bibles and Testaments. I made arrangements to have most of these sold in 
			 <NAME TYPE="place"> Scott</NAME> and <ORIG REG="Lee"> 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Lea</NAME></ORIG> Counties, by <UNCLEAR>several
			 responsible</UNCLEAR> individuals, who will <HI>cheerfully</HI> serve
			 <HI>the</HI> good cause without charge</P> 
		  <P>From these parts I returned and passed through 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Kingsport</NAME>, and was glad to find that the
			 Society there had received their books and were doing well. I came on through 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Rogersville</NAME>, <HI>also</HI>, where I shall
			 make a spiral effort, in due time. I had an appointment at this place on Friday
			 evening, which I attended to, The Society which I found here 3 weeks ago is
			 doing well, for a <HI>small place</HI></P> 
		  <P>I have <HI>now</HI> closed my monthly <UNCLEAR>report</UNCLEAR> The
			 prospects are brightening. I am satisfied I have never been engaged in so great
			 a work &mdash; O may I be enabled to advance <ADD PLACE="supralinear">it</ADD>
			 more effectually!</P>
