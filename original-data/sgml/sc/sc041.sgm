			 <NAME TYPE="person">James Chamberlain Jones</NAME>, Governor of
			 Tennessee, 1841-1845, was the first native born Governor of 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME>. He was born June 7, 1809, near 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Nashville</NAME>; was educated for the law, but
			 became a farmer on account of his health. Without political ambition, Jones was
			 induced to run for the Legislature 1839, and was elected to the Lower House. He
			 developed such strength as a campaign speaker that he was chosen as elector on
			 Whig ticket 1840. This brought him into prominence and 1841 he was the
			 unanimous choice of the Whigs for Governor. His campaign against 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Polk</NAME>, the Democratic candidate, has become
			 memorable as the origin of modern political "stump" speaking. With wit and
			 humorous stories he completely swept aside the logical arguments of his
			 opponent, and gave the people a campaign of good humor. He was elected by a
			 vote of 53,586 to 50,343. 1843 he defeated Polk the second time. Among the
			 important acts of his administration was the selection of Nashville as the
			 permanent capital of the State, 1843, and the beginning of the erection of the
			 present Capitol. 1848 Jones headed the electorial ticket of the State for 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Taylor</NAME> and 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Filmore</NAME> and 1851 was elected to U.S.
			 Senate where he served until 1857. He died at 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Memphis</NAME> October 29, 1859.</P>
