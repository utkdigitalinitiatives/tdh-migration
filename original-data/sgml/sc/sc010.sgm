			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written to Colonel
				Allison from John Cocke on September 6, 1813. The letter describes a possible
				meditated attack by the Creek Indians on the people living on the frontier.
				John Cocke orders Colonel Allison to put the first brigade of the militia on
				alert to defend the frontier if attacked by the Creeks. Cocke insists on being
				notified of any attacks or actions taken by the Colonel's brigade and offers
				expenditures for supplies needed in this defensive action. John Cocke concludes
				by warning Colonel Allison to not mistreat any friendly Indians, but to treat
				them with friendship and hospitality.</NOTE>
