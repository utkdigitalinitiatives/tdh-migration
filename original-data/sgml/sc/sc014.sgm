		  <P>Whereas it is represented to the present General Assembly, that

			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME> and this state, do not consider
			 themselves under either the jurisdiction of that or this state, and therefore
			 refuse the payment of any taxes to either of the said States, or to the
			 collectors of either for the General Government, because the state of 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">North Carolina</NAME>, on the 
			 <DATE VALUE="1790-02-25"><ORIG REG="twenty-fifth">twenty fifth</ORIG>
				day of February 1790</DATE>, ceded the said State of Tennessee, then called the
			 
			 <NAME> Southwestern Territory</NAME>, to the Government of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>; and therefore the act
			 entitled "an act concerning the southern boundary of this state," passed on the
			 
			 <DATE VALUE="1791-12-07">seventh of December 1791</DATE> , in this
			 legislature to establish the line commonly called Walker's line, as the
			 boundary between

			 General Government hath erected the said Southwestern Territory into an
			 <ORIG REG="independent">independant</ORIG> state, by their act of 
			 <DATE VALUE="1796-06-01">June the first 1796</DATE>, whereby it has
