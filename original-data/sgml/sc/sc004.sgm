				percentage would be retained by the college. The funds gained through the
				lottery for the College will benefit the Seminary of Education. The document
				concludes by giving incentives to the public as to why they should participate
				in the lottery, such as the fact that it will benefit and education the
				students of the present, as well as the future.</NOTE>

		  <P>Prizes payable thirty days after the completion of the drawing,
			 subject to a deduction of fifteen <ORIG REG="percent">per cent</ORIG>. And
			 those prizes not demanded within twelve months, shall be considered as
			 relinquished for the benefit of the College.</P> 
		  <P>The Lottery, of which the above is the Scheme, has the sanction of
			 an Act of the last Legislature. That act, requires the subscribers to give
			 bond, that the Prizes shall be paid, or the money refunded, if the Lottery
			 should not be drawn: This requisition has been complied with. We flatter
			 ourselves, that the Scheme will be satisfactory to all who wish to become
			 adventurers, with a view to better their circumstances. Little more than two
			 blanks to a prize. No prize that will not yield some profit to the fortunate
			 drawer. The prizes to be paid, not in this, or in that species of property, but
			 in CASH, which will command property of every description. No doubts are
			 entertained but a sufficient number of Tickets will be sold to enable the
			 drawing to be commenced in a short time.</P> 
		  <P>When the object to be attained by this Lottery is considered, it is
			 believed, every individual will be anxious to become an adventurer. It is not
			 designed to retrieve a shattered fortune, nor to convert into cash, at an
			 extravagant price, property which is of no use ; but it is intended to aid the
			 funds of a Seminary of Education, where youth of the present and succeeding
			 generations, may have their minds prepared, in such a manner, as to make them
			 ornaments to their families, and useful to their country &mdash; as will enable
			 them to understand their rights as citizens, and their duties as servants of
			 the people.</P> 
		  <P>If we are attached to the government under which we live &mdash; If
			 we wish to have it transmitted to our posterity, let us unite in the support of
			 Seminaries of learning; without them, our children must be ignorant; while
			 ignorant, they will be ever liable to be misled by the designing, and finally,
			 to be governed by some <ORIG REG="enterprising">enterprizing</ORIG> despot.
			 With Seminaries of Education, well endowed, those of every rank and description
			 will become informed; they will understand their government, the powers and
			 rights which it confers and secures;&mdash; when these are understood, they
			 will never be yielded but with their lives. We therefore respectfully solicit,
			 and hope to receive the public patronage.</P>
