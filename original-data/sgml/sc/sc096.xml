He says the committee is nothing better than a <name>spanish</name> <orig reg="Inquisition">Inquision</orig>, and expresses his astonishment that the House should ever <add>have</add> raised any such body.  In this letter to Wise, he takes occasion to abuse the committee, &amp; Congress for appointing it and Wise personally, both for his conduct on the committee and for his speeches in the House.  But as this whole business will ultimately come before the public eye, I will for the present, desist from giving you any farther account of the matter, as the space of a letter would not be, at all, equal, to a full development of all the <orig reg="villainy">villany</orig> that is now, here carrying on-</p><p>It is not known, except by a few who is to compare the New Cabinet- In fact there is less said about it than you would suppose-</p><p>I will buy and procure you some beat seed- there is none in this place- Present my respects to <abbr expan="Misses">Mrs</abbr>.
