			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written by Henry
				Sherburne, agent for the Chickasaw Nation, to an unknown recipient on August 7,
				1819. In the letter, Sherburne explains that the Chickasaw Nation had
				objections to the boundary line of their land that the recipient of the letter
				had laid out. The letter also states that the line has been drawn without
				regard to specifications listed in the treaty between the Chickasaw and the
				United States government. Sherburne states that the Chickasaw want nothing but
				a new line drawn that respects the conditions noted in the treaty.</NOTE>
