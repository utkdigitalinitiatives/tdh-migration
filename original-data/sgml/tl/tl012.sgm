			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document, entitled "Thrilling Narrative.
				How The Judgement of Heaven fell on the Indians who wounded Rev'd Joseph Brown
				in 1794," was written to Colonel A. W. Putman on March 30, 1858 by Reverend
				Joseph Brown. In this narrative Brown details the events surrounding his return
				trip from Knoxville to Nashville. It appears that he was informed by a Cherokee
				trader that there was a large body of Indians waiting to do harm on the direct
				route, so he was advised to return through Kentucky. Accepting this advice,
				Brown and travel partners, William Hayes, a Negro woman, Ross, Friley, and
				others set out only to be ambushed along the way by Indians. During the attack
				Brown was wounded in the shoulder although they escaped. He stayed with a Dutch
				man for two nights and then with a brother-in-law, who was a doctor, of Ross's
				for six weeks, until he healed well enough to travel home. Later, Brown was
				informed by another trader that the same party of Indians had rode into East
				Tennessee to take prisoners of women and children and if Brown and others
				wanted to free the prisoners he would show them where they were. Brown set out
				with a group of white men to seek revenge on the Indians. When they located
				them they noticed that the Indians were wearing white men's clothing and,
				satisfied that these were the guilty Indians, they decided to lay in wait to
				ambush them in the morning fearing that the prisoners would be killed if they
				acted too quickly. The Indians were all killed the next day and the white men
				found a little girl who had hid for three days. Brown submitted this account
				with the intent that it would be published or returned. It was, in fact,
				published in the "Banner of Peace" August 5, 1858.</NOTE>
