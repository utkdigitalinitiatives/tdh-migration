			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written to a General
				Smith from William Blount, then governor of the state of Tennessee (1790-1795),
				in Knoxville on April 3, 1794. In his letter, Governor Blount reported that
				French Minister Edmund Genet had been removed from his post, thus bringing to
				halt the project of General Clark. Also, Governor Blount referred to his
				correspondence with a person he referred to by the initials D.A., who had
				informed Governor Blount that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs was in favor
				of commencing offensive military operations. Governor Blount also discussed his
				upcoming business plans and some news from the House of Representatives.
