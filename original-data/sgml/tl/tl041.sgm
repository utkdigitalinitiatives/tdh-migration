			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written to James
				McHenry, Secretary of War, from Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on
				April 24, 1797. The letter is mainly in reference to the arrival of two men by
				the names of Hawkins and Pickens in Tennessee in order to determine the Indian
				boundary line. Sevier explained that the drawing of the line had caused much
				uneasiness among Tennessee settlers who feared that their residences might fall
				within Indian boundaries. Sevier suggested that the drawing of the line be
				postponed in the case of conflict with the European powers, for he also warned
				the the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws were all in friendly
				alliances with the Spanish government. Sevier feared that drawing the line
				would only spark tensions between these tribes and the American
				citizens.</NOTE>
