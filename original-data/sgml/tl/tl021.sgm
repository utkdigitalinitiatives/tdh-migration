			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter from William Blount,
				Governor of the state of Tennessee from 1790 to 1795, to General Smith, dated
				June 17, 1793. In his letter, Blount stated that he had been informed that the
				President and Secretary of War were awaiting his arrival in order to discuss
				business regarding the Indians in the South. Blount and others were apparently
				unhappy with the Indians, and Blount suggested that a full-scale war was the
				only way to coerce them into acting in accordance with the US's wishes. Blount
				also discussed providing arms for the frontier settlers.</NOTE>
