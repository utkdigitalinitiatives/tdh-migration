				states that the treaty with the Cherokees has failed and that some of the state
				commissioners would not be returning for the next treaty meeting. Sevier asks
				Steele to appoint one or two commissioners from the state to take their place,
				specifically asking for General James Robertson to be one of the
				commissioners.</NOTE>
