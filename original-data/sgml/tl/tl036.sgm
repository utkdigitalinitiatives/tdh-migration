			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter, dated March 5, 1797,
				written by Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) and addressed to John
				Watts and other chiefs of the Cherokee Nation. The letter was written in
				response to a letter by the Cherokee chiefs regarding earlier communications
				sent by Sevier. In this letter, Sevier negated the claims of Watts and others
				that the Cherokees have not caused damage to the persons or properties of white
				settlers. Sevier cited instances in which white settlers were killed in
				retaliation for the murders of Chief Red Bird and his attendant. Sevier also
				criticized the Cherokee Nation for not making an official complaint regarding
				those murders. Furthermore, he denied Watts' claim that his preceding
				communications were threatening in nature, as he stated that he was merely
				hoping to convince the Cherokees of the dangers of going to war. Sevier
				contended that he wished to establish and promote a peace between the United
				States and the Cherokee Nation.</NOTE>
