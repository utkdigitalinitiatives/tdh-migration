			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written by John
				Sevier, Governor of Tennessee from 1796-1801 and 1803-1809, to Colonel Joseph
				McMinn, Colonel Samuel Wear, and Major John Cowan, dated August 9, 1804. In the
				letter, Sevier informed these men that he had received word of a meeting to be
				held with the commissioners of Georgia regarding a road that would be built
				connecting the two states, which would also run through Cherokee lands. Sevier
				commanded the men to attend the meeting, and he gave further instructions of
				the agreements to be made with the Georgian commissioners. Sevier wanted to
				make certain that both states would have an equal amount of work to do in
				constructing the road and reap an equal number of advantages from its
				existence. </NOTE>

		  <P>Having received notice from the Georgian Commissioners proposing a
			 meeting at 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">James Vans</NAME> on the 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-15">15th</DATE> Instant, you will readily
			 discover the necessity of repairing to that place with the utmost dispatch</P> 
		  <P>Permit me to recommend in the first place an agreement to be made
			 with the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Georgian</NAME> Commissioners Consigning to each
			 State an equal part of the road most <ORIG REG="convenient">conveinant</ORIG>
			 for each party to open and clear out &mdash; If this point should be settled
			 and agreed upon, very probably your place of meeting will be considered near
			 the Middle Ground &mdash; Secondly &mdash; you will proceed to explore and Mark
			 out the nearest, best, and most <ORIG REG="convenient">conveinant</ORIG>
			 <ORIG REG="routes">routs</ORIG>, for <ORIG REG="wagon">waggon</ORIG> roads,
			 leading from the two stations agreed upon between the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME> and Cherokees, (<ORIG
			 REG="to wit">towit</ORIG>) "From Southwest point and 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tellico Blockhouse</NAME>," to such part of the
			 way and place as may be agreed upon by the Commissioners:
			 <ADD PLACE="bottom, right">The</ADD> <PB N="[2]"> The two roads leading from
			 the aforesaid points, to intersect each other conformably to the articles of
			 agreement between the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place"><ORIG REG="United">united</ORIG> States</NAME> and
			 the Indians. You will also agree and conclude upon a certain and Suitable place
			 to prefix a twin pike to be erected. As the two roads to be laid off from 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tellico</NAME> and Southwest point will require
			 some time, I therefore recommend the road leading from 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tellico</NAME>, to be the first marked out,
			 provided you <ORIG REG="cannot">can not</ORIG> have them both laid off at or
			 near the same time &mdash; </P> 
		  <P>I have observed that probably your place of meeting would be about
			 the Middle Ground, but you will please to Notice, that for a great part of the
			 Way leading from 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee <ORIG REG="River">river</ORIG></NAME>
			 there <DEL TYPE="overstrike">is</DEL> <ADD PLACE="supralinear">are</ADD> two

		  than 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME>, who <DEL

		  Sister States, taking into <ORIG REG="Vein">Viene</ORIG> mutual and beneficial
		  advantages &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>For your further Guide and instructions, you will attend strictly to
			 the Articles of agreement between the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME> and the Cherokees, and the
			 law passed by our <DEL TYPE="overstrike"><UNCLEAR>unk</UNCLEAR></DEL>
		  legislature on the Subject <ADD PLACE="supralinear">at their late Session</ADD>

		  <NAME TYPE="person"><ORIG REG="Georgian">Georgin</ORIG></NAME>
		  Commissioners what particular part of the road on our side, we are to cut and

		  &mdash; <ADD PLACE="supralinear">copies of each you will herewith receive</ADD>
		  I have no doubt you will perceive the propriety of making every exertion to

		  <ORIG REG="immediately">immeadiately</ORIG> thereon, the manner in which the
