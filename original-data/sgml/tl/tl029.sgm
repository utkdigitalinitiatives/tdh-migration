			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written by Tennessee
				Governor John Sevier (1796-1801) to the members of Congress, dated January 17,
				1797. Sevier reported that it was believed that Cherokees had been plundering
				the wagons of frontier settlers along the Cumberland road and taking their
				horses, and he stated that the Cherokee agent had complained about the size of
				the territory awarded to frontier settlers. Also reported, was that at least
				one Indian had been killed, but Sevier had doubts about this because the
				subject had not been brought before him by the Cherokees or their agent. After
				he made complaints about inefficiencies within the postal system, Sevier
				explained that Captains Wades and Sparks had arrived in the frontier but that
				their companies were insufficient. Sevier requested that three companies of
				infantry and a troop of horses be sent to help protect the frontier. </NOTE>
