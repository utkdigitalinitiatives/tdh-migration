			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document, entitled "Opposition of
				McGillivray the Great Chief of the Creeks" is comprised of two parts. The first
				is a letter written by Colonel James Robertson to Creek chief Alexander
				McGillivray on August 3, 1788. In that letter, Robertson discussed episodes of
				violence between the Creeks and/or Cherokees and American settlers and troops.
				Robertson also offered McGillivray a gun and some land in the Cumberland
				region. The second part of the document is a detailed explanation of
				Robertson's letter written by A.W. Putnam in 1859. Putnam provided an analysis
				of the historical context of the letter as well as his own opinions of the
				situations at hand at the time the letter was written. Putnam described the
				hostilities that existed between the Creeks and the American frontier settlers.
				He painted a portrait of the Creeks and the other tribes of the region as
				"treacherous and wily and cruel savages" who were working with foreign
				governments, particularly the Spanish, to undermine American aims. Putnam
				analyzed the connotation of Robertson's words to McGillivray, by stating that
				it was both threatening and complementing at the same time. Putnam also related
				details of the state of the American government at the time, particularly the
				shift from the initial loose confederacy of states to the current federalist
				form of government. He discussed how the initial instability, particularly in
				the South, of the newly formed United States, desires to settle West, and
				ongoing conflicts with the Spanish complicated relations with the Native
				American tribes, specifically the Creeks. Putnam also reported his analysis of
				McGillivray's character. McGillivray is presented as a cunning, influential man
				who was after his own interests and who was working with the Spanish to thwart
				American settlement. To Putnam, Robertson's letter presented McGillivray with a
				compromise--that his financial and political success would be guaranteed as
				long as he used his influence to encourage American aims in the frontier. As
				Putnam noted, two years after Robertson's 1788 letter, a treaty was concluded
				which established secure Indian land boundaries, ceded a large territory of
				land to the US, and gave McGillivray the rank of Brigadier General and a salary
				from the government. Thus, the US government was able to allay the Creek
				Nation. </NOTE>

		  <P><ADD PLACE="top, right">2</ADD> The foregoing letter contains matter
			 of much variety and deep historical interest. It is bound in the first volume
			 of the letters and correspondence of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl</ABBR> James
				Robertson</NAME> : It is in the handwriting of that master-Clerk and amanuensis
			 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Andrew Ewing</NAME> , &mdash; 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl</ABBR>

		  <P>The design to offer some remarks upon its various paragraphs and
			 facts:</P> 
		  <P>And first, we notice that it is in reply to communications; 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="received">recd</ABBR> by the hands of two prominent
			 citizens of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Cumberland District</NAME>, 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Misters">Messrs</ABBR> 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Hoggatt</NAME> and 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Ewing</NAME>.</P> 
		  <P>These gentlemen had gone on an important mission to the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Creek nation</NAME> early in the spring of this
			 year, and bore with them a joint letter from 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Bledsoe</NAME>
			 &amp; 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR> Robertson</NAME>
			 to 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl</ABBR>
				McGillivray</NAME>, the distinguished 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creek</NAME> Chief.</P> 
		  <P>The reasons and objects of this step were various. The Indians had
			 recently killed or taken away captive a number of persons from these
			 settlements, and among others had cruelly murdered 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Peyton</NAME> , the son of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR>
				Robertson</NAME>. In his letter to 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">McGillivray</NAME> in regards to this affliction,
			 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col.</ABBR> <PB N="[4]">
				Robertson</NAME> gave vent to the grief of a bereaved father, &mdash; but
			 wisely refrained from threats of vengeance </P> 
		  <P>The spirit which would have sought revenge for such personal wrong,
			 was held in check by a high sense of duty and patriotic regard for the
			 well-being and safety of the community in which he occupied so prominent a
			 place.</P> 
		  <P>But it was important to learn the particular causes for these
			 outrages committed in violation of professions of peace &amp; friendship And
			 when it was discovered that these murders and depredations were committed by
			 the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME> who lived at a great distance &amp;
			 on the other side of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee river</NAME> &mdash; a nation claiming
			 none of the land on this side of that river, and with whose territories the
			 people of 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Cumberland</NAME> did not intermeddle, strong
			 suspicions arose in the minds of the whites that there must be
			 <ADD PLACE="infralinear">some</ADD> deep and dangerous murder plot, &mdash;
			 some evil and foreign influence at work, to bring this mischief upon innocent
			 heads. </P> 
		  <P>The leading men here were not wholly ignorant of the intrigues and
			 policy of nations who had laid claim to this rich valley region, and were
			 jealous of each <PB N="[5]"> other and alike <ADD
			 PLACE="supralinear">jealous</ADD> of the powers and consequences of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">American</NAME> government upon the rivers
			 leading into 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">the Gulf</NAME>.</P> 
		  <P>The settlers on the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Cumberland</NAME> and in 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Kentucky</NAME> , were placed in
			 <HI REND="underlined">great straits</HI> not only 'betwixt two', but many
			 perplexities; treacherous and wily and cruel savages on all sides, and the
			 insidious and crafty machinations of agents of foreign governments tampering
			 with these savages and with their fellow citizens. They conceived then of none
			 of <ADD PLACE="supralinear">the</ADD> modern facilities of intercourse and
			 business across those mountains over which they had clambered with so much
			 difficulty &amp; peril; and very wisely looked to the great natural canal and
			 its tributary waters <DEL TYPE="overstrike">as their</DEL> to bear their
		  produce to any available and profitable market; and that whatsoever power had
		  its controlling &amp; strong hand upon the great artery could and would control
		  the circulation of the young and growing commerce of these vast western
		  regions: Every act affecting the free and uninterrupted flow of these important
		  life-streams, startled the youthful but giant freemen upon their borders. And
		  if there was a momentary cessation or occasional irregularity in the pulsation
		  of the great 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">American</NAME> heart, and consequent disordered
		  motions in the limbs &amp; extremities, &mdash; so that the State of 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">North Carolina</NAME> <PB N="[6]"> hesitated and
		  refused for a time to adopt the Constitution and become one of the glorious
		  Union: &mdash; though all saw &mdash; and acknowledges that the old Confederacy
		  was but a rickety and imbecile form of Government; and that something far
		  better framed &amp; compacted was needed not only for common weal, but to
		  preserve the liberties and independence so laboriously and dearly obtained;
		  &mdash; and in all these views, &mdash; even in the rejection of the new and
		  admirable form of government under which all the States have been so highly
		  prospered, and their number more than double, their population increased seven
		  fold and their commerce and business a thousand fold: &mdash; we say that
		  though the two delegates or representatives from the three counties of the 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Cumberland District</NAME> concurred in these
		  sentiments and in their own exclusion from the Union, &mdash;
		  <HI REND="underlined">it was not</HI> that they or any of them entertained
		  anti-republican opinions or were alienated from their republican brethren on
		  the Eastern side of the mountains. If they were to be detached from the great
		  family of free states, they looked to such popular government for themselves
		  &amp; their posterity, and that to a separate organization they would only
		  resort from <HI REND="underlined">dire necessity</HI>, and with the sincere
		  hope that a truce and way <PB N="[7]"> <ADD PLACE="top, right">4</ADD> would
		  ere long appear for a happy and more solid Union, and better guarantee for
		  mutual and general advantage.</P> 
		  <P>There was a variety of influences at work; &mdash;
			 <DEL TYPE="overstrike">conflicting</DEL> feelings and interests so conflicting
		  as must ever move an intelligent and independent people. There were the strong
		  ties arising from birth, education, association, &mdash; all strengthened by a
		  participation in the recent struggle for general independence. . It was hard to
		  sever these: But it must be noticed that from neither the State or Confederated
		  Government had the inhabitants on this side of the mountains received aid or
		  protection; &mdash; what they had gained and accomplished, was through their
		  own toil and suffering. <DEL TYPE="overstirke">And</DEL> They were separated at
		  that time from their friends and compatriots by mountain barriers little less
		  formidable, and rendering the connection little less distant and difficult,
		  than the broad 
		  <NAME TYPE="place"><ORIG REG="Atlantic">atlantic</ORIG></NAME> spread
		  out between the States and the mother country from which <HI
		  REND="underlined">they</HI> had recently obtained an acknowledgment of
		  independence</P> 
		  <P>The very character of late and prominent events, and the condition
			 of affairs and exigencies of the <PB N="[8]"> times forced the question of
			 self-reliance and independence upon the people: But they were in no haste to
			 divide it, &mdash; they cherished no such desire: they loved their fellow
			 citizens of the States or 'settlements,' and the liberties they had gained, and
			 the institutions they had adopted, <ORIG REG="nonetheless">none the
			 less</ORIG>, because they were 'over the hills and far away,' &mdash; and they
			 were reluctant to take a part in diplomacy, craft and intrigue: But as others
			 sought to play the game with them, and for them, as a stake, in which they were
			 to be won or lost, &mdash; it became the part of wisdom &amp; duty for the
			 party so deeply interested to use some policy <ORIG REG="likewise">like
			 wise</ORIG>. <ADD PLACE="left margin">

		  <P>The language used by 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl</ABBR>
				Robertson</NAME> is complimentary to the intelligence and foresight of the
			 great King of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Creek nation</NAME>: "You are better able to judge

		  <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="General">Genl</ABBR> Robertson</NAME>
		  knew that such a communication would be seen by other eyes and that the wishes

		  <DEL TYPE="overstrike">the</DEL> opening <ADD PLACE="supralinear">the</ADD>
		  navigation of the 
		  <NAME TYPE="place"> Mississippi</NAME>: As they were threatened and
		  tempted by officers and emissaries of foreign governments, &mdash; and were so
		  situated that of necessity <PB N="[9]"> they had to consult, negotiate, decide
		  and act without the authority or sanction of an established government: for, as
		  to the supervision and case of the State of 
		  <NAME TYPE="place"><ABBR EXPAN="North">N.</ABBR> Carolina</NAME> so far
		  as they had knowledge of either, they were unreliable or vexatious, &mdash; and
		  so continued "to the end of the chapter" &mdash; when the State of 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME> became one of the
		  <HI REND="underlined">Union</HI>. The good 'old North State' had a multitude of
		  cares and toils at home or within her old &amp; organized settlements, &mdash;
		  and could not extend her strong arm across the mountains to defend these
		  'children in the woods,' &mdash; but rather left <ORIG
		  REG="through">threw</ORIG> to the perils to which they had exposed themselves
		  &mdash; "to perils in the wilderness, to perils in robbers,' to perils of
		  foreigners &mdash; 'to perils of their own <ORIG REG="countrymen">country

		  <P>We should bear in mind that virtually there was at this period
			 <HI REND="underlined">no American Confederacy</HI>, <HI REND="underlined">no

			 <HI REND="underlined">Interregnum</HI>." The old Confederacy was dissolving and

		  <P>There was perhaps a <ORIG REG="coert">cooert</ORIG> meaning, a

			 <NAME TYPE="person">Wind Tribe</NAME> , &mdash; but there were marked

		  <NAME TYPE="person">Frenchman</NAME>, an 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">Englishman</NAME>, &mdash; and yet always an Indian
		  of the half blood.</P> 
		  <P>He was educated in

		  PLACE="supralinear">family</ADD> entitled him; and throughout the War for 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">American</NAME> Independence he was devoted to the
		  measures of 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">England</NAME>.</P> 
		  <P>At the close of that war, he entered into close alliance with the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Spanish</NAME> authorities of

			 <DATE VALUE="1784-00-00">1784</DATE>, and he assigned as his excuse

		  <P>The settlers upon the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Cumberland</NAME> had no knowledge of any such

			 the

		  <P>But in letters and documents which have since come to light, we

			 <DEL TYPE="overstrike">wishes</DEL> <ADD PLACE="supralinear">aims</ADD> of the 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">Spanish</NAME> government, &mdash; to break up the
		  settlements on the

		  the protection of the 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">Spaniards</NAME> rather than longer to rely upon

		  <P>In a letter which he addressed to

			 <NAME TYPE="place">Cumberland</NAME>, &amp; that, people there would

		  <P>The <ORIG REG="acknowledgment">acknowledgement</ORIG> has been made

			 his <ORIG REG="alleged">alledged</ORIG> losses.</P> 
		  <P>In further proof of his spirit, we quote the following remark from a

			 <DATE VALUE="1788-09-00"><ABBR EXPAN="Septermber">Septr.</ABBR>
				1788</DATE>, to <HI REND="underlined"> 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Panton</NAME></HI>, a

			 <HI REND="underlined">point of sword</HI>, &mdash; particularly with 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Americans</NAME>." And in this same letter he
			 speaks boastingly of "an attack made by "a party of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokees</NAME> on a body of the
			 <HI REND="underlined"> 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Franklin</NAME></HI> troops,' &mdash; in which he
			 rejoices that the latter were completely routed, &mdash; and that this being
			 "The first check they ever got in that country, the drooping spirits of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Cherokees</NAME> were thereby revived."</P> 
		  <P>This, no doubt, is alluded to in that paragraph of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR>
				Robertson's</NAME> letter where he says, "It is reported that the inhabitants
