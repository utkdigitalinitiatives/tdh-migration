			 <SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER> 
		  <P>I was at the City when the Convention with the Cherokees was made

		  <NAME TYPE="place"><ABBR EXPAN="United">U</ABBR> States</NAME>all their

		  <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee <ORIG REG="River">river</ORIG></NAME>
		  which intersected by the Eastern boundary of 
		  <NAME TYPE="place">Madison County</NAME> to the line agreed upon by the
		  said convention. The Cherokee Deputation did not Consider themselves
		  <ORIG REG="authorized">authorised</ORIG> to cede land. Before I came away the
		  secretary told me that a treaty would be ordered to be held in order to obtain
		  some cessions of land from the Cherokees &amp; that I must make my best
		  exertions to effect the Objects. I am now instructed <PB N="[2]"> to open
