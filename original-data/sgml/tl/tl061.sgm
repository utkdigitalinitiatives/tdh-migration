			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written to Benjamin
				Hawkins, the Agent and Superintendent of the Creek Nation, by Governor John
				Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on December 20, 1807. Governor Sevier discusses
				the robbery and murder of two men from Tennessee, and that he suspects a member
				of the Creek Nation as the murderer. He asks the agent to investigate the
				situation and try to discover if a Creek Indian committed the murders. He
				claims that several parties of Creek Indians passed through the area of the
				killings around the same time and that these parties robbed and plundered
				several of the families in the area. Governor Sevier requests that the Creek
				chiefs put an end to the violence and migration of their people onto other
				lands.</NOTE>

		  <P>Early in the last spring and summer two men Citizens of 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME>, in the vicinity of 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Elk River</NAME>, were murdered and
			 <ORIG REG="Robbed">Robed</ORIG> of their property in a most
			 <ORIG REG="barbarious">barbarous</ORIG> and egregious manner &mdash; Myself and
			 
			 <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Colo.</ABBR> Meigs</NAME>
			 agent for the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Cherokee Nation</NAME> , have been at considerable
			 trouble and pains to find out and ascertain who were the perpetrators of such
			 shocking and unprovoked outrages. From every information we have collected, it
			 appears and leaves with us no doubt, that some persons belonging to the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Creek nation</NAME> have been guilty of those
			 atrocious and horrid murders. I am unwilling to suppose that the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creek</NAME> <ORIG REG="chiefs">cheifs</ORIG>
			 would be base enough to encourage, or countenance such flagrant, and violent
			 breaches of the existing Treaties, which subsist between them and the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>. I therefore request that you
			 will have, or cause to be had, an immediate enquiry and investigation, and
			 discover if possible, who have been the perpetrators of such bloody and Inhuman
			 murders; and if committed by any of the people belonging to the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Creek nation</NAME>, that you cause them to be
			 instantly punished <ORIG REG="agreeably">agreably</ORIG> to the existing
			 Treaties and laws of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>, made and provided for in
			 such Cases; otherwise, to deliver them to the proper Authority in order they
			 may be dealt with conformably to the Treaties and laws Aforesaid &mdash;
			 <ADD PLACE="bottom right">It is</ADD> <PB N="[2]"> It is a fact, that parties
			 of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creek Indians</NAME> have crossed the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME> frequently in the course of the
			 last Spring and summer, and as frequently (exclusively of the murders alluded
			 to) wantonly <ORIG REG="robbed">robed</ORIG> and plundered a number of
			 peaceable and helpless families &mdash; Such enormities will not always be
			 submitted to, and in order to support peace and harmony, the Executive of 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME>, most earnestly request that the
			 <ORIG REG="Chiefs">Cheifs</ORIG>, will <ORIG
			 REG="immediately">immeadiately</ORIG> repress and put an end to such Violent
			 outrages, and cause such lawless <ORIG REG="Bandits">Banditties</ORIG>, to
			 remain within their own bounds &mdash; The Executive is penetrated with a due
			 friendship to the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Creek nation</NAME>; he might enlarge further on
			 such a state of things, and circumstances so important, and so unexpected. but
			 it would be as afflicting to him to state the facts, as it would be for you to
			 hear them &mdash;</P>
