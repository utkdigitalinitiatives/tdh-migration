			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter dated February 10,
				1797, addressed to the warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation by Governor
				John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801). Sevier sent his apologies for the recent
				violence that had been committed against several of the Cherokees. He also
				criticized the chiefs for not making any complaints about these actions, for it
				impeded the process of apprehending the perpetrators. Sevier stated that
				although the murders of two Cherokees were committed in Kentucky, the murderers
				were from Tennessee. Sevier, however, changed his tone when he began to speak
				of crimes committed against White people by Cherokees. He warned them that if
				such actions did not cease, it would bring about a war, which would have
				disastrous consequences for the Cherokee Nation.</NOTE>
