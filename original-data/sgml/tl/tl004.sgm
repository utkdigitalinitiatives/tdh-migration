				written by Archibald Roane, Governor of the State of Tennessee, to the citizens
				of Anderson County, Tennessee. Roane intended to address this letter to the
				citizens who were presently residing on lands that had been guaranteed to
				Indians, and he warned them that prosecution would be brought against them if
				they failed to remove themselves. Roane stated that the Indians were demanding
				their rightful land, and the federal government would comply with those
				demands, be it by legal prosecution, removal by troops, or both. </NOTE>

		  <ADD PLACE="supralinear">sent me a</ADD> letter in his official capacity
		  containing a list of a number of names <DEL TYPE="overstrike">stated by
		  him</DEL> of persons (as he says) residing on Indian lands contrary to treaty
		  and that the Indians demanded <ORIG REG="their">thier</ORIG> removal. He says
		  that the President is determined to prevent all such intrusions and that
		  <ADD PLACE="supralinear">&caret; he ( 
		  <NAME TYPE="person"><ABBR EXPAN="Colonel">Col</ABBR>
			 Meigs</NAME>)</ADD> by his orders <DEL TYPE="overstrike">he</DEL> is bound to
		  take effectual measures to have all such settlers removed. Whether this will be

		  federal troops or both, I have not been informed</P> 
		  <P>Knowing <DEL TYPE="overstrike">this to be the case</DEL> these facts
		  I think it a duty I owe you as Citizens of

		  <P>In my official capacity as Governor of the state I have nothing to
			 do in any business of this nature. The federal authority <DEL
		  TYPE="overstrike"><UNCLEAR>above</UNCLEAR></DEL> It is committed by an
		  <DEL TYPE="overstrike">unc</DEL> act of Congress and over that authority I have

		  from yourselves. But if you should think otherwise it might perhaps be proper
		  to <ADD PLACE="supralinear">decline</ADD><DEL TYPE="overstrike">avoid</DEL>
