			 <NOTE TYPE="summary"> This document is a letter addressed to the
				warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, written by Governor John Sevier of
				Tennessee (1796-1801) and dated January 12, 1797. The letter was given to
				Cherokee agent Silas Dinsmore to be read aloud to the Cherokee. In his letter,
				Sevier accused some Cherokees of stealing horses and plundering wagons that had
				passed through the Cumberland road. Sevier laid the blame on "foolish young
				people" within the Cherokee Nation but hoped the chiefs and warriors were not
				encouraging such acts. Sevier urged the Cherokee leaders to work with Dinsmore
				in getting the stolen property returned. Sevier also expressed condolences for
				the murder of an Indian and stated that he doubted any of his people would do
				such a thing. The letter was initially ended on a note of warning to the
				Cherokee, as Sevier insinuated that if they continued their aggressive
				behavior, war would be option. However, the last two sections of the original
				letter were deleted from the final text.</NOTE>
