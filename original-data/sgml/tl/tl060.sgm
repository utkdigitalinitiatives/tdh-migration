				August 2, 1807. In the letter, Sevier discussed the murders of two white men,

			 may be dealt with agreeably to existing Treaties, and the laws in such cases
			 made and provided. I am unwilling to believe that the Cherokee chiefs would
			 countenance such outrages, but should it be discovered to be otherwise, this
			 situation may soon become very disagreeable, unless they finally put an end to
			 such aggressions. I shall expect that the Cherokees will make every necessary
