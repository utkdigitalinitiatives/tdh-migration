			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written by General
				James L. Robertson to Colonel David Henley of Knoxville, dated October 24,
				1795. In the letter, Robertson warned Henley about the Creek Indians, who,
				although they appeared to be seeking peace with the United States and
				neighboring tribes, had been instigating hostilities with the Chickasaw
				Indians. Robertson described a battle between the two tribes, which he stated
				was initiated by a Creek offensive, yet concluded by a Chickasaw victory.
				Robertson explained that the attack would prevent the Chickasaws from hunting,
				which in turn would require the US government to send more provisions. The
				letter concluded with Robertson offering Henley a proposal to purchase land.
				Enclosed with the letter was a copy of a letter written by Chickasaw chief
				Pioming (referred to by Robertson as Opiomingo), which further described the
				Creeks' hostility and asked for assistance from the US government.</NOTE>

		  <P>Although the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME> are at peace with the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">United States</NAME>, the deceptive conduct they

			 &amp; the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Chickasaws</NAME> at the very time they were

			 and actually marching <UNCLEAR>against (document damaged)</UNCLEAR> them,
			 cannot be pleasing, or promise any <UNCLEAR>Just (document damaged)</UNCLEAR>
			 grounds for a reliance on their Talks. This morning 
			 <NAME REG="person">Sergeant Casselman</NAME> returned from the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Chickasaw Nation</NAME> with the following
			 information&lowbar; that about the 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-00-20">20th</DATE> 
			 <ABBR EXPAN="Ultimo">Ultim</ABBR> A large body of 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME> attacked the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Chickasaws</NAME> in their Town, no doubt, with
			 intent to reduce some of their Forts as the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME> had Stocks <UNCLEAR>prepared

		  <P>The Land I was offering to you, I have sold for one thousand
