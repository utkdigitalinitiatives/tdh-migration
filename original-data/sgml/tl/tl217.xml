The document was a product of a Constitutional Convention of 1827, headed by John Ross, who was elected the first Chief of the Cherokee Nation when the constitution was put into effect the following year.  In the constitution, which was largely patterned after the United States', the Cherokees referred to themselves as a sovereign entity and outlined  three branches of government.  Although the Constitution of the Cherokee Nation was largely developed in order to prevent the forced removal of the Cherokee, it was only ten years after its adoption that the Cherokee were ultimately displaced.    </note><note type="collection"> Constitution of the Cherokee Nation </note><note type="box">Tennessee State Library, Miscellaneous documents</note><note type="folder">n/a</note><note type="document">tl217</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Cherokee Indians -- Politics and government</item><item>Cherokee Indians -- Legal status, laws, etc.</item><item>Sovereignty</item><item>Southeastern U.S.</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="legal"><pb n="[1]"/><p><add place="top right">1</add> We the Representatives of the people of the <name type="place">Cherokee Nation</name>, in Convention assembled in order to establish justice ensure tranquility, promote our common welfare, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of liberty acknowledging with humility and gratitude the goodness of the sovereign ruler of the Universe <orig reg="affording">offording</orig> us an opportunity so favorable to the design and imploring his aid and direction in its accomplishments do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Government of the Cherokee Nation.</p><p>Article 1st.</p><p>The boundaries of this nation embracing the lands solemnly guaranteed and reserved forever to the Cherokee Nation the treaties concluded with the <name type="place">United States</name> is as follows, and which shall forever hereafter remain unalterably the same; To wit: Beginning on the north bank of <name type="place">Tennessee River</name> at the <orig reg="upper">uper</orig> part of the <name type="place">Chickasaw Old Fields</name> thence along the main Channel of said River <add place="supralinear">including</add> all the islands therein to the mouth of <name type="place">Highwassee River</name> thence up the main channel of said river including Islands to the first Hill which closes in on said river about two miles above <name type="place">highwassee Old Town</name>  thence along the ridge which divides the waters of the <name type="place">highwassee Little Tellico</name> , to the Tennessee river at <name type="place">Tallassee</name> thence along the main channel including Islands to the junction of <name type="place">Cowee</name> &amp; <name type="place">Nonteyalee</name> thence along the ridge in the fork of <pb n="[2]"/> said river to the top of the blue ridge, thence along the blue ridge to the <name type="place">Unicoy Turnpike road</name> thence a straight line to the nearest main source of the <name type="place">Chestotee</name> ; thence along its main channel, including Islands to the <name type="place">Chatahoochie</name> and thence down the same to the Creek boundary at <name type="place">Buzzard roast</name>, thence along the boundary line which separates this and the <name type="place">Creek Nation</name>, to a point on the <name type="place">Coosa river</name> opposite the mouth of <name type="place">Wills Creek</name> thence down along the South Bank of the same to a point, opposite <name type="place">Fort Strothers</name> thence up the river <add place="supralinear">to</add> the mouth of Wills Creek, thence up along the east Bank of said Creek to the west branch, thereof and up the same to its source &amp; thence along the ridge which <orig reg="separates">seperates</orig> the <name type="place">Tombigby</name> &amp; Tennessee waters, to a point on the top of said ridge thence a due north Course to <name type="place">Camp Coffee</name>, on Tennessee which is opposite the <name type="place">Chickasaw Island</name>, thence to a place of beginning</p><p>Section 2.
