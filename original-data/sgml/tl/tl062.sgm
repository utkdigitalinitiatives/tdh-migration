			 <NOTE TYPE="summary">This document is a letter written by Governor
				John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Black Fox, Chief of the Cherokee Nation,
				dated December 20, 1807. In the letter, Sevier acknowledges that it was the
				Creeks that murdered two white men and not the Cherokees, as was previously
				under investigation. Sevier also expresses his resentment and distrust for the
				Creek Nation, and he condemns the Cherokee for allowing Creeks to pass through
				and settle in their nation. Sevier encourages Black Fox not to let the Creek
				settle on their land since they rob and murder both the Cherokee and the white
				people in the area. He also adds that there have been complaints that some
				Cherokees have robbed and threatened white settlers in the area, and he
				requests that they be punished and compensate the white settlers.</NOTE>

		  <P>Your letter of the 
			 <DATE VALUE="0000-08-027">27 of August</DATE> last have come duly to
			 hand &mdash; I would have wrote you some time ago, but was waiting to get a
			 report from 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Colonel Meigs</NAME> to find out if
			 <DEL TYPE="overstrike">possible</DEL> in our powers who, or what nation of
		  people had murdered some of our Citizens &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>The Colonel about that time was going to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Elk River</NAME>, and promised he would endeavor
			 to find out who had done the <ORIG REG="mischief">mischeif</ORIG>, Since his
			 return he has Written to me giving information, that it was the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME> that killed the two men &mdash; I
			 am glad to hear it was not your people; but at the same time I am sorry to
			 learn You suffer the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME> to come so much among you, when you
			 know they are enemies to our people, and always do <ORIG
			 REG="mischief">mischeif</ORIG> <ORIG REG="whenever">when ever</ORIG> they have
			 it in their power &mdash; Would you not think it unfriendly in us, if we are to
			 suffer another nation of people to pass through and live in our Country, who
			 would murder and destroy your people <ORIG REG="Whenever">When ever</ORIG> they
			 had an opportunity? Yes brother you would think and rightly too, that we did
			 not act like friends. I am informed that the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME> have built Huts, and is living on
			 the banks of the 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Tennessee</NAME>; what business have they there?
			 They have none only to be convenient to kill some of our people, and plunder
			 our Boats as they are going down the River &mdash; You know the 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Creek</NAME> people are <DEL
		  TYPE="overstrike">Rougues Roug</DEL> Rogues, and you say steal from and
		  <ORIG REG="rob">robb</ORIG> your own people: If it be true, why
		  <ORIG REG="don't">dont</ORIG> you drive them from out of your Country? for a
		  people who both murder &amp; steals, <ORIG REG="ought">aught</ORIG> not to be
		  Suffered to live in any place &mdash; You are Surely <ADD
		  PLACE="bottom right">able</ADD> <PB N="[2]"> able to drive away the few that
		  comes to do <ORIG REG="mischief">Mischeif</ORIG>, and disturb the peace of your
		  people and ours: If their nation means to protect them in their murdering and
		  plundering excursions, you then know where you can resort to for protection and
		  Strength enough to do <ORIG REG="yourselves">your selves</ORIG> Justice &mdash;
		  I state these circumstances to inform You how you <ORIG
		  REG="ought">aught</ORIG> to conduct towards the white people, who are your
		  Fathers, Brothers, friends, and your good neighbors. I <ORIG
		  REG="don't">dont</ORIG> wish to be angry with you, but to enlighten your
		  understandings that you may know how to take care of your own nation (if you
		  wish to continue such); and for you to prevent a bad people from doing damage
		  to your nearest and best friends &mdash; You say "that when
		  <ORIG REG="anything">any thing</ORIG> has been wrong we are advised to settle
		  it without spilling blood." Such is the practice I wish to see adopted, and if
		  the red people that killed our good and harmless men, had observed such a good
		  rule, those poor murdered <DEL TYPE="overstrike">men</DEL> persons would have
		  yet been living with their families, and their blood not spilt. I have written
		  to the 
		  <NAME TYPE="person">Creeks</NAME>, and shall wait patiently to hear
		  what they have to say, and if it has been any of their people that committed
		  the murders, I shall expect they will punish them <ORIG

		  <P>Some more <ORIG REG="occurrences">occurrances</ORIG> my friend I
			 must inform you of, <ORIG REG="there">their</ORIG> is several complaints come
			 forward, stating, that Several white people who have traveled by the way of

			 <ADD PLACE="bottom right">lives</ADD><PB N="[3]"> lives threatened and

			 your nation to 
			 <NAME TYPE="place">Georgia</NAME>; He also presented his gun at 
			 <NAME TYPE="person">Mr. Lush </NAME>(who is a very peaceable man) and

			 such unfriendly and disorderly behavior; and also cause a just and full
			 compensation to be made for the damages that have been done &mdash;</P> 
		  <P>The way open for the Redress of these complaints is to put an end to
