If I am correct  in my views among this family, Fanny and children, there are several that is of no service at this time and will not be for some time to come, why then purchase negroes from which no revenue can be derived, I suppose one negro would do Brothers probably as well as another, as I presume he is too indolent for any use.</p><p>Please write me the age &amp;  size &amp; appearance of all the family and what you consider the fair value of each one (please get Butler's aid in doing so) and whether you believe they would be worth as much to Sarah the the same <abbr expan="amount">amt</abbr>. of money invested in other negroes.
