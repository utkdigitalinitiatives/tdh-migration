But's health is not very good, Eve &amp; myself are quite well.</p><p>We got through rolling our crop our week ago, &amp; in consequence of the extremely dry weather &amp; a continuation of it so long, my crop did not yield <orig reg="more">mor</orig> so well as we at first anticipated, I made 390.000 <abbr expan="pounds">lbs</abbr> &amp; about 700 <orig reg="barrels">barels</orig> of molasses, although every crop was not good it was the best in our parish to the fored, and will I think nett me after paying transportation expenses, commissions <unclear>&amp;c&amp;c</unclear> something like $22,000, my corn crop is not so good, but believe I have enough.  The Cotton crops very very much, some good, some tolerably so, &amp; others very bad, but the price bring so good it remunerates the planters well, I should have made more at it than sugar this year, but it has become so uncertain a crop here, that I think on the whole that sugar will be best, my great objection to the cotton is the immense outlay to prepare for the making it.  My great hope &amp; expectation is, (as it has already been partly accomplished) that this colonigative society, by its buying up this slave coast in <name>Africa</name> &amp; the influence that it will naturally wield, will in a great measure, if not entirely abolish the carrying if african negroes to <name>South America,</name> <name>Cuba</name> &amp; other <name>west India</name> islands, when that is completed, <name>Louisiana</name> sugar will pay well, without our government coming to our aid, by laying a high tariff on imported sugars.</p><pb n="[3]"/><p>I have never heard from you whether you received the money remitted to you by my <unclear>murcht</unclear>, for the payment of the girl bought for Sarah, although I presume you have, in whose name was the title taken? if in <unclear>Lasah</unclear>, is there no danger in her being taken for old debts? I ask, as I do not know any thing on <abbr expan="Tennessee">Tenn</abbr>. laws.  How is Brother doing? is he making a respectable support? is he industrious? and will he ever be able to get along.  This is all confidential.</p><p>I have a great desire to see Sarah comfortable, &amp; will do what I can to attain that end, and feel confident that she will do her part, but I am afraid that B. is too inert, and has too little energy.  I am urging <unclear>Imus</unclear> to forward Sarah's negroes to her, &amp; have recently given him a good scolding about his negligence, and hope he will attend to it this spring </p><p>Where may we look for Tom Butler, I have not heard a word from him for a long time.  The <unclear>Bishman</unclear> ready to pay him, when he has his wife's signature to the sale of the land.  so they say.  Cant you &amp; cousin P. come down this spring, nothing would please us so much.  I calculate to go north next summer if nothing occurs to prevent me, I should go on one of the steam pockets to <name>New York</name>, and can not now say whether I should return by <abbr expan="Tennessee"><name>Tenn</name></abbr>. or not The sole object of my visit is to reinstate my constitution that is more or less impaired by <unclear>exposure</unclear>, and remaining a long time in a southern climate, &amp; absenting myself one season from my business will accomplish it, at any rate to a certain extent. My intuition is to travel &amp; not spend any time at any particular place</p><pb n="[4]"/><p>Aunt Overton and family are well, her crop is not good this season, the old lady looks well and is very industrious.</p><p>Bethiah &amp; Over join me in my love &amp; best wishes &amp; Kind remembrance to yourself, cousin P. &amp; family, old aunt, Tom, cousin P. &amp; family, Jim &amp; Mitty &amp; all enquiring friends.  who did <name>May's Tucker</name> marry, give him my best respects.  also to my little namesake Tom, </p><p>Write me all the news, &amp; all about Sarahs situation- Accept for all the best wishes of <abbr expan="Colonel">Col </abbr>King</p> <closer>Your Friend &amp; Relative <signed><abbr expan="Thomas">Tho</abbr>.
