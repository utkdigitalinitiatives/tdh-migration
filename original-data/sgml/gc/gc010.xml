I at one time enjoyed the pleasing hope, that we are many years resolved,  should become near  neighbors in this pleasant, and salubrious clime; but hearing that you have again entered in the delightful pursuits  of Agriculture in your State.  precludes all hope of enjoying that pleasure I fondly anticipated.   </p>  <p>It is a source of much regret with me.  to hear that you have earnestly and warmly selected the   fair hands of an amiable and accomplished girl, and that you have been <orig reg="unsuccessful">unsuccessfull</orig>.  This is a check that has rendered the life, of many a   promising youth, a misery to himself and a pest to society,  But I trust your firmness, and good sense, will counteract such effects, and that you will engage again  in the pursuit of a companion, possessing such qualities as will render you a useful and happy Citizen.  You must recollect that women are capricious, and that a Revolution in the Moon, or two causes a change in their opinion; I would therefore pursue the warm track as often as the Moon undergoes a revolution <pb n="[3]"/> in twelve  months, , and for a  small premium, I would warrant your success.  No doubt you are getting tired of this subject, therefore I leave it.  <name type="person"><abbr expan="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> &amp; Devane King</name>, arrive here about the <date value="1820-11-25">25th of <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr></date>, they bring so many of a pleasing nature, Money very scarce.  and many people entirely ruined, amongst others <name type="person">J.

Our crop is not very good we made about 4,000 Bushel Corn, and about 40.000 <add place="supralinear"><unclear>lb</unclear></add> Cotton.  I think upon the whole you had better visit the Macidore girl, and come and Settle on those rich <orig reg="prairies">praires</orig>.

The family all joins in love to you</p> <closer><salute>I am your friend.</salute><signed>Wm G Parrish</signed><add place="bottom left of page">to James M King</add></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
