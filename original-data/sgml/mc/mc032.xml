And now when I commence a letter to you, I can think of nothing worth writing except to tell you how anxious I am to see you and Eliza and that little boy&mdash; the weather has moderated very much by a few cold Northern winds, causing the nights to become quite cool, <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> the <sic>the</sic> middle of &caret;<add place="supralinear">the</add> days are still very warm; during which time we generally lounge under the awning in front of our tents when we have no military duty to perform&mdash;The nights are most lovely and bright, as you may judge from the fact that I am writing this letter by moonlight alone. Perhaps we have in <name type="place">Tennessee</name> as &caret;<add place="supralinear">bright nights as</add> they are here, but there we have not often more than two or three such nights in succession, whilst here they are seldom obscured by a single cloud. As my comrade <name type="person">Winship</name>  (who has recovered from the measles and this evening returned to our Quarters) would say I am writing by moonlight for "<orig reg="grandeur">grandour</orig>"&mdash; for indeed I can see much better by candle light than by moonshine, bright and beautiful as it is. I have just heard to-day, that our Cavalry Regiment had reached <name type="place">San Antonio,</name> &mdash; that supplies could not be had for them to recruit at that place&mdash;and that <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Wool</name> had ordered them to <name type="person">Port Lavaca,</name>  which by reference to the map you will see is a long ways behind the Head Quarters of the Army, and I doubt if ever they can get up with their horses in condition to render any service&mdash;<name type="person"> <abbr expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Pillows</name> Brigade is now moving forward, and we shall probably go ourselves next week to <name type="place">Monterey </name>&mdash; I am anxious to go up, not only because of  the great battle fought there&mdash; and of the advanced position we shall be placed in, but because too, the country is described as most abundantly supplied with grain, cattle, fruits, <abbr expan="and et cetera">&amp;c</abbr> (none of which we get here) but it is said to be a most salubrious and delightful climate&mdash; I have heard very little more more of the particulars and incidents of the battle than I had heard when I wrote to you last&mdash;I have not yet heard what <name type="person">Bob Foster</name> done there, but having a list of the officers who were killed and wounded in the storming of Monterey (<abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> not of a single private) and his name is not on that list&mdash; I know however that he has done, and behaved well. for even the Regular officers say the <orig reg="Tennesseans">Tennesseeans</orig>, all, fought like Trojans&mdash; <pb n="[2]"/> I have not written a word of advice about our business at home, because what I <orig reg="might">migh</orig> say might be inconsistent with circumstances of which I am ignorant&mdash; But I will make some suggestions, which you will not however regard unless you shall think them advisable under all &caret;<add place="supralinear">existing</add> circumstances&mdash; In the first place&mdash; If you could hire <name type="person">Mr. Foel</name> (who was employed by <name type="person">Mr.  Long</name> last year) to take charge of the farm&mdash;it would enable you to keep Thomas at home. And you might afford to give him a liberal price, perhaps best to have in the the contract that he should be paid out of the proceeds of the crop&mdash; <name type="person">Mr. Taylor</name> could and would make a contract with him&mdash; But you can either do this&mdash; or continue the farm as it has been, or rent out the farm and hire out the boys&mdash; for <abbr expan="although">altho'</abbr> I may get home (if peace should be concluded) soon after you receive this, yet I may be detained in the service until the end of my term of 12 months&mdash; If I am, however I shall save out of my wages from $80.. to $100.. per month&mdash; Tho' I do not know that I shall have any means of making you a remittance, and if I had, I have no certainty of drawing my pay as it falls due, I have only drawn one month wages, and the paymaster has no money here now, whilst a great many soldiers have not drawn a cent&mdash; It seems to me, too, that some measures ought to be taken to collect the debts due from<name type="person"> Biggs</name> and<name type="person"> Eaton,</name>  for I cannot believe those debts have been paid,&mdash;Still if Eaton should make a liberal payment, perhaps it would be good policy to indulge him for a part&mdash;<abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> I suppose we will <orig reg="lose">loose</orig> the Nance debt which might have been saved by an earlier proceeding as you advised me often; and for this&caret;<add place="supralinear">with many, very many other things</add> I have much confidence in your<orig reg="judgement"> judment,</orig> and leave all to your discretion&mdash; Mr. Taylor, you remember, has my notes&mdash; If you think advisable to sue; any person, some of the lawyers will attend to it for me&mdash;If you can have any debts collected or can realize any of the proceeds of the dues by notes, fees or otherwise, use all that  you <sic>you</sic> require for your comfort, in the most extensive signification of that word comfort&mdash; If you cannot have collected as much as you thus need, borrow as much from <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Brazelton</name>&mdash;I can, when I return, very conveniently manage the balance of my debts when I return&mdash; <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Pillow is very rich, being worth perhaps 200,000$, he is a good financier. and says he will put me in a way to make some money, but I do not depend on this, for I know of no way he can do so, by any means which I could accept&mdash;I wrote to <name type="person">Mr. McClung</name>&caret;<add place="supralinear">or told him</add> I would move with him to<name type="place"> Texas</name>&mdash; but home seems to now, as so sweet and dear a place, I do not feel as if I would be willing to exchange it, for any other&mdash; I have not received a letter from you since I left home, except the one that was brought me by<name type="person"><abbr expan="Lieutenent"> Lieut.</abbr> Turnley</name>&mdash; And you must know that I am anxious to hear from, It is  <orig reg="owing">oweing</orig> to the negligence no doubt of our Post Masters between this place and <name type="place">Orleans&mdash;</name> I imagine however that <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> my letters may have meet with some delay, yet that you receive them with much more regularity, and certainty&mdash;<pb n="[3]"/> In my speculations about the time when the happy day shall arrive, in which I shall meet you again, I am guided by my conjectures about the duration of the war, and my opinion <abbr expan="though">tho </abbr> based upon uncertainties numerous, and many of them far fetched is, that we shall have a treaty of peace concluded. But if this should be so, or whether it is or not, I cannot calculate upon getting home again earlier than the first of February next&mdash; Which seems so very long, that it almost drowns with despair, my anxious hopes of return. But anxious as I am to return, I am not satisfied for the war to end at what it now stands, I hope to have one brush with the Mexicans myself. I have been apprehensive that I should be reproached at home for leaving my company and accepting my present situation in <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Pillows staff&mdash; Because when I left <name type="place">Knoxville</name> <del type="overstrike">my</del> the friends there of my men expected me to take care of them&mdash; My great inducement to come forward was the expectation of being in the fight which all the time I have expected would take place about Monterey; and in which I knew my company <del type="overstrike">company</del> could not get up in time &caret;<add place="supralinear">to</add> participate&mdash; Besides if they had come forward instead of going to<name type="place"> Lavaca,</name> I think I have the ear of the Generals so as to &caret;<add place="supralinear">have</add> <orig reg="rendered">renderd</orig> them some favors&mdash; besides I did not know how I could have rendered them any service upon their march, now I think the best service I can render them will be to obtain orders for them to march away from the south into a more congenial climate&mdash; If I can get them forward so as to take part in the next fight I will join them, if I cannot get them forward, I will try and get myself forward. In my former letters, I have told you much about myself and no important changes having taken place in my manner of life since that I need not write at this time any more upon that subject&mdash; I have written one letter to <name type="person">Alfred</name>&mdash; And I have written to <name type="person">A.R. Crozier</name> giving him a sketch of the battle at Monterey&mdash; Please preserve all the papers in which you can find any reference to me, my company, <abbr expan="and et cetera">&amp;c</abbr>&mdash; I will write to <abbr expan="General">Gen. </abbr>Brazelton I think by next mail. A son of <name type="person">Mr. Ross</name> from <name type="place">Anderson County </name>has been discharged. If he should return home by the first steamer I will send this letter by him&mdash; Give my love to Eliza. I wish she could be at school. And on that account I am anxious to return home, so that I may keep you company whilst she is about. Kiss the little boy for me&mdash; and give my love to your Ma.</p><closer><salute>Your Affectionate Husband</salute><signed><abbr expan="William Richard">Wm.
