They buy in small amounts at 8, and sell at 9 or 10.  One to whom I spoke said he could accommodate you with 7 or 8 thousand dollars at almost any time in Kentucky paper for Tennessee &amp; <name>Alabama</name> at 10, or in U.S. paper, so as to enable you to get Kentucky paper at about the same difference.  The difference between U.S. paper &amp; <abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr> here is 2, so that you would have to pay 12 for U.S. in <abbr expan="Tennessee">Ten.</abbr> or Ala. paper.</p><p>Give my respects to <unclear>Chilton</unclear>, Hogan, <name><abbr expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Bradford</name> their families, and all my friends.</p><closer><salute>Yours truly</salute><signed><name>R.
