And now when I have set down to write to you; I have to say in the beginning, that I can write nothing that will be of interest to you, except that, which relates particularly to the family.  A few days past Father sent us your letter of March the 31; In regard to which, I have truly to say, that no <orig reg="intelligence">inteligence</orig>, ever reached us, from you, from which we derived so little pleasure.  To hear that any of you is well, is indeed, to us, at all times the greatest  satisfaction; but to hear of your <unclear>distresses</unclear> of sickness and death is equally grievous.  And I have only to <add>state</add> that they do not reside upon you alone, but are mutual;  Further more they are such as none can change <add>or</add> amend.</p><p>We have a letter here, that was written by brother Lewis to Father a few days after he reached <name><orig reg="Terre Haute">Taroahote</orig></name>.  He <pb n="[2]"/> informs us, that journey was a very pleasant one, that had seen many of his acquaintances on his way and has reached his place of destination without any difficulty.  He farther stated, that he was attending to his official duty <orig reg="during">dureing</orig> the day, and studying the law at night.  His health is also very good.  Sister Catharine wrote to me a few days since she is well and very well pleased with <name>New Echota</name>; <name>Mr Lenoir</name> will remain there untill fall, when they expects to return to <name>Roane County</name>.__ Mary <abbr expan="Jane">J.</abbr> is boarding with <name>Dr Jordan</name>, and is attending the <orig reg="academy">accadamy</orig> in <name>Kingston</name>. Franklin is going  to school here.  Frederick and myself, as you <orig reg="perhaps">perhapse</orig> have learned, did not return home this last vacation at all.   This was owing to our being very busily engaged in a review of some of our studies;  and we supposed we could employ our time here more advantageously <del type="overstrike">here</del> than elsewhere.  Our College commenced about a week ago, with prospects of a fine school.  we have students here from  many of the different states; but most of those who are from a distance are from <abbr expan="Alabama">Ala.</abbr> It is my intention at present to complete my education <orig reg="during">dureing</orig> the present <orig reg="session">sesion</orig>; but what I shall do next winter I can not say with  <pb n="[3]"/> certainty; <orig reg="though">thoug</orig> I would prefer reading history next winter preparatory to the study of a profession in the spring.</p><p>You can see from the hand write and diction of this letter, that I have  been in great haste; you will therefore excuse many of the more gross errors.- -- I hope you will not be backward to write to me as soon as you receive this communication, as I am <orig reg="very">verry</orig> anxious to know how sister Caroline is, and how all the rest of you are doing.  Tell them all they must write to us often, I have not received a line from any of you <gap reason="hole in document"/> I left you.  They were all well last week <gap/> home; but were complaining very much of the drouth. Fred, Franklin &amp; myself wish to be remembered to you all; and as to yourself <orig reg="please">pleas</orig> <orig reg="accept">except</orig> my best wishes as a testimony of an affectionate brother,</p>   <closer><signed><name>James M.
