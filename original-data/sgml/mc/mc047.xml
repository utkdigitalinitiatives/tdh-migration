I certainly thought, when I left Alabama, that I would have written to you long before this time; but by some means or other, I adopted a species of procrastination which, it would seem, had well nigh prevent me from writing at all.</p><p>After leaving <name>Gunters Landing</name>, I passed through <name>Winchester</name>, <name><orig reg="Murfreesboro">Murfreesborough</orig></name>, <name>Nashville</name> __ Crossed <name>the Ohio</name> at <name>Evansville</name>, &amp; proceeded up the <name>Habash valley</name> to this place.</p><p>In Winchester, I saw Furney; two of the <name>Miller France's</name> sons, (viz), Woodson &amp; Hugh_ I also saw little <name>James C. F. Mitchell</name>, he did not appear to be in very good health_ he thought he would spend April, his vacation month, in Talladega; but as you say nothing about it, I suppose he changed his plans___ I advised him to go to <name>Knoxville</name>; but I do not know whether or not he will conclude to do so</p><p>In Murfreesborough, I saw <name><abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Eagleton</name> _ he recollected brother William perfectly well_ he knew him only as a little school boy, but heard of him as he grew up__ he spoke very <unclear>feelingly</unclear> on the subject of his early death <abbr expan="et cetera">&amp;c</abbr></p><p>I spent a day with my old friend Yoakum_ We were, of course, glad to see each other_ We sat up late at night talking over old matters &amp; old times _ hundreds of questions and answers passed to &amp; fro. &amp;c &amp;c</p><p>In Nashville, I saw <name>Meigs</name>, Miller Frances, <name>Judge Reese</name>, two of the young Scotts from Knoxville,  Luke &amp; John Lea, <name>Dr Lindsey</name><abbr expan="President">Presdt</abbr> of the Nashville university, <name><abbr expan="Major">Majr.</abbr> Rutledge</name>, <name>F. B. Fogg</name> <abbr expan="Esquire">Esqr.</abbr> &amp;c, &amp;c, _ I spent three or four days there very pleasantly _ indeed my whole return trip was a pleasant one, having in general good weather, good roads &amp;c,</p><p>Edmund &amp; his colt spent a considerable portion of their time in dashing through the woods by the way_ They made a  real <pb n="[2]"/> <name>John Gilpen's</name> race of it; frequently losing saddle-bags, hot &amp; large portions of the wig_ Once the colt turned him a beautiful <orig reg="somersault">somerset</orig> into the middle of the road; then dashed through the woods until he lost every thing but the bridle, and came gently back, as if to see what harm he had done._ When Edmund  arrived at this place, he was rather a scabby looking subject; for between the brush, briars, &amp; a few <unclear>fisty cuffs</unclear> with the bays on the road, he had lost nearly all the skin from his neck &amp; face.</p><p>After I arrived at this place I kept the colt in town for five of six weeks, &amp; no person rode him except myself; but he became worse &amp; worse every day; until finally I had to turn him out in pasture where he is at present_ He is in fine plight_ and so wild that no person can touch him except myself.</p><p>In Winchester, Murfreesborough, &amp; Nashville I heard a <orig reg="rumor">romour</orig> that Catharine was married; but as I was then so recently from home, I was disposed to doubt its correctness nor did I know that it was certainly so, until within the last five or six days I receivd a letter from sister Catharine, at <name>New Echota, <abbr expan="Georgia">Geoa.</abbr></name>, Confirming the fact._ she is married to Albert S. (and not Albert B. Lenoir)</p><p>I saw an account of the Exhibition, in the "Knoxville Register"; but I have not a word from any of the family (at home) since I left there.</p><p>Your letter gave me the first information of the death of my little niece.</p><p>What will be done with those two boys in <name>Mississippi</name> will not <name>Judge Mitchell</name> give them up to Charles or Father?  In so difficult a time as the present, I should think that the Judge would have enough to do, to take care of his own family _ especially in Mississippi _ Besides it is so unhealthy there, that it is very doubtful whether either of them could be raised to maturity__ Has Charles written to the Judge on the subject? __ They ought to leave Mississippi before fall; otherwise they will be sick</p><pb n="[3]"/><p>When I saw you last, I thought I could give you a situation here worth 60 or 90 dollars per month_ but we have reduced the number of clerks from 6 down to 2__ The reason of this reduction is, we have adopted the plan of putting the work out, in jobs, to contractors; and consequently have accounts with a few contractors only, whereas, we formerly had accounts with all individual <orig reg="laborers">labourers</orig>.</p><p>I hope you have abandoned all idea of entering into a partnership business in Talladega_ They go upon the credit system there, &amp; half the debts will <unclear>never</unclear> be collected._ The prices of goods will soon be far below their present rates_ And the individual who is in debt will find it difficult to make payments._ (I regret to learn that Charles is in debt, and holds the mortgaged property in his own hands)_ he ought to have let the mill plan go for something._ Charles says he expects to work all his life; but it is certainly imprudent in him to work when exposure is almost certain death.</p><p>I think it quite probably that there will not be a general resumption of specie payments, <unclear>sooner</unclear> than from 3 to 5 years- perhaps it will be even longer; and if so there will be a vast difference between Bank notes &amp; specie.</p><p>I arrived here on the 26th of March; 11 days over my appointed time; it was not however of much consequence Since my arrival, I have been here alone_ <name><abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Ogden</name> went to the eastern part of this state to let out contracts &amp;c,_ I have remained in charge of every thing in this quarter__ Ogden will not probably return to this place for two months.__ I have some slight hopes that I may be able to go to <name><abbr expan="Tennessee">Tenn.</abbr></name> next winter</p><p>Remember me to Charles, Caroline, and Margaret Elizabeth; and for yourself accept this hasty assurance of the love &amp; esteem of</p><closer><salute>your brother</salute><signed><name><abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> L.
