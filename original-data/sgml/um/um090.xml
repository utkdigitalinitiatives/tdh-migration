Being Friday evening I think it perhaps the best opportunity that I shall have for answering it, for as I have before informed you I am <emph>extremely busy</emph>, and am compelled from this circumstance to  leave unwritten many letters to my relations, which I feel disposed to write.  Do not infer from this, that I have not time to read them, I assure you I can always find a leisure moment. I am afraid from my oft-repeated complaints about time, you are of this opinion, &amp; therefore I have the misfortune of receiving so very few letters from you.</p><p>The Examination will commence on the last Wednesday in June.  will continue until Friday night, I believe it is generally dreaded by the girls, for <name type="person">Mr. Smith</name> tells us it will be more thorough than any he has ever yet had.  I expect there will be a great many persons here, for you are aware, that is the time that the girls return home.  Indeed I can scarcely contain myself when I think of returning <pb n="[2]"/> and of seeing you and my dear Sister in Columbia.  I am really <emph>very</emph> impatient for that time to arrive.  You wish to know if I have <emph>grown</emph> any, I have the happiness of telling you, that I have not grown the <emph>least particle</emph>, to give you my own opinion, I think, I have rather decreased in size, though Cousin <name type="person">Ellen</name> will not agree to it. I was very much pleased that you have purchased me so handsome a dress. If it is equally as convenient I should rather that you would send it with my riding dress <emph>unmade</emph>. Cousin <abbr expan="Ellen">E.</abbr> thinks the <emph>fashions</emph> are newer <emph>here</emph>. You might send them in a box by mail.  We have a very good <unclear>Mantanmaker</unclear> here, But you of course know best, in which manner to act.</p><p>I was delighted to see, yesterday, a very old friend of yours he informs me that he lived several years in the same town with you, &amp; that he corresponded with you longer, after you left school&mdash; I believe he said&mdash; than any other of his friends.  <name type="person">Mr. Trotter</name>, he inquired very particularly about you, and when I told &caret; <add place="supralinear">him</add> that you would be in Columbia at the Examination, said he would also try to make it convenient to do the same He brought his daughter up to school with, who boards at <name type="person">Mrs Wormelys</name>. I am very much pleased with her.</p><p>As you wish me to take your advice and study hard you certainly excuse my short letter.  Do write me often and tell me about the dear children.  Kiss them all for me. Give my love to my relations.</p><closer><salute>affectionately,</salute><signed><emph><name type="person"><abbr expan="Mary Jane">M.</abbr> Chester</name></emph></signed>  </closer></div1><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[3]"/>  <opener><salute>My dear Sister,</salute></opener><p>I cannot send this letter to Father, with a whole blank side, So, although you write to me so <emph>very</emph> seldom, I shall return "good for evil," and address you a few lines, remember, you will now be in debt to me for two letters, which I am very anxious to receive.</p><p>I was much distressed to hear from Papa's letter of the death of <name type="person">W.

Oh! Sister, in four weeks from this time, How <emph>very</emph> happy do I expect to be.  I wish you to write me the day that  you expect to arrive, and whether you intend <orig reg="coming">comming</orig> in the <orig reg="Carriage">Carrige</orig> or Stage.

She told me to tell <name type="person">Aunt Frances</name>  for her, that nothing would afford her more pleasure, than to see her, &amp; that she wishes very much that she would pay her a visit&mdash;  I like her, for she appears so very friendly.  I wonder if <name type="person">Aunt <abbr expan="Patsy">P.</abbr></name> intends permitting me to return home without writing me, <emph>even one</emph> letter. I am really distressed.  My Composition for the Examination, I must being to think about it.  A very excellent one is expected from me.
