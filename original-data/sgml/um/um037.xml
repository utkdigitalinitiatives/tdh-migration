Is is needless to add the recitals of home were perused with interest.

You perceive that I have followed your example in my selection of <unclear><orig reg="lecture">lecter</orig></unclear> <del type="overstrike">pa</del> paper, not that I have so much to write but for another reason that will manifest itself in the sequel, For, for the life of me I dont know what to write that would interest or amuse you. Shall I give you a history of my present condition, this you know, I am at Lagrange acting in the capacity of a student, with eight different studies to engage my attention weekly, besides numerous other subjects that are not less burdensome, hence it cannot be expected that all will receive their due <orig reg="share">shair</orig> of attention, but I trust that I may be enabled so to dispose of them, at that critical time with the senior on which his destiny hangs, and &caret; <add place="supralinear">which</add> will soon be wafted to our presence <del type="overstrike">by</del> <add place="supralinear">on</add> time's rapid moving streams, as to reflect no discredit to myself of friends &amp; kindred.
