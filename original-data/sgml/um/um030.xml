I <del type="overstrike">had</del> began to think that you did not intend writing at all to me for it was so long a time before you did write&mdash; but I can forgive you for that, for when it did come it contained so much good advice to me, that I read it and all <del type="overstrike">of</del> the rest of my letters over eve&caret;<add place="supralinear">r</add> y night. (for I have not time to read them in the day time.) Dear Mam &caret; <add place="supralinear">m</add> a you requested me to read my Bible; I do read it every morning of my life. I hope that you will forgive me for not writing home last week: but I thought as I had written two letters home week before last that you would not be uneasy. I just got time last week to answer cousin Rachel's letter. Please tell <name type="person">Eliza Bigelow</name>, and <name type="person">Frank Patterson</name> to write to me, not to wait for me to write to them for I have hardly time to write to you. Mam &caret; <add place="supralinear">m</add> a although you wrote me that Aunt Narcissa's sickness was not serious, I cannot help from feeling uneasy. Tell her that I shall feel uneasy until I receive a letter from her I want her to fill the three pages. Tell Uncle <pb n="[3]"/> and cousin Will they do not know how much a letter from them would gratify me. I am almost tired of asking Aunt P, cousin Jane, and cousin Martha Ann to write me. I cannot let brother John, and sister, off with one letter, they must write to me again. I am expecting Papa up to see me every day. Mam &caret; <add place="supralinear">m</add> a Please send me up some hazel nuts by Papa if he can bring them with <del type="overstrike">conenience</del><add place="supralinear">convenience</add>. I expect that you will think it a very strange request, but I have not had any thing good since I &caret;<add place="supralinear">have</add> been here. You wanted to know what I was studying and how I stood in my classes. It's of <orig reg="no">now</orig> use for me to write you as I expect Father has received my record by this time. We had a dreadful hail storm last evening&mdash;&caret;<add place="supralinear">Some of</add> the hail was nearly as large as a hen eggs, four or five pane's of glass was broken at the Institute. Sixteen panes were broken out of Aunt Walkers house, there was a great deal of lightning with it. We were all very much frightened I can assure you. I was thinking about you all at home all of the time. </p><p>How many teeth has brother Sam got now. I expect that he can walk and talk I dont want him to forget me. learn <del type="overstrike">him</del> <add place="supralinear">teach</add> how to call my name. Do not let any of the children  forget me. Has <name type="person">Mary Ormand</name> forgotten me. I have been away from home for so long a time O! it seems to me that it has been a year. If I could receive a letter <orig reg="more often">oftener</orig> I could pass my time more pleasantly. Dear Mam &caret; <add place="supralinear">m</add> a Give my love to my Papa &amp; all of my Brothers and my sister, and to all of my Aunts and cousins and Uncles <pb n="[4]"/> and kiss Brother Sam, King, Will, and Mary Ormand, and all my little cousins, and accept the love of</p><closer><salute>your affectionate Daughter</salute><signed><name type="person">Mary Jane Chester</name></signed><address><addrLine><name>Mrs Elizabeth Chester</name></addrLine></address></closer><closer><add place="bottom of letter"><p><abbr expan="Post Script">P.
