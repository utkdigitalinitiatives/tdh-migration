I wish that you would write to <name type="person">Mr. Smith</name> upon the subject, but not mention that I have said any thing to you about it.

I was truly pleased to hear that he was enough of a Man to do business.  Now that the "ice is broken", I hope he will write me often.  I was surprised to hear that <name type="person">Rachel Trigg</name>  had not received a letter from me, for immediately after the reception of her's, I answered it but sent it to the Post Office by a little boy, &amp; I suppose it must have been misplaced in some way, the next leisure moment that I have I shall write her again.</p><p>I have a request to make,  The first opportunity that offers itself, I wish you to send my <emph>Riding dress</emph> &mdash; You will find it in Sister's Wardrobe <orig reg="drawer">draw</orig>; I intend making it myself &mdash; It would astonish you to see how well I sew I make all my dresses, &mdash; but it is not proper to praise myself.
