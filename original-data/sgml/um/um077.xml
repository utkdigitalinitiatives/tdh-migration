I was so much delighted to receive your very affectionate letter, and also my dear Father's.  You do not know how much distressed I was to hear that he had so severe an attack.  Mama you know when you are at so great a distance as I am from the only Persons on earth you love, that when you hear that they are Sick, you generally imagine that they are worse than they in reality are.  I am precisely that way, now I have imagined that is still very Sick although your letter assured me that he was nearly well.  I do not <orig reg="dibelieve">disbeleive</orig> your word, nor would I do it for the whole world, but I am <orig reg="afraid">affraid</orig> that he has had a relapse since then.</p><p>You desired me to tell you the Uniform of the Institute at the Examination: We are not permitted to wear any thing but white, no Embroidery, no <orig reg="colored">coloured</orig> Ribbon but blue, no Jewelry excepting a <emph>Plain</emph> Breast Pin, and if we break any of these rules, <name type="person">Mr or Mrs Smith</name> will say to the Audience that such things were positively forbidden to be worn and she will then point out the young lady who has broken them.  I showed Mrs Smith <pb n="[2]"/> the part of your letter that you requested me to show her; She says that the white dress that I am having made now with the addition of the two that I brought with me will be a sufficient number for the Examination and Concert, I expect that I shall play the Russian Dance with Variations.  I think that it is a very pretty <orig reg="piece">peice</orig>, and Mrs Smith thinks that I play it very well.  As my Books are waiting patiently for me to attend to them I must close my letter, I could say a great &caret; <add place="supralinear">deal</add> more but time will not permit.  Give my love to all my dear Aunts Uncles and Cousins, all my Brothers &amp; sister, and to my dear <emph>dear</emph> Papa</p><closer><salute>Your ever <abbr expan="affectionate">affectiont</abbr> Daughter</salute><signed><name type="person">Mary Jane Chester</name></signed> <address><addrLine><name type="person">Mrs Elizabeth Chester</name></addrLine></address> <add place="bottom"><abbr expan="Post Script">P.
