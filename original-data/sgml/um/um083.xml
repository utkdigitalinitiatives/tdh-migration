Indeed dear Papa you have remained so long silent, in your letters, upon that subject, that I'm uncertain, whether I must look for you or not. If you <emph>only</emph> knew how <emph>very</emph>   anxious I am to see you, I feel certain that if it were possible you would come. I am aware that your business prevented you from coming at the time appointed, but hope that you will have leisure to come before Christmas, which you must remember is very near &mdash; and then the Examination.  I can assure you <pb n="[2]"/> that it is looked forward to, with dread, by us all.  You, I expect know from experience how very trying, and <orig reg="embarrassing">embarassing</orig> it is to any one to stand a <emph>Public Examination</emph>.  We have commenced <orig reg="reviewing">reveiwing</orig> in all our studies, to day, and it is the <emph>rule</emph> in our class that we are not to go over a <orig reg="sentence">sentance</orig> without understanding precisely its meaning.  A French Tutoress arrived at the Institute the other day, She is a French lady; and we are not permitted to speak to her in any language but that. I think that we will improve more by that Means.</p><p><name type="person">Cousin Sam</name>  has made a new arrangement in his family.  his Father in law and family [<name type="person">Mr Wormely</name>]  and himself all live together, quite a large family &caret; <add place="supralinear">of us</add> I assure you.  It reminds me of last winter when there were fifteen of the Children staying at <name type="person">Aunt Butler's</name>.</p><p>Papa you said that I have not acknowledged the receipt of the $5 that you sent me <date value="0000-10-28">28th <abbr expan="October">Oct.</abbr></date>  indeed I was under the impression that I did in the letter after I received it. I had also the pleasure of receiving the $10 that you sent by Uncle Walker, for which I thank you very much, as I was in need of it then.  I bought me a very handsome <orig reg="Muslin">Mouslin</orig> with it.  it was 87 &frac12; <abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> a <abbr expan="yard">yd.</abbr> which including the trimmings took the whole of the $10 &mdash; This will <orig reg="supersede">superede</orig> the necessity of your bringing me one.  But <name type="person">Cousin Ellen</name> thinks that I need a Calico.  I must say that I think so too. I am making my dress myself with Cousin Ellen's kind assistance.  she thinks that I sew very well. I keep an account of all the articles that I get, you will I expect <pb n="[3]"/>  think me very particular, but I merely wish to show you that your daughter is not so extravagant as She has always had the character of being.</p><p>As Cousin Sam leaves home in a day or two, he handed me my School Bills to <orig reg="enclose">inclose</orig> in this letter.  he said that he is very much engaged or he would write himself.  I want see <emph>Dear</emph> little Sam, my Sister, Brothers and all my little Cousins <emph>very very</emph> much. Tell <name type="person">Aunt Narcissa</name> I hope that she will not let my letter remain long unanswered.  We have a considerable Revival of Religion here, both in the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches.  The meeting is still going on.  they have Mourners <emph>every</emph> night.
