We have no news of much interest from the Army. <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Scott</name> has arrested <name type="person"><abbr expan="Generals">Genls</abbr> Worth</name> and <name type="person">Pillow</name> for disrespect and also some junior officers have become involved in the same <unclear>snare</unclear>. It is a disgrace all around, a disgrace to <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Scott for the manner in which he made the arrests &amp; a disgrace to the officers for the matter of the arrest and I see by the Washington Correspondent of the "Picayune" that it has been decided to recall the whole of them and place either <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Taylor</name> or <name type="person">Butler</name> in command. I hope it may be so &amp; that those officers implicated may all be dismissed the Service. The people who write from <name type="place">Mexico</name> talk about peace but I do not know what new ground they have to stand on. I am <orig reg="fearful">fearfull</orig> that it will be many years before we have peace again, but still I do not despair, the Anti war speeches of such men a <name type="person">Calhoun</name> &amp; <name type="person">Crittenden</name> are extensively republished in Mexico and do an <orig reg="immensity">immencity</orig> of harm in misleading the Mexican people as to the real sentiment in this <pb n="[2]"/> country towards them. After a while when the parties have selected their candidates for President probably we may be able to have some united action in Congress that will show Mexico that we will do all we say we will.</p><p>I must refer you to the newspapers for the particulars of all that has been going on. I am happy to state that I have another Son, now five days old, he is a fine fat fellow and very much like our family.

The Judge has the <orig reg="very">verry</orig> place to suit him and I hope he will have luck to make just decisions and an upright Judge, he looks well and was in fine spirits &amp; gave me a good deal of information of what was going forward at Montgomery.</p><p><name type="person">Pope Walker</name> is arriving to be <abbr expan="United States">U.
