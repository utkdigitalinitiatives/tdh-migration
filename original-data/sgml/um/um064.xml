I think that I could not find a more pleasant than writing to my dear Mama &amp; Papa. I know that you will think that it is not right for me to write on Sunday, but I want my letter to arrive there on Christmas day. You have no idea how much pleasure it would give me to receive one on that day. This letter I know will not find Papa at home. but I have not written to him for so long a time. that I am afraid that he will not like it. I have commenced looking for Papa up to see me. I wish that he would make haste and come. I am so very impatient to see him. Mama how do you intend spending your Christmas? I know that you will all be so happy. I do wish that I was at home. If I was I should be the happiest creature living. By &caret; <add place="supralinear">the</add> next Christmas I expect I shall be at our happy home. I always <orig reg="believed">beleived</orig> that <del type="overstrike">I got all no</del> loved you, but I never knew that I loved you so well and my sister &amp; brothers. <orig reg="Oh">O</orig> how <pb n="[2]"/> much I do want to see them. I wrote a letter to Sister Yesterday Do tell her to answer it soon. If you know how happy it make me to receive letter I know that you would write often You must forgive me for being so extravagant in my wishes for letters, for I do love to receive them so much. I commenced this letter with the determination that I would not ask for any letters but I had wrote for some before I thought of myself. Excuse my short letter. Give my love to all my relations.
