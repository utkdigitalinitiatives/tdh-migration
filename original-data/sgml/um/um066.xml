He told us about it four or five weeks ago but I forgot to mention it to Papa until now, for my mind has been so much occupied with other things. Tell Papa as much as he is willing for me to subscribe please to send it in any next letter &amp; I will give it to him.</p><p>Dear Mama this day two week is the examination. <orig reg="Oh">O</orig>!
