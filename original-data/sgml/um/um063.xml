I will write to you. I know that I would not have treated you as you have treated me. but I will forgive you if you will promise to be a better correspondent hereafter. If you know how much pleasure it gave me to receive your letter, I know that you would write to me again. Mother wrote me three or four weeks ago saying that &caret; <add place="supralinear">both</add> you and brother <name type="person">John</name> intended writing that week to me, but I expect that you have forgotten me by this time. Sister please <orig reg="answer">anser</orig> this letter as soon as you receive it, it would <orig reg="relieve">releive</orig> my mind to see that you have not forgotten me. You cannot imagine &caret; <add place="supralinear">how</add> much disappointed I was to hear that <name type="person">Aunt Narcissa</name> was not <orig reg="coming">comming</orig> up to see me, but I was as much delighted to hear that Papa was coming up. I <orig reg="wonder">wondor</orig> how I shall spend my Christmas the first one that I ever spent from home. You will all be so happy at <emph>home</emph> the very name of home makes me feel happy. I never knew how much I loved you all until I left home. There is no place like home according to my <orig reg="opinion">oppinion</orig>. <abbr expan="Sister">Sis</abbr> I am <orig reg="afraid">affraid</orig> that you cannot read this printed letter for it is the first one that I ever <orig reg="tried">trid</orig> to print. You must excuse me for not writing a longer letter for I have not time to write more. <pb n="[2]"/> <orig reg="Oh">O</orig>! it is so cold here. It is a great deal colder than in Jackson. I expect that I feel the cold more sensibly than if I was at home, for there are 40 odd girls, and only two fire places. You know that is not enough for us all to get by. I am so glad that you are not here this Winter on that account. I know that you would freeze. but I do want to so you so much. I know if was at home I would never speak an unkind word to you. Give my love to Mama &amp; Papa &amp; all the children. Aunt N. Aunt P. &amp; all my Uncles &amp; Aunts &amp; Cousins.</p><closer><salute>I remain your most affectionate Sister</salute><signed><name type="person"><abbr expan="Mary Jane">M.
