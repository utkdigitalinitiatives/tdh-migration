But believe me never, &mdash; since I can remember &mdash; have I been so pushed <emph>for time</emph>, as Since the <orig reg="beginning">begining</orig> of this session.  I have had <emph>six</emph> hard studies &mdash; besides  French &mdash; And all of the Societys duties to attend to &amp; also those of the sons of Temperance.  I had the <emph>Salutatory</emph> address to deliver before society at her first meeting, and have also had to <emph>lead</emph> in all the <emph>debates</emph> Since it began; and also hold a <emph>troublesome</emph> office in the <abbr expan="Sons">S</abbr> of temperance. Thus you see <emph>Dear Mary</emph> that I have had very little time that I could call my own.  But I <emph>know I am forgiven</emph> I have heard from  <emph>home once</emph> since I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> at <name type="place">Albany</name>  by <name type="person"><emph>Joseph Boon</emph></name><figure><figDesc>hands pointing to "Joseph Boon"</figDesc></figure>  <unclear>Jes</unclear> <emph>Joseph am arrive</emph>.  They were all well at home when <del type="overstrike">I wrote</del> he left.  But the strangest thing yet remains to be told.  Father sent <name type="person">Ben</name> &amp; myself each a <emph>Watch</emph> (not a dog) a <emph><orig reg="running">runing</orig> watch</emph>, <emph>one that keeps times</emph>!!, <emph>A Silver Watch</emph>!!! I thought he was <emph>crazy</emph> when he Said he <emph>thought</emph> of doing it; But now I <emph>know</emph> he is.  What had better be done with him? I wish he would get crazy and send me some <emph>money</emph>, as I have not seen 10 <abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> since, yesterday was two weeks ago! &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;</p> <pb n="[2]"/> <p>Mary! Oh if you only knew how <emph>happy</emph> your letter made me when I read it, you would have some idea of a Brothers love.  Can you imagine any happier scene, than to see <orig reg="to">two</orig> whom God hath united by the ties which bind a Brothers &amp; Sister &mdash; placing mutual confidence in each other, and seeming to live, only that <emph>each</emph> may be a help &amp; comfort to the other? Let us both unite and form such a <emph>Scene</emph> as <emph>this</emph> I have represented.  At the present time I am earnestly considering what Profession I will choose, to which I will devote the remainder of my life.  At one time the Law with its honors &amp; profits recurs  to my mind as being the most Suitable; Again the Ministry With its responsibilities, &amp; reward <emph>hereafter</emph> forces itself upon my mind; And while weighing the "why &amp; the why fore" on both sides, another thought comes home with triple force: the thought that I should be a missionary.  There is a field here opens itself, which is extensive &amp; Grand almost beyond comprehension.  Survey it on every side! Consider that within its boundaries, six hundred millions of souls are embraced, All of whom if we must believe the scriptures, will be <emph>irrecoverably</emph> lost, if they do not embrace Christ as he is freely offered to him in the gospel. Methinks I hear the Macedonian "Cry come over and help us."  But who will go?  Every one shrinks from the labors &amp; dangers attending on being a missionary; And can point out some neighbors or friend, whose duty it is <emph>undoubtedly</emph> to go.  Thus each <orig reg="tries">trys</orig> to throw off the responsibility, upon another; And all doing this, no one will be found to go.  But shall <emph>I</emph> go?  Say. <figure><figDesc>fingers pointing to "Say"</figDesc></figure></p> <pb n="[3]"/> <p>From your description of <name type="person">Fannie Ferguson</name>, I must confess that I am &mdash; not in love &mdash; but <emph>her ardent admirer</emph>; And in truth if I was not <orig reg="sure">shure</orig> of a <emph>rebuke</emph> I would address a small <emph>note to her </emph> However tell her that whoever <emph>my sister</emph> loves, is also loved by <emph>"My Sister's" brother</emph>. And if <emph>you</emph> think <emph>she</emph> would not be mortally offended, I will make the proposition of a <emph>regular correspondence</emph>, in my next.  Tell me do you think <emph>we could do it</emph>! Would it not be romantic. two persons who have never seen each other keeping up a regular correspondence!!! But I think it will all turn out <emph>romance</emph>, And not be much <emph>reality about</emph> it! But <name type="person"><emph>Miss Mary Graham</emph></name> must not consider herself slighted  At <emph>all</emph>; for I have no doubt Ben will lay a plot for her.  In conclusion of this subject Remember me to <emph>both</emph> of them; And as you are all thrown together, <orig reg="pursuing">persuing</orig> the same studies: be kind and affectionate to one another; And you should try to find out one anothers <emph>good qualities</emph>; not <emph>faults</emph>. And above all Mary, be <orig reg="respectful">respectfull</orig> to  <emph>your teachers</emph>; And although you may not like them now, but consider them <orig reg="tyrannical">tyranical</orig> &mdash; <emph>a little</emph> &mdash;; yet remember you are now <emph>moulding</emph> your mind, for usefulness hereafter; not only in this world, but in the world to come. I have no doubt, but that, in after years, we will look back to the present time, with feelings of thankfulness to those, who are now conducting us through the crooked labyrinths of science; and will also experience feelings of regret that we have wasted so many precious hours, And let slip so many opportunities of improvement.  But above all my dear <emph>sister</emph>  let me intreat you to strictly perform your spiritual duties.  Oh is it not  blessed thing to be a <emph>christian</emph>! To think that we &caret; <add place="supralinear">have</add> not only provided for ourselves comfort &amp; peace of conscience during our short stay upon this earth; <pb n="[4]"/> but have also made provisions for passing an <emph>eternity</emph> of bliss, with God, and angels, &amp; friends to whom we bid farewell years ago.  Consider well the duties obligatory <orig reg="upon">opon</orig> you as a <emph>christian</emph>, and follower of Christ.  Those around you will watch to see how religion <emph>becomes</emph> you; And will judge the cause by you.  And it is not a soul-refreshing thought that all of our family have professed their faith in Christ; and have assurance of a better world hereafter.  Then let not one chain of the <emph>link</emph> be broken.  Let us not neglect our daily prayer; And pray especially that God would give us faith &amp; grace sufficient, and strength to resist all temptation.  Are Fanny &amp; Mary <abbr expan="Graham">G</abbr> professors of Religion?</p><p><name type="person">Ben</name>  &amp; <name type="person">Davis</name> are in my room studying a lesson, and make such a fuss I must close this letter.   </p><p>Our new President has not yet come to hand, and I <abbr expan="do not">dont</abbr> know when he will come.  I had to get excused from recitation today, in order to write to you; so you know how hard pushed I am. You can find out from Fannie <abbr expan="Ferguson">F</abbr> if she would be pleased with my suggestion; and if she will, put on the <emph>top of your next letter</emph> the following sign <lb/> Yes <figure><figDesc>fingers pointing to "Yes"</figDesc></figure>  <emph>and if not</emph> put No<figure><figDesc>fingers pointing to "No"</figDesc></figure> And on this way <name type="person">Mrs Anderson</name>  will not understand what you mean, Of Course you will not show this letter to <emph>any</emph> one.  If Fannie has the least hesitation about it let me know, and of course I will drop the subject.  You will not tell her all I said, but simply that I would like to do it.  I will try and write to you regularly, But if you do not <orig reg="receive">recieve</orig> a letter regularly attribute it, to my <emph>inability</emph> &amp; not to <emph>negligence</emph>.  Write immediately, And Believe me I Remain Your</p><closer><salute>Affectionate Brother</salute><signed><name type="person"><abbr expan="Edward">Ed</abbr> E Porter</name></signed></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
