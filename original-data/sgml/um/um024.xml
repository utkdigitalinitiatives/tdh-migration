I &caret;<del type="overstrike">se</del><add place="supralinear">received</add> your kind and affectionate <del type="overstrike">on</del> <add place="supralinear">letter</add> yesterday. It gratified me very much indeed to see that you could write such an <orig reg="intelligent">inteligent</orig> letter. I have recovered &caret;<add place="supralinear">entirely</add> from my sickness; and commenced school week before last. I am very much pleased with the Insitute indeed. I have received no <orig reg="censures">cencures</orig> yet, but it is very difficult to keep them off <del type="overstrike">of</del> my list. I am in the Second Senior Department we all have to study very hard <del type="overstroke">indeed</del>. We sit up every night until<del type="overstrike">l</del> 9, o'clock, and get up at daybreak every morning. I am taking Music lessons under a very fine teacher <del type="overstrike">indeed</del>, <name type="person">Mrs <del type="overstrike">Bolman</del>,  <add place="supralinear ">Boardman</add></name> she pays a great deal of attention to my fingering. I practice from 8 until 9 O'Clock every night. I sleep in the third <emph>S</emph>tory, <add place="supralinear">no capital</add> in the long Dormitory. Dear sister you say that I do not &caret;<add place="supralinear">write</add> to you often enough; hereafter I shall try to write <del type="overstrike">to</del> <del type="overstrike"><add place="supralinear">you</add></del> every week as I have composition to write then and I shall write a letter in its place. Sister you forgot to write me what cousin Martha Ann has named her fine son. O' I should like to see him so much. I expect Aunt P. &amp; uncle Will are very much delighted that it is a son. Tell <name type="person">Aunt Narcissa</name> that I shall write to her next week; but one letter must do for you all for we are not allowed to write but one letter a <pb n="[3]"/> week. I want to see you all so very much that I can scarcely study for thinking of home. O' why do not some of my relation write to me I think that some of them might write <del type="overstrike">to me</del> . tell them that they must not wait to receive a letter from me. You do not know how very bad I feel when all of the letters come and there is none for me. tell Aunt Narcissa I thought that her ; Aunt F. and cousin Jane were going to write to me directly I arrived here; and I have not received one line from them yet. I received a letter from cousin Rachel last Saturday; she says that they are all very well and that <name type="place">Florida</name> is very gay. Oh! <del type="overstrike">she</del> you said that I had forgot to tell the name of the little girl that sent her love to you; it was <name type="person">Ann Maria Walker</name>. I expect that Brother Sam looks very sweet with his new tooth. O' I do want to see him so much. Why dont cousin Dick write to me it is getting very late now and I go to book as cousin Will says.</p><closer><salute>I remain your affectionate Sister</salute><signed><name type="person"><abbr expan="Mary Jane">M.
