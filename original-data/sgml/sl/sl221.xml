at least, I could not be happy long without you &mdash; There is an indefinable something which enforces the thought that we are one &mdash; Then how painful to be absent, a moment from our real self &mdash; I long too, to see our little ones &mdash; I have conjured up a thousand times in my mind how Sally looks, and how much changed she will be when I see her &mdash;</p><p>I shall leave for <abbr expan="Alabama">Alaba</abbr> the very moment &mdash;
