This is as it should be.  Men should <orig reg="wait">waite</orig> till public sentiment settles down in their favor before they become candidates for the law making power.

If <name type="person"><abbr expan="Doctor">Dr</abbr> Robinson</name> will not run, <name type="person"><abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Guild</name> has as much management in conducting a canvas as any one we can start.  <name type="person"><unclear>Boddie</unclear></name> is more popular in Smith but his health forbids his running.

Had you not better have a convention before we do.</p><p>3rdly _ We ought not to nominate a candidate for Congress.
