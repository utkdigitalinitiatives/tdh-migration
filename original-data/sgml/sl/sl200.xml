I am not in mood for writing at this &caret; <add place="supralinear">time</add> as I have been pestered with surveyors and <unclear>chimicasrios?</unclear> for several days.

Give my love to all enquiring friends <abbr expan="Thomas W. Claybrooke">TWC</abbr></p><p>My Dear Relations (Continued) I have just read over your letter directed to Thomas and find by said letter you have not <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> a letter from me since the death our Uncle. I have written you three letters since the <date value="1833-04-12">12th of April</date>, at which time our Uncle departed this life. The first letter I wrote you , was in a few days after his death, giving you all the particulars relative to his sickness and his death, and in said letter, I enclosed a beautiful purse, made of beads, as &caret; <add place="supralinear">a</add> present for my nephew <name type="person">James Hart</name>, with a piece poetry attached to the purse, of which I was <pb n="[2]"/> the author. &mdash; I took a great deal of trouble &amp; pains in sending this purse. I sealed up the letter in the presence of the Postmaster in <name type="place">Nashville</name> &amp; paid the double postage. In my next letter, I enclosed a beautiful belt made of beads for S.O. This second &caret; <add place="supralinear">letter</add> was written <del type="overstrike">in</del> about ten days after the first, bearing date about <date value="1833-05-01">1st May</date>, and completing a full history and a minute detail of matters relative to my Uncles death, and as to &caret; <add place="supralinear">the</add> management of his estate. I waited with a great deal of patience and anxiety to <orig reg="receive">receve</orig> answers to these several letters, but alas in vain!&mdash; I heard you all were in usual health, a few days previous to my departure from <name type="place">Williamson County</name> on the <date value="1833-07-01">1st July</date>, through a letter <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> from <name type="person">Dr. Coates</name>, in  answer to one I had written sometime about the <date value="1833-05-15">15th of May</date>. I am truly sorry, if said letters containing the above named presents are lost, <orig reg="particularly">particuly</orig> too, as they contained other valuable &amp; important information. I hope you have <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> them before this time and they are <abbr expan="answered">answd</abbr> ; if otherwise, I shall get the <abbr expan="Post Master">PM</abbr> General to enquire into the cause of their not going to <name type="place">Pottiesville</name>. It is possible they may have been broken &amp; destroyed by the servant you send to the office. You can easily ascertain by reference to the P. M. at Pottiesville. I have been very sick for the last six weeks with the <orig reg="measles">meazles</orig>, until within in a few day past</p><p>When I left Nashville, I was so weak, it was with the greatest difficulty I &caret; <add place="supralinear">could</add> ride however the nature of my business required my presence in this section of the State, and I mended every day until I have entirely regained my strength &amp; health. There has been more sickness in <name type="place"> Williamson &amp; Davidson Counties</name>, and more deaths within <pb n="[3]"/> the last ten months, than there has been in the whole ten years previous. There were as many as 60 cases of Cholera in a day, in the little town  Nashville. Many of its most conspicuous, enterprising and valuable citizens have died with this malady. Eighty, out of 85 convicted in the Penitentiary had the Cholera. My friends were very uneasy for fear I would take it , as it is considered contagious in this country. I was compelled to be in Nashville when it was raging there. I found Thomas &amp; all the negroes well. Crops are good here as well as &caret; <add place="supralinear">in</add> middle Tennessee. We rather <orig reg="over cropped">overcroped</orig> ourselves owing to this circumstance <abbr expan="id est">i.e.</abbr> I expected we should get more hands, when I pitched the crop. We have not got the P. Office established as yet, on account of my having so much business on hand which was obliged to be attended to, and of course, I could not correspond with P. M. G. upon the subject. I shall write to him in the course of a few days. I have written upwards of one hundred letters since my Executorship commenced, and these too, were generally written after sunset. I recd a few days since, a very friendly &caret; <add place="supralinear">letter</add> from the President of the United States. I shall answer it, so soon as I return to Nashville. I shall leave here tomorrow on my journey through 8 counties to pay the taxes on lands&caret; <add place="supralinear">that were</add> belonging to <name type="person">Judge Overton</name>, &caret; <add place="supralinear">and</add> I will then return by here on <add place="supralinear">my</add> way to Nashville and from there to my S <add place="supralinear">c</add> hool house, to resume an occupation, from which in long, I hope to retire, and to repair an already shattered constitution, although I have never had any sickness to prevent me from attending to my avocation since I crossed the <name type="place"><orig reg="Allegheny">Alleghany </orig>Mountains</name>, notwithstanding I cannot <pb n="[4]"/> undergo half the fatigue, that I could two years ago. You must write me a letter directly this is <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> informing me whether my letters have ever been <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> &mdash; Give my respects to all acquaintances, for friends, (except my relations) I have but few. We are all well, tell Father, and I think are doing well. Give my love to him and ask him to save for &caret; <add place="supralinear">me</add> the colt called <gap reason="blank"/> , as I hope next spring to visit <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr>  to see all once &caret; <add place="supralinear">more</add> provided I decline teaching this fall.</p><p><abbr expan="Nota Bene">NB</abbr> It is past 12 Oclock in the night.
