Sir</salute></opener><p>There is, at this time, strong hope of the completion of the <name>Hiwassee Rail Road</name>, and nearly, if not quite all <abbr expan="East Tennessee">E. Ten</abbr>. is rejoiced at the prospect, as the only means of redeeming this portion of the State__ And while the people are trying to devise the best possible mode of prosecuting the work, the company are likewise endeavoring to adopt the best means to disenthral the Road, and place it in the hands of solvent and additional stockholders of <name>East Tennessee</name>.  There is some anxiety on the part of the others, that the whole matter should be <unclear>thrown</unclear> , or let fall into the hands of Southern men, who, it is believed would readily embrace it.  The whole community, therefore, are content whether it is made by citizens or a company in the south, as to the benefits that will result to E. Ten. But there are fears that if the management of the road is retained in the hands of the same individuals, and at the same place, to wit <name>Athens</name>, as heretofore, there will remain a suspicion in the community, or a want of confidence rather, in the success of the measure.  Therefore, it is thought that a great portion of this stumbling block can be removed by your <unclear>action</unclear> ; and after looking into the premises, you will be able to act deliberately, and that action will not prejudice the company, or any individuals of it.  That is, to appoint men, directors, on the part of the State, at Knoxville and vicinity, and make Knoxville the head quarters or place of the company's operations.  This may seem, <pb n="[2]"/> at first view, like seeking business, but the idea has, in part, been suggested by one or two of the leading men at Athens.</p><p>If the subject strikes your mind in this light, and <add>if</add> you will write me, I will, by the assistance of several others, suggest a number of gentlemen, <unclear>out</unclear> of whom you can get an energetic and reliable board, so far as the State is concerned.</p><p>There is no work that could be named that would do E. Ten. so much good as the completion of this road, and if it falls back now we are hid in the sand for at least an age.</p><p>Already our citizens, below here, are exchanging cornmeal for Liverpool salt, bushel for bushel, which of itself will be a saving to us of thousands of dollars per annum.</p><closer>Your friend <signed>Isaac Lewis</signed> <add>His Excellency <name><abbr expan="Aaron Venable">A.V</abbr>.
