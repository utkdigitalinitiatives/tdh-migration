The Union Bank of Tennessee has heretofore acted as the agent of the state in making the payment of the semi-annual interest on these Bonds, and has uniformly made provision for its payment at the Girard Bank in Philadelphia, as it fell due <pb n="[2]"/> that being the plan stipulated for the payment of the interest, when the Bonds were negotiated. In regard to the interest due on the 1st of July last ($6.250)__ the President of the Union Bank informs me, that as the agent of the State, that Bank in the latter part of June, deposited the amount due on the first of July in the Girard Bank in Philadelphia to the credit of the "Commissioner of Indian affairs" and that the Secretary of the Treasury was advised of the fact by the Union Bank, under date of the 2nd of July last. The President of the Union Bank insists, that the Bank has discharged her duty, by making the deposit in species at the Girard Bank, to meet the payment which fell due on the 1st of July, and that the loss or inconvenience which may be suffered, by the subsequent suspension of specie payments by the Girard Bank, in October following, should be borne by the holder of the Bonds, who failed to call on the day for the amount due. Without undertaking to <del type="overstrike">decide</del> give an opinion as to the correctness of the <unclear>insuing presented</unclear> by the President of the Union Bank, I am informed by him, that he has addressed you on the subject, and <add>that he</add> has also addressed the agent of the Bonds at Philadelphia <add>with a view to make a proper arrangement <unclear> [unclear]</unclear></add> and I have <unclear>every reason</unclear> to believe, from what what he informs me, that the payment will be made at an early <add>day</add>_ <del type="overstrike">Should the arrangement made by the Union Bank close alluded to fail to accomplish the object I will together</del> If it should not be paid by the Bank upon being infor <pb n="[3]"/> formed of the fact by you I will take such measures as my<del type="overstrike"><unclear>and  that the credit of the state shall by war</unclear></del> given to be proper with a view to ensure its payment and <del type="overstrike"><unclear>possitretity suffer en that such am using are</unclear></del> preserve the credit of the state The interest on there <del type="overstrike"><unclear>taken as shall mean the payment of the money</unclear></del> Bonds, which shall hereafter fall due, will be <unclear>presently</unclear> <del type="overstrike">at are early day.</del> paid in specie.</p>
