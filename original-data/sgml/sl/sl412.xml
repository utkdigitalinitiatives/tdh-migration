It is whispered about and <del>seem</del> the opinion Seems to be gaining ground that our clerk of the County Court will resign his office,  <add>at  the next year</add> and two <orig reg="candidates">canidates</orig> are already in nomination.  I would here remark that I think the idea is premature and as far as my enquiries go the present clerk will be Sustained in office at least the peace of Smith County would require it.  I would further remark that I would no means insinuate any thing as respectful to the present Clerk on the contrary I would like to see him <del>Sustained</del> Remain as he is  But should it prove otherwise and a new clerk is to be elected, you with the rest of <add>your</add> <del>the</del> fellow Justices will be called upon in your official capacity to make a Suitable choice to fill his place.  In doing this Your Judgement will be exercised to <del>make a Suitable choice Judge of the</del> <add>deliver on the</add> qualifications of those who may be candidates.  Among those who will offer their <orig reg="pretensions">pretentions</orig> for that High and respectable office I hold myself as one.  I have been in office <gap reason="Document is stained"/> I have had <unclear>transactions</unclear> with most of the people of this county and I feel no small pride in saying that they have on all <orig reg="occasions">ocations</orig> given me the most flattering <pb n="[2]"/> proofs of their confidence.  My <orig reg="acquaintance">acquantance</orig> with <add>you</add> as I trust is of such a character as to enable you to <del>weigh</del> <add>judge</add> of my qualifications and give them that  <orig reg="Support">Suport</orig> which you may think them enabled to.  I would here remark that I belong to no party and have kept myself aloof from all <orig reg="connections">conections</orig> with the <orig reg="politics">politicks</orig> of the day. <del>and as</del> I hope your are not one of those who will form your <orig reg="opinion">oppinion</orig> or provide your <orig reg="Support">Suport</orig> until you know who all are candidates With regard to necessary qualities to make <add>a clerk</add> they consist of so many that room cannot be found here <add>so enumerate them</add> <orig reg="Suffice">Sufice</orig> it to Say that I intend calling upon you when and <orig reg="where">wher</orig> we will talk of matters and things in general I would like to see you here on <add>the evening of tuesday</add> the 21 it being our regular meeting, and I know your friends generally would like to see you.</p><p>If in the course of your acquantance you should meet with an <orig reg="opportunity">oppurtunity</orig> of conversing with some of the Justices of the peace upon the Subject (and I do think it necessary) you will be so kind as to mention me as a candidate. I understand  the other candidates  spoken of are <name>Don C  Dixon</name> and <name>David Greer</name> but your own <del>good</del> prudence must tell <abbr expan="you">y </abbr> that there will be many more.  <del>I put</del> <gap reason="Hole in document"/> <pb n="[3]"/> I wish <orig reg="you">yo</orig> to write to me on the receipt of this letter either by the first oppurtunity or by mail and would like to hear your views on the subject and also the opinions of your friends. <add>as it is out of my power to leave home</add> Give my respects to your friends and I hope you will pardon the trouble this may give <add>you</add> I wish you to consider this as a confidential consideration as it is not known how matters will turn out until time shall give evidence</p> <closer>with Sincere respect I am yours &amp;c <signed><name><abbr expan="Adam">A</abbr> Fergusson</name></signed> <add>Atttest<lb/> <name>Jona Picket</name>t <lb/> Jona Pickett</add> <pb n="[4]"/> <add>James</add> <address><addrLine><name>Joshua M Coffee </name><abbr expan="Esquire">Esqr</abbr><name> Alexandria</name> <name>Smith County</name> <name>Tennessee</name></addrLine></address><add>Copy</add></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
