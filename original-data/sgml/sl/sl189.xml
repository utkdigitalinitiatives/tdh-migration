It is from a woman named Ada to L. E., who is probably a man. Ada writes about a terrible event in her town where a woman named Rosalie died from a broken heart after being betrayed by a womanizer. Ada is very upset because she feels that it is a common occurrence, and admonishes L. E. never to do anything of the sort. She also mysteriously writes that she may have to stop corresponding with him.</note><note type="collection">Orr Collection IV-J-2</note><note type="box">2</note><note type="folder">2</note><note type="document">sl189</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Life change events</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Nashville</name> <date value="1846-02-27"><abbr expan="February">Feby</abbr> 27th 1846</date></addrLine></address><salute>To <name type="person">L E</name></salute></opener><p>The world is not yet destroyed by Millerism nor by the annexation of Texas&mdash; what the  <name type="place">Oregon</name> question will bring to pass is in the future. Infidelity in matters of the &caret; <add place="supralinear">heart</add> by man &mdash; has destroyed its victims by thousands &mdash; and yet what smooth names are given to it &mdash; such as a gay "Lothario" &mdash; or gay <orig reg="deceiver">deciever</orig> &mdash; but in my humble opinion, should be <orig reg="designated">descinated</orig> assassination &mdash; Yes; tis cruel butchery to break the heart strings of lovely innocence by degrees &mdash; And yet it is so romantic &mdash; there is something so delightfully charming and exciting   to have a flirtation with a beauty or a belle &mdash; something so heroic and magnanimous to play the hypocrite to win the affections of  innocence and unsuspecting youth &mdash; it is really an achievement to boast of a feather in the cap &mdash; exhibiting tact and talent of no ordinary character worthy a "Napoleon" &mdash; to which is attached merit of a  superior order&mdash; and has so much of nobleness, and honor about it &mdash; as to be made a proper subject for street gossip &mdash; Such is a part of your &caret; <add place="supralinear">boasted</add> superiority over woman &mdash; Aye &mdash; woman &mdash; the very best and most lovely part of creation &mdash; How often is it the case that the path <sic corr="of">of of</sic> sweet, confiding woman is set with thorns &mdash; when it should have been strewn with flowers &mdash; I am neither drawing or painting a fancy sketch &mdash; examples are abundant of the reckless duplicity of man towards woman &mdash; One is yet fresh in my memory &mdash; whose history is but the emblem of thousands &mdash; and such deeds of darkness go unpunished &mdash; <name type="person">Rosalie</name> &mdash; was gentle &mdash; kind and with a disposition altogether charming &mdash; it was impossible to know her, without perceiving her most excellent traits of character which had <pb n="[2]"/> Cemented and bound to her many friends &mdash; and her sad fate will often call forth the unbidden tear sacred to her memory &mdash; Charles &mdash; <unclear>B</unclear> &mdash; had just entered upon his profession &mdash; which was that of the law &mdash; when accident made him acquainted with Rosalie &mdash; He came not as a warrior with glittering sword or spear &mdash; nor as a conqueror with the breath of victory upon his brow &mdash; But he came with a smile in his eye and the bloom of youth upon his cheek &mdash; with melting words of love upon his lips &mdash; His eye looked an unerring index, that his soul was pure &mdash; and his bearing &mdash; that of a gentleman &mdash; such were the weapons with which he took captive her too susceptible heart &mdash; His vows, were the eloquent vows of  love until he obtained an ackowledgement from <abbr expan="Rosalie">R</abbr> &mdash; of her love &mdash; He suddenly grew more cold and indifferent as though he achieved all he desired &mdash; And his <orig reg="solemn">solem</orig> oaths were soon forgot &mdash; He left her struggling heart wounded and stricken and crushed by the very power, which she looked to as a ministering angel to &caret; <add place="supralinear">bring</add> her peace &mdash; xxxxxx</p><p>Her young life ebbed away as she saw each hope prove false and the silken cords which entwined around her heart were rudely severed &mdash; She <unclear>was meret?</unclear> not but as &caret; <add place="supralinear">a</add> fair flower beneath the blast &mdash; she faded fast With a broken heart &mdash; she fell a victim to the infidelity of man &mdash; and her gentle spirit winged its way from earth to heaven &mdash; where sorrow will never wring &caret; <add place="supralinear">it</add> more &mdash; Her mortal remains lie <orig reg="buried">burried</orig> in the church yard &mdash; over which is erected a marble &mdash; to tell the passenger and stranger this is now the dwelling place of what was once lovely and innocent the mortal remains of Rosalie &mdash; She was cut off in the spring time  of life &mdash; a lovely flower, <orig reg="nipped">niped</orig> by treachery &mdash; to gratify a false ambition and as infamous as false &mdash; Aye tis cruel to sport with the  <pb n="[3]"/> feelings of the heart &mdash; particularly where the &caret;<add place="supralinear">heart</add> is young and tender &mdash; "It may be sport for you &mdash; but death to us " &mdash;</p><p>And this is woman's history &mdash; her hearts history <lb/> The tale of one who loved, as only woman loves &mdash; <lb/> In sickness and in sorrow &mdash; and in death &mdash;</p><p>For the dignity and honor of human nature &mdash; I hope you will never decieve innocence &mdash; nor betray the Confiding heart of woman &mdash; There is nothing magnanimous noble or generous in such an act &mdash; and betrays in him who is guilty of &caret; <add place="supralinear">it</add> either weakness &mdash; or a black heart as hard as it is black &mdash;</p><p>You have recently been saying to your friend <name type="person">Mr "Remmington"</name> that "Ada had forgotten you" &mdash; Not so &mdash; the finger of time may write furrows upon my cheeks &mdash; but can never obliterate from the heart, the memory of other days &mdash; Womans heart is sometimes compared to wax , or being easy to make an impression upon &mdash; yet when made &mdash; it is as lasting, as if written by a point of steel, upon a plate of brass &mdash; I did not see you but once I believe &mdash; during your last visit &mdash; as most of my time was spent with some friends in the country &mdash; and we had come in &mdash; to attend the "fair" &mdash; when I took occasion to drop you through the letter box &mdash; of the fair &mdash; a short epistle &mdash; I never learned whether or not you received it &mdash; There will be a day &mdash; (and perhaps not far distant) when this <orig reg="addressing">addresing</orig> you will cease &mdash; from a cause &mdash; it would be imprudent in me to mention &mdash; but will explain its self in due course of time &mdash; "He that hath an ear let him hear" &mdash;</p><p> I have heard something about your Mr. Remmington &mdash; and I have some curiosity to see him &mdash; I am told he has a great regard for the ladies &mdash; if so &mdash; it bespeaks him a man &mdash; aye a jewel of the "first water" &mdash; <pb n="[4]"/> I am writing this by candle-light &mdash; with the Thermometer twenty degrees below freezing point &mdash; so you must excuse my cold expressions all &mdash; but the infidelity of your sex &mdash; which should be entered upon the statute books, as murder in the first degree &mdash; and  punishable accordingly &mdash; for if there is any difference in crime it is &caret; <add place="supralinear">in</add> favor of the being who stabs or shoots his fellow being; for then, the pain and suffering is soon over &mdash; but in the other case &mdash; the death is gradual &mdash; with a thousand hopes crushed, as soon almost as formed</p><p>But I have written enough, in my feeble way, on this subject for the present &mdash; and as it is now ten oclock  P. M.  will close by wishing you health &mdash; happiness and a long life</p><closer><signed>Ada</signed></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
