Anderson, who worked in the office of  the Revivalist, a publication of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.  Anderson's letter is in reply to the reception of Ewing's most recent article for publication and also Ewing's expression of disapproval of a recently-published article by a man named Amicus.  Anderson explains that Amicus had deceived him into thinking the article was approved by James Smith, Ewing's nephew and the Revivalist's editor.  </note><note type="collection">Finis Ewing Papers</note><note type="box">I-A-4</note><note type="folder">2</note><note type="document">sl346</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Religious study and teaching</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine>Revivalist Office</addrLine><addrLine><name>Nashville</name> <date><abbr expan="January">Jan</abbr> 17 <add>1834</add></date></addrLine></address><salute>Father Ewing,</salute></opener><p><add>p.s. Should you again notice <unclear>Amicus</unclear>, say nothing of the information herein given, still <unclear>sprat</unclear> of him as the unknown</add> Your communication has just been handed to the printer.  As a whole I am <orig reg="hugely">hugly</orig> pleased with it.  <unclear>Amicus</unclear> was as unacceptable in this country as in yours.  You may ask why was it published?

A few days after brother <name>Smith</name> left for <name><abbr expan="Pennsylvania">pa</abbr></name> , <unclear>Amicus</unclear> came into <pb n="[2]"/> the Office, read me his communication and intimated to me that he and Smith had had a conversation on the subject, and that it was with the knowledge and approbation of brother Smith that he wrote upon that subject.  I disliked the production, and had I exercised my own judgement I should not have published; but as I was acting as agent for brother Smith and as I supposed he had approved the authors intention to write, being thus delicately situated, I determined to let it go for <orig reg="what">waht</orig> it was worth without <orig reg="note">not</orig> or comment.  Had I approved of the thing I would have expunged the <orig reg="exceptionable">acceptionable</orig> parts, but I determined not to lay hands upon it.</p><p>Brother Smith has not yet returned but in a letter he recently inquired of me who <unclear>Amicus</unclear> was, and expressed his disapprobation of the piece.</p><p>So much for <unclear>Amicus</unclear>.</p><p>I am well pleased with your friendly <orig reg="advice">advise</orig>, and hope it will be profitable.  <pb n="[3]"/>  But did you know the multiplicity of business devolving upon me in brother Smiths absence.  you would be prepared to <orig reg="apologize">appologize</orig> for an occasional typographical error, However I know the Revivalist to be a clear of errors as an paper in West.</p><p>Your remark in the communication I have taken the liberty to erase for the following reasons: First, it could not profit any person but the Editor _  and he will <orig reg="receive">receve</orig> all the <unclear>benefits</unclear><gap/> without publishing that could be realized by its <orig reg="admission">admition</orig>. Second, An Old Observer so stamps himself upon his communication that all who know the <del type="erasure">and</del> man recognize him.  And I was unwilling that censure should go forth from so high a sources without the privilege of making an offset by way of exploration, and  this would have been throwing more stuff into the Revivalist when I am sorry to say too much is already <orig reg="found">fond</orig>, <pb n="[4]"/> I hope the course <orig reg="pursued">persued</orig> with this <orig reg="explanation">expanation</orig> will meet your approbation.  The <unclear>Garrons</unclear> thought will not be lost.  It is still floating upon the Ocean of mind and will yet find a resting place. <add><address><addrLine>Rev <name>Finis Ewing</name></addrLine><addrLine><name>Lexington</name></addrLine><addrLine><name><abbr expan="Missouri">Mo</abbr></name>,</addrLine></address> <add>T C Anderson <lb/> Jan 17- 1834</add></add></p><p>Brother Smith will be at home in a few days- Give us another sermon soon- Your communications are always  a treat- </p><closer><salute>With feelings of filial affection I subscribe myself a son in the Ministry of Christ</salute><signed><name> T.
