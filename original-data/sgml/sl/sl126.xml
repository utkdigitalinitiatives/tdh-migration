Since I last wrote to you I have collected very little that is new or would be interesting to you. If  I could express my ideas as prettily as I would wish I would try to comply with your request &mdash; after reading a work then is many parts of it may strike me as sublime or beautiful yet I lack words to express my ideas as they ought to be &mdash; this prevents me from making an effort. I do not for one moment question the sincerity of your motives &amp; would cheerfully do any thing to gratify you <del type="overstrike">that</del> if I felt competent to do &caret; <add place="linear">so</add> even to commence the profession of law though arduous as it is &mdash; <pb n="[2]"/> I am sure if I was able or felt that I could accomplish any profession I would have been willing to have attempted it, you know that my thirst for more than a mere pittance would be a very great inducement aside from any other <del type="overstrike">if nothing</del> else It is true I ought to be very thankful that I have health &amp; have been spared thus far without mourning over my condition;  <orig reg="there">their</orig> are many whose situation is much more deplorable than mine. from this thought &amp; the mercies bestowed upon us every day that we live;  we ought to be contented in whatever situation we may be placed. I was some what surprised to hear that the folks of <name type="place">Montgomery</name> had me married. I did not think that you would be troubled at all for I am sure if   <del type="overstrike">I</del> such had have been the case you certainly would have Known something about it. I would <orig reg="never">neve</orig> &caret; <add place="supralinear">have</add> concealed this from you if <orig reg="there">ther</orig> had been any thing of it &mdash;: as you remarked if my purse was large enough I dont Know but what their would be some danger, but the prospect of an enlargement of my purse is so gloomy that I dont think you need be alarmed yet a while. The only thing I regret is that I have all necessary preparations yet to make. It has been reported that the Cholera is in <name type="place">Nashville</name> &amp; <pb n="[3]"/> has been for sometime it is nearer than that at least reported to be in <name type="place"><orig reg="Murfreesboro">Murfreesborough</orig></name> which is 25 miles from this. The panic has in a great degree worn off the citizens of this place: I have me doubt that if the cholera would make its <orig reg="appearance">apperance</orig> here that they would all flee to the country for refuge &mdash; &amp; desert the place entirely as they done in <emph>38</emph> or when it visited them before</p><p>A few nights since we <del type="overstrike">had</del> were aroused from sleep by the cry of fire a <orig reg="farm">fram</orig> house <del type="overstrike">was</del> used for a grocery which stood near the business side of the <orig reg="square">squre</orig> had taken fire from negligence: the night was storm<gap reason="hole in document"/> the wind blew very hard and all the <gap reason="hole in document"/>orce on our side took fire. I never saw such a dismal sight. Their was no person that saw the fire but <add place="supralinear">what</add> give up every thing as lost, but by the exertions of the young men principally, the buildings were all saved except the grocery &mdash; that we dont miss much. The damage from fire was about twelve hundred dollars. a great <del type="overstrike">deal</del> many goods was stolen &amp; abused very much by <orig reg="moving">moveing</orig> them out of the stores &mdash; No person was injured though their was some very narrow escapes from powder &mdash; they were so much excited that several Kegs of powder were scattered about every where &amp; the air filled with fire &mdash; but all escaped without harm to any person</p><closer><signed><name type="person">Theodore A Bell</name></signed> <pb n="[4]"/> <address><addrLine><name type="person">Mrs. <abbr expan="Ann Jane">A.
