If the property of the company is forced to sale for cash my opinion is that the state will run the <orig reg="hazard">hazzard</orig> of losing her whole stock__ I have heretofore rested contended     as I presumed no chancellor would refuse to enforce the states lien.  It would therefore be well to consult the attorney general and see whether any thing can be done.  I understand the Chancellor will not grant an appeal without security which of course the state can not give</p>
