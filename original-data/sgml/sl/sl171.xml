Meigs to James Brown, a son of Colonel Joseph Brown. Meigs is advising Brown that recovering his father's slaves from Cherokee chief Coteoyetohee is threatening a peace between the US and the Cherokee and is in violation of a treaty. Meigs reminds Brown that treaties are the highest law and that all are accountable to the law.</note><note type="collection">Joseph Brown Papers</note><note type="box">THS-JB</note><note type="folder">83-86</note><note type="document">sl171</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Cherokee Indians -- Treaties</item><item>Cherokee Indians -- Government relations</item><item>Slavery</item><item>Southern States</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Highwassee Garrison</name> <date value="1815-02-19">19th February 1815</date>.</addrLine></address><salute>Sir</salute></opener><p>I have received your letter of the <date value="1815-01-03">3rd.
