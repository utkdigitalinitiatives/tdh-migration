Polk marks the letter as confidential as he explains the importance of selecting the appropriate editor for a paper called the "Union."  He says the paper  would be a strategic voice for the Democratic party in the state of Tennessee, and that the public must remain unaware of what is being arranged by the parties.  Polk would go on to become the 11th president of the United States in 1845. </note><note type="collection">Heiss Papers</note><note type="box">Correspondence</note><note type="folder">11</note><note type="document">sl457</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee -- History</item><item>Letters</item><item>Polk, James K.</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="Letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine>Columbia</addrLine></address> <date><abbr expan="December">Decr</abbr> 21st -1843-</date> confidential  <salute>My Dear Sir!</salute></opener><p>I have received your letter of yesterday I am very anxious for the reasons assigned to <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> Hogan and yourself__ that the Union should be made a more vigorous and efficient paper, than I fear <abbr expan="Mister">Mr</abbr> Hogan's present state of health will enable him to make it.

I would much prefer this arrangement, - to see Mr H. sell his interest to a third person whose future course in conducting the establishment - might be uncertain, and indeed such as to injure the cause.  The <pb n="[2]"/> Editor <add>who is</add> to be preferred  above all others,__ for the coming contest__ is our friend Laughlin.

What we want is a sound__ and able Democratic paper__ as a reliable organ of the party in the state.__ He would make it say whilst some others into whose hands it might pass, might not.__ It is a matter of importance,__ that whatever arrangement is made should be speedily made.  The public must know nothing of what is contemplated, until it is <orig reg="consummated">consumated</orig>__ and arranged by the parties.__ In whatever is done I must urge__ that Laughlin's services be secured during the canvass of the next year.</p><p>After closing this letter, I will envelope it to <abbr expan="General">genl</abbr> Armstrong.__ that it may go directly into your hands,__ and not run the risk of falling into the general package for your office <add>and run the risk of being opened by your clerk</add> .__ I would mention to Armstrong its general purport, <del>and</del> of course <orig reg="confidentiality">confidentuality</orig>, and desire that you will have an early interview with him.__ Any arrangement agreed upon between you and him, with Hogan's assent will be agreeable <pb n="[3]"/> to me as a member of the party.__</p><p>You see our paper here has taken ground for <name><abbr expan="Van Buren">V Buren</abbr></name> I mentioned to Hogan and yourself the propriety of the Union's doing The same things:__ to which I understood you both to assent.__ Since my return home I am the more confirmed in the views then expressed.__ <name>A.V.
