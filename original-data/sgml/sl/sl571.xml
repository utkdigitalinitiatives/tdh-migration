At <name>Carthage</name> 190 votes were taken, of which Sullivan got 120. at <unclear>Briwards</unclear> on <name>Loon Creek</name> , 222 were taken, of which he got 3. those are the only places I have heard from I have (a few days since) returned from an excursion on <name>Elk</name>. &amp; while there, was at the mouth of Me <gap/> when the <unclear><gap/> river</unclear>  was taken, <gap/> Court) which is intend to establish Rutledges <gap/> 1000, arms on that River. And Knowing tha <gap/> have an Interest there, I attended to the examination as follows to <orig reg="wit">witt</orig> . that in the latter part of the year 1787 or the beginning of 1788. he was not certain which, he then being deputy Surveyor, for the middle District, was <orig reg="applied">applyed</orig> to by <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> <name>Elijah Robertson</name> to Survey a quantity of Land which he Robertson had located on the Middle <del type="overstrike">wake of</del> <pb n="[2]"/> &amp; South forks of Elk River. &amp; Said he would send <name>Turner Williams</name> with him, to Show him the <orig reg="beginning">begining</orig>. accordingly he set out with Williams and a man by the name of <name>Ring</name>. who conducted him to a <orig reg="Birch">Berch</orig> tree Standing 20, or 30 yards below the mouth of <name>Mulberry</name>, (which he was at when examined) marked ER and SB. which appeared very old. and <add>told</add> him that the <unclear>flow</unclear> Mulberry, was the middle fork of Elk. that while there, they were alarmed by Indians &amp;  went home without doing anything. that a few years after that t <gap/> went again, in company with two other men whose <gap/> could not then recollect. and made a begining, on <gap/> elder &amp; Maple, standing near the bank of the me <gap/> rk, and about thirty yards from the Berch before mentioned. he designated a spot, &amp; said that it was within twenty feet of that place but on examination there was not the least vestige of such timber to be found. he was Asked the size of the corner trees. on which he pointed to a small <unclear>srub</unclear> ; not as large as chair post, and said about the size of that. within the area, which he designated there are Eight or ten, Sound Sizable trees, any of which would have done well for Corner trees. and the soil, is very rich, black, &amp; mellow, and such as the maple, is seldom or never found to Grow on. The above is Given from memory, &amp; may not be verbatimly, but it is substantially correct.  I am yet at a loss for a vice president, having objections to all that has been named for that appointment. <del type="overstrike">yh chor</del> If there was no possible chance for the vice president Se <gap/> ding to the presidential functions, I should be easier <gap/> but when I consider that <del type="overstrike">that</del> he may eventually  <unclear><gap/>of the ? ought</unclear> to be Great <unclear>case</unclear> <gap/> making the Selection. I <unclear>ruin</unclear> the character of <gap/> nton, as much as any man does, &amp; I think he ought to be placed on the list of the best men in America, but he is too old for that office &amp; those his supporters (mostly,) (I mean for the presidency) are men whose views are at Variance with the Established maxims of this country, and who wish to divert the Current of the Government into a different channel and they think, that by taking the advantage of the <unclear>inlucidity</unclear> of his mind, naturally rather weak than otherwise, &amp; having become <pb n="[3]"/> more so, by the <orig reg="pressure">presure</orig> of Swentyfive years__ they might in Some measure effect their purpose. that his mental <add>powers</add> are impaired, is verified, by his Great Solicitude for the presidency.</p><p><name>Mr Munrow</name>, is a citizen of the same state with <name>Mr Madison</name> &amp; I think it would not be good policy, to take both of President &amp; vice president, from the some section of the union, for Great Jealousies, &amp; discontents have <gap/>  dy manifested themselves Eastwards, in consequence <gap/> Growing Influence of <name>Virginia</name> in the <unclear><gap/></unclear> him it would be best, to take the vice preside <gap/> East. again he has spent several of his last <gap/> at foreign courts in Despotic, &amp; Monarchial Governments. &amp; how far his political creed may have become contaminated thereby is not ascertained, at any rate, he has not been home long enough to prove to his Brethren, that he come home with clean Garments. &amp; furthermore, while at the east court <add>to wit <abbr expan="Great Britain">GB.</abbr></add> in the discussion of some of the most important points of difference, between the two nations, he did not maintain that high, manly, dignified,  &amp; Independent tone, which the nature of the subject required of an American Ministr <gap/></p><p>As to <name>Mr Adams</name>, he has too laterly immerged from a System of politics, which aims at the vitals of our Government. Should monday next declare me, Elector, Should be glad of your <orig reg="views">veiws</orig> on this subject. for in that event Should <add>also</add> be glad, to know the public senti <gap/> t so far as respects the vice president.
