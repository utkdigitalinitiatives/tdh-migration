			 <note type="summary">This document is a letter dated October 18, 1820 from the governor of Tennessee, Joseph McMinn to N. Starry.  The subject of the letter is the crafting of two swords of quality and workmanship to be inscribed with the names of Major Generals Andrew Jackson, and Edmund P. Gaines, and a brief note of esteem for their service in the war against Great Britain.  The swords are intended to be gifts from the state of Tennessee; McMinn offers Starry $1800 for the crafting, inscription, and delivery of the two swords to Washington, City. (D.C.)</note>
