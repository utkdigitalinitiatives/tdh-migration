The Cherokee lands in that quarter may be estimated at about one million three hundred thousand acres. The <name>Tennessee</name> line will divide the tract probably nearly in <gap/><unclear>equal</unclear> parts as to quantity leaving a very valuable tract lying on <unclear>the</unclear> river not less than fifty miles included in the mississippi Territory The title to this tract probably might be extinguished at the same time if the Executive should think proper to direct it. It would be saving of some expense &amp; perhaps determine the Indians in that quarter to go over the Mississippi where a great many of their friends are already gone the last year.</p>
