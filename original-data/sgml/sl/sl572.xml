I now avail myself of the <abbr expan="opportunity">oppty</abbr> to inform you, that the explanations given in that letter, respecting my son__  is satisfactory.  and I repeat my wish for him to continue in your service.  We hear that about 1200 <orig reg="Volunteers">Volunters</orig> appeared at <name>Fayettville</name>, for the purpose of proceeding to the south.  Their commander (<abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Hayns) declared, he knew not their destination.  we also hear, that a large force go from the <name>cherokees</name>__ on the same expedition.

I am glad <pb n="[2]"/> that the directors of the <name><abbr expan="United">U</abbr> States</name> bank have determined to send a branch to <name>Nashville</name> The resolution of Our legislature to the contrary not withstanding.
