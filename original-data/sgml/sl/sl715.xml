It is the ardent wish of the President of the <name>United States</name> to give every facility in his power to the communication between the citizens of <name>Tennessee</name> and <name>Kentucky</name> and the <name>atlantic</name> States and to render the trade and Navigation of the Western States as convenient as possible.__ <pb n="[2]"/> He has it in contemplation to have a road opened from <name>Tennessee</name> to the boatable waters of <name>Georgia</name>.__</p><p>When your Legislature shall have decided on the most eligible rout through the counties of Davidson and Williamson is it not <del>probable</del>   probable some aid will be offered by the State for completing the road?__ Every aid will be offered <orig reg="cheerfully">chearfully</orig> in the power of the President for carrying into complete effect the original plan for making the road.__  But we ought by all the means in our power to guard against any unnecessary extension of the distance__ It ought not to be expected that a great public road made for the purpose of connecting two distant countries, and national purposes should be averted from the shortest and best route merely to accommodate the Inhabitants of a Single County</p>
