The only apology I have to offer for the intrusion, is the motive, which prompts me to the presumption. I beg leave to congratulate myself on taking this opportunity which I have <orig reg="designed">desined</orig> for some time of declaring my attachment for You, <unclear>asked</unclear> of soliciting an interest in my <orig reg="favor">favour</orig>.</p><p>I know Your own heart is too sincere to suspect treachery in another, or suffer Your ear to be caught by the <unclear>synen</unclear> voice of flattery. I therefore hope as I have engaged in the subject, you will permit me to tell You, with all the <orig reg="candor">candour</orig> and frankness I am capable of assuming. that I love You with all the fervency with which woman is capable of being, &caret; <add place="supralinear">loved</add> and If You are not otherwise engaged may I presume to solicit  a place in Your friendship and Love. &mdash; If my love is reciprocated by Yourself it shall be my study and exertion to merit Your affection, and if I can obtain that felicity which You are formed to bestow I shall be happy indeed. My heart beats high in expectation of its fancied joys. My <orig reg="imagination">immagination</orig> paints in alluring <orig reg="colors">colours</orig>, the charms of Your <pb n="[2]"/> Youth and beauty  regulated by virtue and innocence, and associated with all that is mild pure and benevolent. Of these I wish to partake. &mdash;</p><p><del type="overstrike">Your attention to this sute</del> I have said enough to awaken Your attention to this subject. I hope you will not be offended by my freedom. If it appears of little or no consequence to Yourself. You will at least ascribe the mention of it to motives of sincere regard in Your friend and loner; and if it should meet with Your approbation. I hope to conduct myself with the like <orig reg="honor">honour</orig> and integrity that I have the satisfaction of knowing I never Yet violated. &mdash;</p><p>It may be that this is rather a sudden affair to You, and that You cannot answer without consideration. Take what time You may think proper. Our short acquaintance renders it impossible<unclear> for me to decide</unclear> what the operations of Your mind may be. I am compelled now to quit the subject and leave You to the exercise of Your own free will, which I hope will coincide with my present wishes. In Your breast I will repose my cause. &mdash;</p><p>In conclusion I now offer You my heart and hand. What more Can I say: What more can I offer. I have neither Rank Wealth or <orig reg="Splendor">Splendour</orig> to bestow; but will promise to devote myself to Your happiness, and endeavour to prove a friend worthy of being  rewarded by Your love and Your <orig reg="society">sosiety</orig>. &mdash; <pb n="[3]"/> <name type="person">Mr N B Hamilton</name> my particular and confidential friend will deliver You this letter. If its contents should meet with Yours approbation and I am so fortunate as to be considered deserving Your choice, or worthy to be selected as Your Companion in the <orig reg="necessitudes">necissitudes</orig> of life. You will make it known by keeping it. But if after a satisfactory consideration of &caret; <add place="supralinear">the</add> matter. You arrive at a different conclusion, You will please return it through the same person by whom it is handed to you.</p><p>With sentiments of the highest regard and purest love I have the <orig reg="honor">honour</orig> to subscribe myself  Most respectfully your friend and servant &mdash;</p><closer><signed><name type="person"><emph><abbr expan="James">Jas</abbr> L.
