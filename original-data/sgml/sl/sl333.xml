Howell to Adam Fergusson, dated February 13. It was written in the late 1840's. Howell asks for Fergusson's help in a deal Howell made with H. H. Holland, Buck Hart, and Mr. Farley.  Howell writes that he misses Tennessee, and that it was the happiest time of his life. He writes that he likes Wisconsin partly because it is a Democratic state. Howell is disappointed that the Whig party won the last election. He hopes they will not reverse the decisions, policies, and laws of the previous administration.</note><note type="collection">Fergusson Papers</note><note type="box"> IV-G-1 b4</note><note type="folder">2</note><note type="document">sl333</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Business enterprises</item><item>Tennessee -- Politics and government -- To 1865</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Aztalan</name> <abbr expan="February">Feby</abbr> 13 184<gap reason="document torn"/></addrLine></address><salute>Dear Sir,</salute></opener><p>You may doubtless recollect that I <unclear>once</unclear> lived in <name type="place">Carthage</name> and took a warm interest in the success of the Democratic Party and the triumph of its principles__ so much so that I bartered a little according to the fashion of the times, on the final result__ I made our deal with <name type="person">H.
