Temple to Thomas E. Abernathy dated February 23, 1839. Temple comments on how nice the weather has been and how blessed he is that all his family and friends are doing well.  He writes about the trial of James McCaw, who was found guilty of murdering Jonas Bowers and the great excitement that surrounded the trial. Temple also writes that if the man, Mr. Loveless, who takes care of their land does not do more work, that Abernathy should discharge him.</note><note type="collection">Abernathy Papers</note><note type="box">II-H-3</note><note type="folder">F 13</note><note type="document">sl095</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Trials (Murder)</item><item>Letters</item><item>McCaw, James</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/> <opener><add place="left of address">&rcub;</add><address><addrLine><name type="place"><orig reg="Greenville">Greeneville</orig> <abbr expan="Tennessee">Ten</abbr></name></addrLine><addrLine><date value="1839-02-23"><orig reg="February">Febuary</orig> 23d,, 1839.</date></addrLine></address><salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener><p>I gladly embrace the present opportunity of writing you a few lines  and <orig reg="more">moore</orig>.&mdash; I arrived home on the <orig reg="9th">9</orig> day after I left your house; though I had some <orig reg="very">vary</orig> cold weather &amp; <orig reg="Rough">Ruff</orig> Roads to travel over.
