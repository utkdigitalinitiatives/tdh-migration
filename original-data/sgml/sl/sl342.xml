Walker, a Whig,  writes about political matters, and he apparently was not aware that Fergusson was an active democrat for he expresses his disapproval for democrats such as Van Buren and Polk.  He also includes a short biography about himself, in which he relates some of his experiences in the Revolutionary War, and he  mentions the monetary value of his slaves.</note><note type="collection">Fergusson Papers</note><note type="box"> IV-G-1 b5</note><note type="folder">7</note><note type="document">sl342</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Tennessee -- Politics and government -- To 1865</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name>Cumberland County <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr></name> <date>March 7th 1839</date></addrLine></address><salute>Sir,</salute></opener><p>Your letter of the <date>2nd <abbr expan="December">Decr.</abbr> 1838</date> was not received until the 2nd <abbr expan="Instant">Inst.</abbr> This delay was produced by its being sent to the Court House, where I have not been for the last five years, and by its falling into the hands of a <orig reg="Locofoco">Loco foco</orig> Post Master, who, although it was marked "PAID" was unwilling    to give it up until he was paid.
