In the letter, Blount discusses political aspects of Tennessee at the time, including impeachments, a Cherokee treaty, political appointments, and land demand being very low in Tennessee.

I think it is hardly worth while to hold a man to Jail when he is not charged with having committed any offence &mdash; He has published a pamphlet showing his views and containing <unclear></unclear> of his treatment during his imprisonment &mdash; it is too large to pay postage on or I would send it you &mdash; <name type="person">Bennet</name> and <name type="person">Robert Searcy</name> were both married during my stay at Nashville to <name type="person">Miss Polly</name> and <name type="person">Betsy Windle</name> all of whom you have an acquaintance with &mdash; <name type="person">Hugh L.
