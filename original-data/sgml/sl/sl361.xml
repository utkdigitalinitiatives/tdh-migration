It is Rev. Finis Ewing from  Rev. James Smith. Smith is travelling and relates the state of the Cumberland Presbyterian churches he has visited. He is very upset and disheartened. He writes that the Methodists are making converts, and that many of the churches lose so many members that the are no more. Smith is upset that there are many in the church with differing theologies. He describes the unorthodox beliefs of some. Smith  is worried that heresy will take over the church. Smith mentions that this trip has been bad for his business at home, and that he has been borrowing money from different people.</note><note type="collection">Finis Ewing Papers</note><note type="box">I-A-4</note><note type="folder">17</note><note type="document">sl361</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Alabama</item><item>Cumberland Presbyterian Church</item><item>Religious thought - 19th century</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><salute><abbr expan="Brother">Br,,</abbr> Ewing</salute></opener><p><add cert="different hand, ink">January 1837</add> <orig reg="Believing">Beleiving</orig> that I owe you a letter and having stopped at a Brothers for the night and finding myself without company as without employment and seeing the old stump of an old pen thick with ink and dirt.
