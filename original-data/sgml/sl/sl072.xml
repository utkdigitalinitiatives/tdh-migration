Hamilton to  Doctor James L. Alexander on November 5, 1838. In the letter, Hamilton discusses several social events that have occurred in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, including a Ladies' Fair and participating in the activities at a local singing school. Hamilton also mentions that a volunteer company has gone to the Cherokee Nation, but he does not know why they have gone there. He concludes the letter by stating that the corn crop will be good in his area that year, but little fruit will be available for sale.</note><note type="collection">Alexander Papers Correspondence</note><note type="box">VI-G-2</note><note type="folder">2</note><note type="document">sl072</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee -- Description and travel</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><orig reg="Bachelors">Batchelors</orig>-Hall &mdash; <name type="place">Tennessee</name> <date value="1834-05-11">May 11th 1834</date></addrLine></address><salute>My Dear Friend</salute></opener><p>I have once more concluded to <orig reg="break">brake</orig> silence, I hope you will not think <orig reg="hard">heard</orig> of me for not writing to you sooner, as I will try and a make up the loss time in my letter, I shall give you the news in general &mdash; The Ladies fair took place in <name type="place">Murfreesboro</name> on the first day of this month, I did not attend as the times are <orig reg="hard">heard</orig> and <orig reg="money">mony</orig> scarce, I thought it best for me to keep out of all such scrapes, if I wished to save my &mdash; credit. &mdash; I have been <orig reg="told">toled</orig> since, <orig reg="they">thay</orig> figured largely &mdash; <orig reg="There">Thare</orig> were upwards of three hundred persons <orig reg="there">thare</orig>, lots and <orig reg="gobs">gobbs</orig> of girls. some very <orig reg="pretty">prety</orig> ones as you may well guess, And some as ugly as the devil, <orig reg="Admittance">Admitance</orig> 25 <add place="supralinear"><abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr></add> to the fair, to the supper $1.00, which you know when put <orig reg="together">to gether</orig> make $ one twenty five.
