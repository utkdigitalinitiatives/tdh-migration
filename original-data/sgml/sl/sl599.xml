West from this place.</p><p>I went to San Fernando, 90 miles, but was on the 28th ordered to march back to this place, to procure supplies for the army.</p><p>No Troops are now, or will be left on this route.__With 50 or 60 men, &amp; about 100 teamsters I am ordered to march to Victoria, through the bilingo country. We do not expect opposition yet we know that any of the Towns intervening, together with a few neighboring ranchos, could assemble 4 or 500 men, to dispute our passage.  We do expect it, because we believe, that a majority of the people are averse to engaging in our military expedition__ <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr>. Couales, is said to be 30 or 40 miles north of San Fernando, with from100 to 500 Rancheros: again he is reported to be within  a few miles of  the  City.  Yesterday, when we came in sight of Town,  a sectorial reported 500 Cavalry in sight; a patrol was sent to resist us, &amp; the whole city seemed to be quite alarmed, until they saw we were friends, and not Mexicans under Couales.<pb n="2"/> Tomorrow we leave, again to march the dry, &amp; hot plains, this side of San Fernando: again to march from morning to night without water for ourselves or horses.</p><p><orig reg="Not important">N. inporte!</orig> We can not complain. We came to serve our country, &amp; we are now doing it.</p><p>"The two <del type="overstrike">points</del> great points of our army says a great General, are the front &amp; rear: &amp; of the two the rear is the more important" So you see, although placed in the rear, we have a more dangerous march than if we had gone in front.</p><p>Your kindness in forwarding the Muster Roll is gratefully felt. Please accept my thanks, therefore.</p><p>Please present my dutiful respects to his Excellency, Gov. Brown, &amp; say to him that I shall endeavor hereafter to send a copy of each Muster Roll of my company to your office, to be filed there, according to his request.</p>
