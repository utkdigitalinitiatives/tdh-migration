It is to Andrew Jackson Donelson in the care of Major Thomas B. Eastland, from his brother Daniel S. Donelson. Andrew is returning from Texas where he has been conducting annexation negotiations. Daniel is considering a trip to Washington D.C. in relation to some land that he wants near the Rio Grande. He hopes to meet William Marcy, President Polk's Secretary of War. Daniel writes to Andrew that he wishes that Andrew could have made it to General Andrew Jackson's deathbed. Daniel expresses regret that General Houston did not make it either, until right after Jackson had died.</note><note type="collection">Bettie Donelson Papers</note><note type="box">III-E-2-3, b1</note><note type="folder">6</note><note type="document">sl373</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Tennessee</item><item>Jackson, Andrew, 1767-1845</item><item>Houston, Samuel, 1793-1863</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name>Hendersonville</name></addrLine><addrLine><date>June 23rd,, 1845</date></addrLine></address><salute>Dear Andrew</salute></opener><p>I have <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> some two letter from you, whilst in <name><abbr expan="New">N.</abbr> Orleans</name>, which I certainly intended to answer ere' this, on the subject of my application for the <name>sutler</name> place on the <name>Rio' Grande'</name>, at  the same time urging me to visit <name>Washington</name> on that account.
