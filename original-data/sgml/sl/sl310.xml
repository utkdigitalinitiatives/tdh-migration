Col</abbr> <name type="person">Henry Dixon</name>, for seven years half pay to the widow, but at my request the Committee did not make any report in the case during that session. At the first session of the present congress you are aware that nothing was done on the subject of private claims, and at the beginning of of this session the claim of the Heirs of Col Henry Dixon I had again referred to the Committee on revolutionary claims but as yet no report has been made upon the case. I have frequently urged the chairman to make a report, and he has promised to do so, but I know not whether it will be for or against the claim. I have explained the nature of the claim fully to the chairman &amp;  <unclear>other members</unclear> of the committee I think the claim ought to be allowed &amp; if a favourable report can be had from the committee, a law can be <pb n="[2]"/> be passed for the benefit of the heirs. Before this reaches you, the storm about <name type="place">Texas</name> will have passed off, and the invasion by <name type="place">mexico</name> will have all ended in <unclear>rumor</unclear> As to the acquisition of Texas by the <name type="place"><abbr expan="United">U</abbr> States</name> that is impossible as there is scarcely a single member of Congress from any of the free States who would agree to it &amp; there are many from the Slave States who are against it_ I should like to see Texas united with us, but I have no hope of it_ There has been much said about war but I sincerely hope we shall have none There is no sufficient cause for war, and nothing but vile personal ambition of those who rule, &amp; who will have all the honor &amp; profit, will rush us into war at present The differences can be amicably settled by negotiation, &amp; should be. The country has much to fear from a reckless administration</p><closer><salute>Very respectfully yours</salute><signed><name type="person">W B Campbell</name></signed><address><addrLine><name type="person">A Fergusson</name><abbr expan="Esquire">Esqr</abbr></addrLine></address></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
