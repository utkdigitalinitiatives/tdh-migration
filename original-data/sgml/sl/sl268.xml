Williams is trying to convince House to give him some medicine. The medicine is some kind of pill that House has declared he would not give out for moral reasons. Williams swears that if House will allow him to take some, he will not let anyone else know. He also promises to pay whatever is asked to House if the pills cure him.</note><note type="collection">Orr Collection IV-J-2</note><note type="box">3</note><note type="folder">12</note><note type="document">sl268</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Medical care</item><item>Pills</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><date value="1843-03-09"><abbr expan="March">Mar</abbr> the 9th 1843</date></addrLine></address><salute>Mr House</salute></opener><p>I again write you a few lines asking of you if it is in your power to let me have the pills to take at home.

I would knot Mr House ask them of you if it was not for my low situation and you have had the feelings of one in my situation and I hope it will induce you to let me have them you may think it a little strange <unclear>in me</unclear> to ask it of you since you wrote to me what you did. I have <unclear>such</unclear> strong confidence in it <pb n="[2]"/> curing me that I am anxious to give it another trial at home which I know if I then fail it will not be my fault as I should use all possible means to take care of myself. write to me and let me know if you can let me have them and if you can I will come down immediately. and if the medicine should cure me I will give you one hundred dollars or as much <unclear>money</unclear> as you should ask.</p><closer><salute>Yours</salute><signed><name type="person">J.
