Martin writes mostly about the current political situation. He mentions France, the economy, and Congress. Martin is disappointed with the lack of progress Tennessee is making.

It is with much pleasure I hear of the continued health,&amp;  prosperity of a long tried friend_ &amp; one too who has been well proved &amp; found sound to the core. reciprocal &amp; well confirmed friendship, is one of the highest enjoyments experienced in <unclear>social</unclear> life. How pleasant to have a friend to whom we can on all occasions unbosom our whole heart.</p><p>The Presidents message at the meeting of the 17th congress, is less Interesting than any of the Kind which I have seen this I suppose is owing to the steady &amp; <unclear>unterrupted</unclear> state of our national affairs. However that of our commercial relations with <name>France</name> is an exception The extent of this evil I suppose not to be great, as it respects a partial part of our commerce only. The complaint of France about the <unclear>apollo</unclear> , and their rights at <name>New orleans</name>, appear to have so little foundation that she will not (I think) sincerely urge them.</p><p>As was to have been expected the P has touched the Florida dispute with a sparing &amp; tender hand.

How this evil is to be <orig reg="remedied">remidied</orig> , in the present ignorant, &amp; <unclear>vitiated</unclear> state of society I Know not For in the choice of men to represent us in that body, we see that merit in the estimation of the Electors, is but a minor consideration. Hence <orig>untill</orig> we become more wise &amp; more virtuous, we shall in this respect be no better off. It appears to me, that all the other states so far as my information goes, are improving. But poor Tennessee, is retrograding or at best stationary. I take no pleasure in entertaining this opinion of the country which I love above all others. And it is this high regard I have for my state, which makes me feel, so pungently on the occasion.</p><p>Are reforms hopeless? cannot the old leaven be purged out? And cannot the people be brought to see their best Interest?</p><p>I have sometimes thought that attempts of this kind would be vain. But from <pb n="[3]"/> the great importance of the occasion, <del type="overstrike">anoth</del> and effort ought to be made.
