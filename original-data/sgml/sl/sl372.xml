We were all much pleased to hear that you had reached that place in saf <add>e</add> ty and with less fatigue than was anticipated in consequence of the bad roads. Nothing has transpired here upon your farm out of the usual way since you left, every thing is moving on smoothly __ about twenty thousand pounds of cotton was picked out last week, it is opening finely, and I have no doubt will continue to do so having had a few mornings <add>since</add> a slight frost enough to check its growth without injury to the balls __  you are now <del type="overstrike">certain</del> I think certain of a fine crop of this article and every nerve should be exerted for its speedy housing __ my advice therefore <pb n="[2]"/> to <name>mr Holiday</name> is that he should keep an eye single to the this object as the season is a good way advanced. All are well both white and black with the exception of my youngest child, who has been quite <orig reg="sick">sicke</orig> of chill and fever. the next <unclear>peroniner</unclear> comes on tomorrow morning I am in <add>hopes</add> we will be enabled to stop. In regard to the management and care of your children I hope you will be under no apprehensions as I assure that both margaret and myself will do our utmost in our attentions to them, as much so as though they were our own.</p><p>All relatives are well save the wife of cousin William who is said to be dangerously ill of congestive fever.
