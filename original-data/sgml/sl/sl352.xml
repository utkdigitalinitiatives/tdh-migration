And am now under the necessity of relinquishing the <unclear>idea</unclear> of seeing you now.  But I have prevailed upon <abbr expan="Brother">Bro.</abbr> <name>McKorkle</name> to visit the upper counties for me, and he will be the bearer of this.  He will consult you on the subject of obtaining agents or missionaries for <name><orig reg="Lafayette">Layfayette</orig></name>, <name>Jackson</name>, <name>Clay</name> &amp; <name>Ray</name> Counties,- it is necessary that agents or missionaries should be laboring in these counties immediately.  Now is the season to have the schools <orig reg="organized">organised</orig>-- and now is the time to <pb n="[2]"/> have the Resolution of the Am. S.S. Union completed.  If you can afford us any assistance, or rather if you can do any thing to help forward this work of the Lord-- We will pray that the <unclear>province</unclear> may be fulfilled to you-- "He that <unclear>watcheth</unclear>," <abbr expan="et cetera">&amp;c</abbr></p><p>Revivals of religion are prevailing in some parts of our state-- some <unclear><abbr>Sab. sch.</abbr></unclear> are wonderfully blessed.

I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you in June or July, as I expect to return to these parts in a few weeks.  <unclear>Heavens chorus &amp;</unclear> blessing descend upon you &amp; yours-- so prays your abundant servant in the Lord.</p><closer><signed>A.
