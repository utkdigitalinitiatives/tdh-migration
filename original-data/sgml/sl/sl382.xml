Boggs of Missouri.  Gaines writes from near Boonsville, Arkansas and informs Boggs of a council being called by the Cherokee in Arkansas to which several Native American nations of the frontier region were invited.  He expresses concern as to the intention behind this council and gratefully reports that the Delawares and Shawnees  have refused the invitation.</note><note type="collection">Gaines Papers</note><note type="box">I-C-3</note><note type="folder">2</note><note type="document">sl382</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>Gaines, Edmund Pendleton, 1777-1849 Correspondence.</item><item>Arkansas</item><item>Cherokee Indians</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/> <opener><address><addrLine><abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd.

It was therefore inferred by <pb n="[2]"/> the Delawares and Shawnees that the nation calling the council, had some sinister motive in this artful concealment, such as might give just cause of offence to the United States.  They had therefore unanimously determined not to attend "the great Council."</p><p><name><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Colonel Mason</name> reports to me that he had not been able to ascertain whether the chiefs or Braves of any of the nations West, or Northwest of the state of Missouri had consented to attend; but he was under the impression that most of them would follow the praiseworthy example of the Delawares and Shawnees, and not attend the council. Such a determination would effectually prostrate any hostile schemes which the <name>Mexican</name> party of the Cherokees may have had in view against our frontier.</p><p>Believing the conduct of these friendly Indians upon this occasion, will operate as a salutary rebuke upon the restless and intriguing part of the Cherokee Nation, and their old friends the faithless part of the <name>Creeks</name>, and <name>Seminoles</name>,- a rebuke well calculated to restrain effectually their spirit of intrigue and hostility; and deeming the moral effect of such a <pb n="[3]"/> rebuke, coming from their Red neighbors, to be altogether better than if it had come from me, or <add>from</add> any other officer of the Government; I have determined not to pay so much respect to the "great council" as to make it the visit which I had intended.</p><p><name>Brigadier General Arbuckle</name>, the commanding General of the 2nd Department of this Division of the army, is stationed near the spot where the council is to be held; and having been for some years past on duty near these southern Indians, is well acquainted with the Character of their Chiefs, and will not fail to inform himself of their designs and keep them in check.  I expect soon to receive his report of their conduct in the great council, and should it contain anything particularly interesting to the state of Missouri, I will lose no time in sending to you a Copy.</p> <closer><salute>I have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your <abbr expan="Obedient Servant">Obdt.
