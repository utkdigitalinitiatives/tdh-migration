I intended to have written you long since, but have been so engaged in business, when my health would<del type="overstrike">admit</del> <add place="supralinear">permit</add> , since we returned home, that I have not done one half of what I should have done, in the way of letter writing. In relation to your Pile Ointment, I must say, I believe it will cure any ordinary case of piles, if used agreeably to the directions, but mine have been of so long standing, I doubt a permanent cure being affected, yet I have derived great benefit from the use of your ointment, more, far more, than from any <orig reg="preparation">prepartion</orig> I have &caret; <add place="supralinear">ever</add> used, &amp; I believe I have used every preparation, I ever heard of, commencing at last Sixteen years ago. &mdash; I consider your Pills inferior to none. That I have tried, &amp; think they are bound to do well, wherever they &caret; <add place="supralinear">are</add> known &mdash; I wish you great success in your business, hoping it may be profitable to you, &amp; <orig reg="beneficial">beneficail</orig> &caret; <add>to</add> mankind. &mdash; <pb n="[2]"/> Mr. House, I believe I mentioned to you that my Stepson, <unclear></unclear> A. Fort, had a considerable amount of money, at least $4500 when he left home; &mdash; well sir, I have never been able to <unclear>trace</unclear> it up, I can not find any thing among  his paper showing what he done with it.</p><p>He told his friends in <name type="place"><abbr expan="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr></name> that his money was in Nashville, but &caret; <add place="supralinear">did</add> not say in &caret; <add place="supralinear"><unclear>whose</unclear></add> hands he had placed it, I thought it likely he had deposited it in Bank, &amp; got a friend from <name type="place">Clarksville</name> to inquire, he could learn nothing whatever in relation to; I have since thought, he may possibly have left it with some individual, who may have forgotten it, I am at a loss to conjecture what has become of it.&mdash; I must think it is in Nashville somewhere. &mdash; I therefore have concluded to get you if you please to make some, &amp; such, inquiry, as you may think most likely to succeed; it is  a good deal of money to loose these hard times; &amp; trust it may yet be obtained. you will greatly oblige Mrs. Ross by attending to this request.</p><p>Mrs. Ross desires to be remembered, in the warmest terms, to <name type="person">Mrs. Hamilton</name>, &amp; is sadly disappointed in not having her company this winter in Mi. &mdash; Tell her she must come down as soon as she can. &mdash; We all remember her, &amp; the whole family with pleasure, &amp; desire to be presented to all with sentiments of esteem high regards, yourself particularly included.
