To be sure, I have not much strengthened any obligation resting on you to write, by keeping up the shot myself, and now that I am seated for the purpose of writing I am somewhat at a loss for something to say You learned months ago that I was at the General Assembly last spring and it may be, have already declared vengeance against the "Indian Chief." I mean on account of some of the transactions of the <gap desc="Assembly"/> respecting your presbytery <abbr expan="et cetera">&amp;c</abbr> .</p><p> I should perhaps have written on this subject long ago, but a press of business of various kinds (it may be, mixed with a good stock of mental laziness) has prevented me till now. My only reason for having, <name>Lexington</name> presbytery attached to <name>Arkansas</name> Synod was, to enable us to get in possession of  some more territory in the state of <name>Missouri</name> which we greatly needed and to which we were entitled by every law of prior occupancy. ____ I had been <orig reg="appraised">apprazed</orig> that instead of your Synod wishing to lose any of her territory, she aimed at acquiring more, but for what reason I know not. Now sir, after your presbytery is <unclear>sheared</unclear> , which I hope will be done at the coming session of our Synod, if it be the wish of your presbytery to be reattached to <abbr expan="Missouri">Mo</abbr> synod I pledge, that I will not be the first to oppose it, notwithstanding we very much need and would gladly <pb n="[2]"/> have the counsel of your presbytery in our Synod.</p><p>My little family are well, and have been with very trifling exceptions since I saw you.</p><p>Crops have been greatly shortened (I mean corn crops) by a unusual drought.</p><p>The course of the Redeemer had been languishing for some time  until recently. The camp meeting season has rather changed the moral aspect of our country for the better. On last tuesday night our camp meeting on Cane Hill closed. It resulted in the hopeful conversion of not less than thirty one, out of which, I hope the Lord will make more or less preachers.</p><p>May the Lord carry on his own good wor <gap/> We still have some <name>Cumberland</name> <orig reg="distillers">destillers</orig> and <gap/> of the poisonous stuff!
