In the letter, Andrew and Governor William Blount question the term of service under which the Tennessee Volunteers are obligated to serve. Jackson asks Hall to give the Volunteers orders of service because their term of service has not yet expired. Jackson states that neither he nor the Governor can order the Volunteers, that they can only take orders from General Hall.</note><note type="collection">Tennessee Historical Society</note><note type="box">Miscellaneous documents J1</note><note type="folder">14J</note><note type="document">sl038</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Military planning</item><item>Tennessee</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="person">Brigadier <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Hall</name></addrLine><addrLine>Head Quarters</addrLine><addrLine><name type="person">H Strother</name> &rcub;</addrLine><addrLine><date value="0000-12-21">21st <abbr expan="December">Decr.</abbr></date> <gap reason="document torn"/></addrLine></address><salute>Sir</salute></opener><p>I have, this moment received a letter from <name type="person">Governor Blount</name>, dated on the 7th <abbr expan="Instant">Inst.</abbr> in answer to my inquiries <del type="overstrike">respec</del> respecting the term of service for which the Volunteers, &amp; detached militia were bound; &amp; hasten to send you a copy of it &mdash;</p><p><abbr expan="Although">Altho</abbr> the Governor's ideas in regard to the Volunteers appear to have been more particularly disclosed in a letter which he put into the hands of <name type="person"><abbr expan="Major">Maj.</abbr> Searey</name>, &amp; which I have not yet received, yet it is obvious from the one, of which I now send you a copy, that he does not consider their term of service to have expired &mdash;</p><p>The unwillingness which the Volunteers had manifested to prosecute the Campaign any farther, on the supposition that their term of service had expired on the 10th <abbr expan="Instant">Inst</abbr> &mdash; <unclear>Occasioned</unclear> me to permit them to be marched to <name type="place">Nashville</name>, under your <del type="overstrike">order</del> direction, there to receive such orders as the Governor or <abbr expan="Secretary">Secy</abbr> at War might think proper to give them.
