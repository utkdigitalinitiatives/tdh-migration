Understanding however from your brother  that my name &amp; situation are not unknown to you.  I have mustered resolution enough to trouble you on a piece of business which is shortly as follows.</p><p>My Brother <name type="person">James</name> went out to a mercantile house in <name type="place">Calcutta</name>  in <date value="1815-00-00">1815</date>; and through their <orig reg="favor">favour</orig> and his own deserts, he has  now, at the age of only 23, been lucky enough to get himself established with considerable patronage as a Chinese Agent at <name type="place">Canton</name>, where if he remains for some time, he has every prospect of  making a handsome fortune.  He writes me however that so far as <emph>British Subjects</emph> are  concerned, our English East <name type="place">India</name> Company have the <emph>monopoly</emph> of the <name type="place">China</name> Trade, so that any subject of this Country can only remain there by the <emph>indulgence</emph> of the East India Company's Superb <gap reason="document damaged"/> ous, and are liable to be removed at their pleasure. Now <orig reg="though">tho</orig> this right is sel <gap reason="document damaged"/> and perhaps never very arbitrarily, it must be a most desirable ob <gap reason="document damaged"/> aid of so grievous a restraint upon h <gap reason="document damaged"/> liberty; and one <gap reason="document damaged"/> ed, and an individual made in <gap reason="document damaged"/> of the English Su <gap reason="document damaged"/> mself nominated, as is the case with <gap reason="document damaged"/>     either <emph>Consul</emph> or <emph>Vice C</emph> <gap reason="document damaged"/> for some foreign power; as every foreign power has the same right there with <gap reason="document damaged"/> English East India Company, whose monopoly  takes effect against their own Country men only.</p><p>James has met with a <name type="person">Mr Wilcocks</name>at Canton who is Consul there for the <emph><name type="place">United States of America</name></emph>, and from whom  he thought he had experienced considerable civility from his connection with you, with whom he understood Mr <add place="bottom right">Wilcocks</add>  <pb n="[2]"/> Wilcocks to say, that he has heretofore    carried on some official correspondence. There is no <emph>Vice Consul</emph> however for the United States at Canton; and the object for which I have ventured to address you, is to see whether it would be possible to procure this nominal appointment and character for my Brother James.  There is no Salary I believe attached to the office: At least my Brother has no such thing in view; so that it would cost nothing whatever to the American Government, and if at all attainable would I should hope require no other sacrifice from you, but the trouble  of making an application.  If I can vouch for any thing I think I can assure you he will be no discredit to you; for he is universally allowed to be an uncommonly fine, steady, and well educated, young man &mdash; Should you be Kind enough therefore to take this trouble for him it would be conferring the greatest <orig reg="favor">favour</orig>  on him; and be the result what it may, I shall have to facilitate myself in  making the request, if it shall procure for me the honor of any Answer or notice from so distinguished a relation.</p><p>I cannot express to you how much I felt <orig reg="tantalized">tantalised</orig> by the Accounts in our Newspapers of your stay at  <name type="place">Cowes</name> in the <name type="place">Isle of Wight</name>. Had I anticipated that the Hurricane had done any thing more than touch there, or that you would not have been off before I could possibly <gap reason="document damaged" desc="ha"/> ve arrived after the very first noticed, I should certainly have made it a poin <gap reason="document damaged"/> one to wait on you.  May I <gap reason="document damaged"/> ct that a similar opportunity will be afford <gap reason="document damaged"/> <name type="place">Great Britain</name> <emph>on your</emph> <gap reason="document damaged"/> In the course of the last wint <gap reason="document damaged"/> in with a Mr <gap reason="document damaged"/> from <name type="place">Virginia</name>, and who I beli <gap reason="document damaged"/> ne either in North  or <name type="place">South Carolina</name>, that stated himself to have <gap reason="document damaged"/> with you, and gratified us by speaking of you.  <unclear>Unbelievably</unclear> however it was <gap reason="document damaged"/> us departure from Edinburgh that I fell in with him, so that <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> I waited on him to solicit his further acquaintance, I had only an opportunity of meeting him once.  The intercourse between the two Countries however is now so pleasant and liberal; and there is  <emph>in Edinburgh</emph> at least, such a resort of pleasant well informed American Gentlemen every winter, for the University as well as for travelling, that meeting with acquaintances or friends <add place="bottom, right">of</add> <pb n="[3]"/> of yours may hereafter be more frequent &mdash; I need not assure you how much the pleasure would be enhanced if you put it in my power to <emph>show attention</emph> to any friends of yours by an introduction &mdash; I am also <orig reg="authorized">authorised</orig> to make a similar assurance on the part of my Brother if he can be of use to any of your friends that may have occasion to go to China.  But I must not obtrude on your time further than to request the favor of a reply when you find it convenient, and to subscribe myself, with great respect.</p><closer><salute>My dear Uncle</salute><salute>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">afft</abbr> Nephew</salute><signed><name type="person">Duncan Matheson</name></signed><address><addrLine>His Excellency</addrLine><addrLine>The <name type="person"><abbr expan="Honoroable George Washington">Honble G.
