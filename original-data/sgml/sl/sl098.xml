In the letter, Williams tells Paine that he has won a Senate seat and that there is a small Whig majority in the Senate for the first time. He also mentions a drought that has destroyed most of the corn crop he farms, as well as the tobacco plants. He concludes the letter by asking Paine to either manage or sell some of the land he owns to make up for the money he will lose from the destruction of his crops.</note><note
