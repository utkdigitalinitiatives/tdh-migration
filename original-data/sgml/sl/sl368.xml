He has gone from our sight but his memory lives, <orig reg="let">lit</orig> us be mindful of him, and mark his steps as long as we may enjoy life this world.  Your advice to me concerning our Grandfathers rules and regularities are remarkably good and quite interes<add>ting</add> It is my sincere wish that we may never be so delighted with the follies and vices of the world as not to pursue Grandfathers instructions and advice The time is approaching brother we will have to  transact all the varieties and turns of life within ourselves and by our own assistance.  Our principal guide is gone; that is Grandfather he is no longer alive to aid and assist through the <unclear><orig reg="ambiguous">amiguous</orig></unclear> courses of life. I was very much rejoiced <del type="overstrike">your</del> when I recieved your letter to hear of your <pb n="[2]"/> good health, and the progress that you have made in study since your departure is very considerable It is quite pleasing to me and all the rest of your friends.

There is a probability that I will go some college next session.  Uncle <name>Severn Donelson</name> is very ill with the dropsy and it is the thought by the Doctor that he cannot recover.  Uncle Jackson starts to day to hold treaty with the indians he is not very well.  Aunt and all the rest are <add>in</add> tolerable good health.  Mother is well but very anxious that you would return home <add>a</add>gain <name>Mr Sanders</name> and the rest of the family is well.
