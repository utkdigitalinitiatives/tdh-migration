I have excited her curiosity very much to see you, you must apply yourself  closely to your books, <orig reg="endeavor">endeavour</orig> to improve your present opportunities.  you are both too young to think of consummating matters for some time, in the mean time no efforts will be spared on the part of her Father to give every accomplishment she can get in the best schools of the <name type="place">United States</name>. It is probable you will have an opportunity to see her this Summer, as the Dr. has at present a  private instructor he will probably travel the <orig reg="ensuing">ensueing</orig> Summer and take his teacher with him, I will <orig reg="tell">tel</orig> you know however before they leave, that you <unclear>may</unclear> be prepared to expect them. Since receiving your letter I have been told that a number of the Nashville ladies were in Vicksburg on the 20th <abbr expan="ultimo">utl</abbr>, the   news came too late for me  <pb n="[2]"/> <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr>, I had an idea of going to <name type="place"><abbr expan="New Orleans">NO</abbr></name>  to see them, but feared that my trip would be unavailing, as I was told they would only remain a few days in the City.  I now promise myself <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> the pleasure of seeing them all the ensuing Summer I have the names of <name type="person">Miss Crabb</name> <name type="person">Dunn</name> <name type="person">Norville</name> <name type="person">Woods</name> and some others  I was much pleased to hear that the ladies received the attention at Vicksburg of all the gallants about town there was a Ball on the <unclear>Edlen Kir Kruin</unclear>, and <abbr expan="although">altho'</abbr> there was one on the same night in the City, yet the  <unclear>Edlen Kir Kruin</unclear>, was crowded, I have passed my time since you were here in a quiet business like way, but I confess there is rather too much quiet in <name type="place">Madison <abbr expan="County">Co</abbr></name> for me to stay at home constantly. I am fond of society and you too have but little, and there scattered over a vast country, some five, six and eight miles off, you see your Friends here over a week and probably not oftener than once a month But all this is calculated to make men, industrious and active, to relieve themselves of the <unclear>enure</unclear> which must come over all men so situated, and idle at the same time, Our Legislature has adjourned, at this Session some very important acts were passed, among others the abolishment of Imprisonment for Debt, a Bill to suppress tippling shops and <orig reg="Gaming">Gameing</orig> &mdash; houses, a Bill for the Protection of married-women, besides <unclear>divies</unclear> others.  Our Laws too have been Revised and corrected, and we now have some prospect <unclear>hereafter</unclear> of knowing what are the Laws of <name type="place">Mississippi</name>  <pb n="[3]"/> which hitherto has always been a subject of great doubt by a last Act of the Legislature Crime in Mississippi will be punished in some shape it is to be hoped the act I allude to is an act changing the punishment of several Capital offences to <orig reg="Imprisonment">Improsement</orig> in the <orig reg="Penitentiary">Penetentiary</orig> Our <orig reg="Penitentiary">Penetentiary</orig> is now going on to completion rapidly and will soon be ready to <orig reg="receive">recieve</orig> Convicts, Our State house too a most <orig reg="magnificent">magnificint</orig> building is nearly completed, which when com<gap reason="hole in document"/> will cost over half a <orig reg="million">milion</orig>, I think I am<gap reason="hole in document"/> I could safely advise you when you settle yourself to come to Mississippi we raise fine crops here, and here there is no avocation in life more certain and secure of profit than planting, it is true we sometimes fail to make a full crop, but the increased price, marked up for the deficit, My Brother and his wife both <gap reason="document damaged"/>ire me to remember them to you they are now preparing to leave for your City, it is possible I shall be up with them, I hope you will answer me soon and give all the news, tell me who are married, and who is courting and all about the Girls With this I take leave of you for the present, reluctantly too. I wish I could be with you to tell you a great deal more and possibly you might be more interested as I could then follow the current of your thoughts rather than my own</p><closer><salute>your Friend truly</salute><signed><name type="person">J.H.
