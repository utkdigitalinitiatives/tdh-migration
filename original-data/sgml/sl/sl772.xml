To effect this object to the utmost extent that was practicable in the very <unclear>expeditious</unclear> examination the <orig reg="engineers">enginiers</orig> are instructed at this time to make I found it necessary to call to my aid <abbr expan="Major">Maj</abbr> <name>Thol Brown</name> of Kingston who had an entire knowledge of the country not only along the route we <abbr expan="Viewed">Viewd</abbr> but also that Leading through the Tennessee and <name>Wills town</name> Valleys. and whose information in this respect was of considerable importance to us.
