The state of her mind, rendered so, by her peculiar situation, unfitted her for anything  like social correspondence, though she frequently expressed a wish to write to you, yet she never carried her desire into execution, therefore at this time I write at her request and in her behalf, and situated as she  has been for more than three months, with a greater or less degree of uneasiness pressing her mind, she, I know, will be excusable with you, who have charity abundant enough, to overlook even faults, much like reasonable excuses. Now her trouble is  over she <gap reason="document torn"/> will? have no excuse. She has a fine looking boy, that was born on the <date value="0000-09-21">21st day of <abbr expan="September">Sept.</abbr></date> She is setting up at present attending in a partial degree, to her <orig reg="domestic">domestick</orig> concerns, and the little baby is quite hearty. We have not named it as yet, as we are at a loss, what name we shall adopt, being disposed to give him some name of which no little boy in the <name type="person">Perkin</name>'s family has the same. Three already, have been called after the grandfather, and you know, it is my disposition, to be a little different, and to depart from common customs, for to name him, John Samuel, would be after myself and after his two grandfathers; a name the least objectional, if it were not, the common custom. I admire the name Charles or Frederick, <sic corr="and">and and</sic> as &caret; <add place="supralinear">an</add> evidence thereof, I call all my horses Charley, without <orig reg="exception">acception</orig> .</p><p>I propose then to call him Frederick, rather than Charles, so as <pb n="[2]"/> to distinguish and rather to prevent confounding the name of horses and human beings on the same plantation (excuse me for occupying time &amp; space with reasons, already too tedious)</p><p>I received by last mail, a letter from brother, which informs me of the safe arrival of <name type="person">Thomas</name> at Brookville. I was truly sorry to hear of his indisposition, but I hope he has recovered long before this time, and he has been enjoying himself, in the society of those with whom he formerly lived. I wrote to not to hurry himself back, that all things which concerned him here, were going on well. I got a letter from Miss <name type="person">Patsy Noel</name> this morning, she informs me all things are going on well at Brooklia, and the negroes in good health. <name type="person">Dr Stith</name> lost one of his <orig reg="likeliest">likliest</orig> young fellows. Tell Thomas at his plantation near Brooklia His overseer <unclear></unclear> too much I expect <gap reason="document torn"/> a great many sick. I am getting tired of being confined, so closely at home, I shall leave home, as I have some business abroad that needs my attention, when I shall leave home, I unable at present to say.</p><p>Brother mentioned something about a revisal of Campbellism among the <orig reg="neighbors">neighbours</orig>. O, how strange it is to look back and behold what changes take place in the world! But a few short years ago, I was a student at school, at the gate near <name type="person">Mr. Harris'</name>, now I am in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, living at a house of my own, and have charge of a small family, with all the cares &amp; responsibilities attending it. Thomas no doubt has told you, how I have <orig reg="labored">laboured</orig> and expended money to have every comfort and convenience about me, which this country affords. I have a beautiful little farm, rather a <pb n="[3]"/> source of amusement and expense, than a matter of profit. I would say of it ; that it is just such a summer retreat, as would suit a wealthy <name type="place"><orig reg="Louisiana">Louisiania</orig></name> planter.  It does not suit a poor man like myself for it consumes all my time &amp; income in keeping up appearances. You know I am fond of <unclear>pleasing my eye, even at a ? <gap reason="document torn"/> price.</unclear> Now I feel, that I would feel; that I was fully compensated for expense &amp; trouble, if the family at Brookville could spend one short year with me, and enjoy themselves in these strange woods. Tell father, I am glad to hear he enjoys such fine health, I am in hopes yet, he will visit Tennessee.</p><p>Crops of corn &amp; cotton are worse in this neighbourhood than they were ever known to be. Crops in the District are <gap reason="hole in document"/> have been picking out cotton about two weeks. Cottons opens slowly. I have employed an overseer for next year at $150. The same man I had when Thomas was here. I expect to start to the District in 3 weeks. Hoping these lines may find you enjoying the blessing of health is &caret; <add place="supralinear">the</add> prayer of your brother. Mary unites with  me in sending her love to you, and every member of the family. You must write often to me, and I will answer all your letters with great pleasure, Though I am not in the habit of writing, in the night time, as formerly, owing to the want of eyesight, and thereby, am deprived of one of my greatest earthly enjoyments, I mean corresponding with my friends.</p><closer><salute><abbr expan="Your">Yr.</abbr> Brother affectionately</salute>.<signed><name type="person">John S.
