Sherburne, dated August 25, 1817. Winchester is writing about a town he laid off. He  denies the accusation that he laid it before the area was surveyed. Winchester writes that he waited for the Chiefs to take part in the line running, but that they were so late he had to start without them.  He mentions a treaty that was broken.</note><note type="collection">James Winchester Papers</note><note type="box">2</note><note type="folder">1</note><note type="document">sl487</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl n="4"><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker;
