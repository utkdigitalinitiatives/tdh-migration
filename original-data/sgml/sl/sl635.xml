Gov.</abbr> <name><abbr expan="Neill Smith">N. S.</abbr> Brown</name>, I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> instruction from him to collect all of the Public Arms and accoutrements in this country, and report the same to him when collected. I have now in or about collected them all, and can have them ready to send to <name>Nashville</name> at any time. I am informed that the first stand of arms <orig reg="brought">brot</orig> to this <abbr expan="county">co</abbr> was 22 or 3 years since__ They were drawn for the use of a volunteer company, and used by them, some 6 years; at the expiration of which time, the company and muskets were pretty well wornout The captain who commanded the company has been since lied, and but few of the <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> Now remain in this county The 2nd stand of Arms but to this county was in 1837 or 8_ They were brought to this County, for the use of another volunteer Company which was organizing here__ Ex_ Gov. <name>Cannon</name> was then in this <unclear>place,</unclear> and authorized the Company to send <add>to</add> <name>Nashville</name> and yet a stand of Arms which was done. About that time, the <name>Texas</name> was Commenced, and some of the Company left for the seat of war, Camping with them some 8 or 10 of the Muskets__ and I have been in formed that they used them to a great advantage in <orig reg="massacring">massacreeing</orig> the Mexicans. The first stand of  Musket are nearly all worn out or lost. The last stand is in a tolerable fair condition <add>considering</add> what they have been through. I had them in my possession, or partly so, until the presidential Election in 1844 when I gave them up to the Democrats, and they were used by them during the Presidential Canvass of that year. Ex_ Gov. Brown <orig reg="referred">refered</orig> me, in his letter, to the act of 1845-6, pages 291 <abbr expan="and">n</abbr> 292. I presume that it is expedient <pb n="[2]"/> for you to take some action <del type="overstrike">with</del> upon the subject They can be repaired in the Penitentiary without Call to the state. I find it a hard matter to keep them together &amp; the sooner they are removed the better. It was the intent of Ex Gov <abbr expan="Brown">B.</abbr> to have them all Collected and <abbr expan="returned">retd</abbr> to Nashville. I should be pleased to hear from you upon the subject. I can refer you to <add>the</add>respectable portion of the community here for the Correctness of my statements____</p>
