			 <note type="summary">This is a letter to Governor Willie Blount from H.L. White, dated July 26, 1815. White is the president of the state bank in Knoxville. The letter refers to the banking policy of suspending payments in specie, as a result of the financial strain of the War of 1812. White writes that his bank has decided to follow the suspension, as to not would cause the bank to call in too many loans, thereby putting too much financial strain on the local community. The letter contains a brief summary of the political, martial, and financial situation in the U.S. and Europe as explanation for the change in policy.</note>
