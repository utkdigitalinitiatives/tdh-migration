He is explaining that he does not know how long the term of service for a local detachment of men  is supposed to be. He also regrets the lack of supplies for the soldiers.  Much of the letter discusses the movements of Creek, Choctaw, and Chickasaw forces; and of various US military generals and colonels.</note><note type="collection">John Cocke Papers V-J-3</note><note type="box">n/a</note><note type="folder">F:8</note><note type="document">sl136</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Military supplies</item><item>Military planning</item><item>Cherokee Indians</item><item>Creek Indians -- Wars</item><item>Choctaw Indians</item><item>Southern States</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine><name type="place">Baxter Grove</name>. <date value="1813-12-07"><abbr expan="December">Dec.</abbr> 7th 1813</date>.</addrLine></address><salute>Dear Sir;</salute></opener><p>I have just <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> yours of the 3rd <abbr expan="Instant">Inst.</abbr> &amp; now acknowledge the receipt of one of a prior date respecting the term of service of the detached Militia, &amp; again inform you that I answered, by <name type="person"><abbr expan="Major">Majr.</abbr> Scarcy</name> , before I left <name type="place">Nashville</name> yours respecting the term of service of the volunteers, which I presume you have <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> before this: as also <name type="person"><abbr expan="Major">Majr.</abbr> Scarcy</name>on the subject of   <name type="person">Mr Hickman</name>'s  become sutler to your Army, who was to have left <name type="place">Nashville</name> with <unclear>shoes</unclear> ten days ago. &mdash; were I  beyond a doubt <abbr expan="satisfied">satisfy'd</abbr> that on the 10th <abbr expan="Instant">Inst.</abbr> the volunteers term of service was actually to expire, I have not the authority to order their discharge or to supply their places  &mdash; These two points rest <orig reg="solely">soley</orig> with the President to do or order to be done; hence I could not take upon myself such responsibility.
