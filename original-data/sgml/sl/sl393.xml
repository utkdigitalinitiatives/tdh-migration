I must send it in small sums for fear of loss.  I have in all now sent you $35.  three fives &amp; two tens.  and will in a day or two start more.  I wish would try &amp; get old friend Julin to do as much work any how as will come to the $65.  he owes me for the horse.  and when  that much is done.  I shall not be in a Hurry about <pb n="[2]"/> the balance since I have been here when sitting alone thinking about you all  I have thoughts of various plans for our future settlement.    and my best conclusion was to fix up the Two places and either rent or sell them and get a farm not more than a mile from town where we could reuse stack <abbr expan="and et cetera">&amp;c</abbr>. I shall be able to <unclear>hire</unclear> hands enough to cultivate it I think a mile or 3 quarters from Town would be preferable to a residence at either of our places, however we will talk all this over sitting by the fire with each of us a pipe in our mouth when I get Home for I am resolved  my next move shall be permanent therefore I think we had better have 150 or 200 acres of good land where we can raise hogs, cows, &amp; chickens Ducks geese <abbr expan="etcetera">&amp;C</abbr> and then we  wont want money to buy corn <abbr expan="etcetera">&amp;C</abbr> You may depend I am saving here,  except that I wear as fine clothes as any man in congress and  that I dont count extravagance.  I have been telling you in my letters of my steady &amp; sober habits and I tell you now it is all true.  I dont believe there is a man in either branch of congress   more regular than myself except Benton of <name>Missouri</name> who is one of the most Laborious  men in America our acquaintance C. Johnson <orig reg="though">tho</orig> not a dissipated man is far from a man of research <pb n="[3]"/> he stands well here is a clever fellow but his position as a man of talent is far from invincible the fact is he can never make any figure here  tho this is his third session he seems to have reconciled himself to <orig reg="move">moove</orig> along smoothly how we are deceived at Home as to the standing of men here.  <name>James K Polk</name> is evidently the most efficient &amp; respectable member from our state.  tho keep all this to yourself.  I dont know what to think of my old friend C. <unclear>Boyle</unclear>, I have written to him several times but have received no answer.  tho I find he writes to Johnson I wrote a letter or two to Moran and forgot then one time to write to him as they hate each other perhaps he did not like this. but the fact is I care not whether he likes it or not. I<abbr expan="received"> recd</abbr> a letter to day from our old friend <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Caudle he and family were well.  Be in good spirits the time glides on pretty fast and I am not only going in a pecuniary point but I am availing myself of every chance of information I am searching into all the observations of government of which I knew less than I supposed the fact is it takes constant application if a man ever expects to make any figure here and as I have resolved to speak to no subject <pb n="[4]"/> unless it be one of importance and not be that <orig reg="until">untill</orig> I am well acquainted with it. it behooves  me to be industrious. many men of good mind render themselves ridiculous here by entering on debate with <add>out</add> knowing what they are talking about it is the rock on which many <unclear>split</unclear> they become dissatisfied with themselves and surrender themselves to dissipation.  my brother wrote me that his son Will was the largest build of his size he ever saw that he was very much like me with many other particulars of his family which I this moment remember <gap reason="hole in document"/> wrote to you about before so I will stop  I write to <unclear>you</unclear> so often I expect I shall repeat the same story often however  as the Vicar of Wakefield says a good story cannot be told too often</p> <closer><abbr expan="Yours">Yrs</abbr> Affectionately <signed>W Fitzgerald</signed></closer></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
