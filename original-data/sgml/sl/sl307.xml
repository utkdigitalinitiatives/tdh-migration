He also writes of the state of Mrs. Kezia McCarroll's claim, and of trying to get information on other people that Fergusson has written to him about. Campbell also bemoans a resolution proposed in the House to not fund a National Bank.</note><note type="collection">Fergusson Papers</note><note type="box"> IV-G-1 b2</note><note type="folder">10</note><note type="document">sl307</note></bibl></sourceDesc></fileDesc><encodingDesc><projectDesc><p>Created for the University of Tennessee Digital Library</p></projectDesc><editorialDecl><p>Quotation marks retained as data except inside q tags</p><p>Errors in transcription of the printed text controlled with X-Metal 2.1 spell-checker; text has also been thoroughly proofread.</p><p>Corrections and normalization represented by editorial tags.</p><p>All unambiguous end-of-line hyphens removed.</p><p>Catchwords and directional notes such as "turn page over" have been omitted.</p></editorialDecl><refsDecl><p>ID attributes provided for only those pages, chapters, or illustrations toward which a reference or figure points.</p></refsDecl><classDecl><taxonomy><bibl><title>Library of Congress Subject Headings</title></bibl></taxonomy></classDecl></encodingDesc><profileDesc><textClass><keywords><list><item>Letters</item><item>War pensions</item><item>Tennessee -- Politics and government -- To 1865</item></list></keywords></textClass></profileDesc></teiHeader><text><body><div1 type="letter"><pb n="[1]"/><opener><address><addrLine>House of Representatives</addrLine><addrLine><name type="place">Washington</name> <date value="1837-10-05"><abbr expan="October">Oct</abbr> 5. 1837</date></addrLine></address><salute>Sir,</salute></opener><p>I have received your letter and have delayed an answer for the purpose of obtaining the information you requested.</p><p>As to the claim of <name type="person">Mr Fair</name>, nothing can be done until the regular session, a law will  have to be passed for his special benefit to enable him to get his pension for the time that he was dropped or stricken from the pension roll and this congress determined early in the session that they would entertain no business except that which touches the recommendations in the Presidents message, This was against my wishes, but I assure you that nothing can be done until the regular session, at which time I will use every endeavor to have a law passed to <unclear>remunerate</unclear> him for his lost time It will be necessary to take <del type="overstrike">the</del> evidence to show that Mr Fair was improperly <orig reg="dropped">droped</orig> by <pb n="[2]"/> the commissioner of Pensions. the case will be <orig reg="referred">refered</orig> to the committee on claims, and if it is sufficiently made out to receive a <orig reg="favorable">favourable</orig> report from that committee I doubt not but that the law can be passed.</p><p>As to the claim of  Mrs.<name type="person"> Kezia Mc Carroll</name> I have not been able to obtain any information, which will be of service to her  claim.
