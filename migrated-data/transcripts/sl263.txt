Nashville June 24th 1850 My own My Dearest George It is a week to day since I received your precious letter from Florence ; you have written to Mr McClelland once , by which means I heard you ever well; which was truly grattifying gratifying to your own devoted Mary, altho although the letter was not to herself — I dream of you every night, and two nights ago, I had a long, long, and disagreeable one about your being sick, I thought you had been sick for three long weeks, and you would not let me know one word of it that I might have flown to your bed side and nursed you tenderly, and faithfully (as a ⁁ loving wife only can) through it M — I can assure you, I was in deep trouble I also dreamed that Tom was dead, and Toby was missing, eather either dead, or run off, I couldn't decide which — But I will say no more of this horrible dream; and hope it may go as " Rory Omore " say, by contraries my dear" We are all well yet, and God grant this blissing blessing may continue until you return at least, Mrs Fowler and her family

went out to Mr Greenfrel s yesterday, but I suppose they will be in, in a few days Mortey Em and the whole "Ships Crew" spent the day with us, together with Jo, cousin Will, and Mr Burksdale , notwithstanding, all this, J was lonely indeed Lou was to have been examined to day (monday) but Mr Burksdale concluded he had better hurry through with his business and go home to day, which rejoiced Lou very much as it released her from the examination. She with her father, Miss Loucey Bailey , and several others, from Clarksville , left for home this morning, at 11 oclock You will doubtless see from the papers, before you receive this letter, that our city has again been visited with Cholera. It is true there is some Cholera here but as last year, it is confined principally to that portion of the city south of Broadstreet — I received a long letter from aunt Hamilton on saturday. It was directed to both of us, she requests me, if you, are absent to answer it, which I will do in a few days, She say she confidently expects a visit from you and I by the first of August at farthest, Since you left I have

Bilbo arived here yesterday, and Mr McClelland say the report about town is, that Bilbo say, he has more money than he knows what to do with; and he wants to see House , and person Pitts to get rid of it, I give you the report just as I heard it; Mr Mc Mr McClelland has not seen him yet, You have not said any thing about Crops' since you left, wheather whether or not the droughth drought has extended south of this, You were so near your Mother at Freanna that I think it strange you did not visit her, but you certainly, will on your return I have heard of the death of Lucy Haughton 's sister Mrs Binford , not heard a word from Tommey, or Loucy, since you went away — Sallie say I must not close my letter without
