Hartsville 10th March 1845 My Dear Sir. You can see from the editorial of the last Gallatin Union that our democratic friends will have a convention, not only to nominate candidates for the lower house but also for the higher officers â€” I was told last evening that Capt Captain R A Bennett had written out his declension and was ready to Submit his claims to the convention. This is as it should be. Men should waite wait till public sentiment settles down in their favor before they become candidates for the law making power. I wish to make a few suggestions thro through , you to some of our friends. 1st do not understand me that I wish to run for Senate or Congress_ for my business & situation of my family for bids forbids that I should be absent long enough to take such a canvas 2nd I think Smith County should take the lead in selecting a man. If Dr Doctor Robinson will not run, Col Colonel Guild has as much management in conducting a canvas as any one we can start. Boddie is more popular in Smith but his health forbids his running. His manner suits the occasion better than Guilds. Dr Robinson can get the Democratic vote of this county. Had you not better have a convention before we do. 3rdly _ We ought not to nominate a candidate for Congress. We are in the minority and on a fair ma t ch race cant succeed. Had we not better turn that matter over to Davidson . Let Peyton & McDonald contend who shall sit on the nest till

they roll some of the eggs (votes) out to be used by the democrats. It has been my anxious wish that the whigs, in their confidence, should start a multiplicity of candidates for senate & congress _ (and while I was making some advances towards accomplishing this object som mean democrats, about here susspecting suspecting from my addresses that my object was against them, or that they could cull from my correspondence something to injure me with in this county, sent the immotal immotile Bennett to Carthage for copies &c &c and et cetera, and et cetera ) while they were busy at home misrepresenting my cause & impugning my motives _ I wish you & our friends to consider _ of this matter & whatever conclusions you come to, apprise Gaskin of the G Gallatin Union,. We wish to act in concert with Smith County in Senatorial & Congressional nominations. If you have any efficient debaters in Smith County of good standing that can carry a few hundred whig votes, he is the man for the Senate. Write me as soon as convenient Your friend Jas. James S. Dyer A Fergusson Esqr Esquire
