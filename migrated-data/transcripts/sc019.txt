Nashville July 29, 1844 Dr Dear Sir I requested Mr. Ficklin the other day to send you an invitation to our mass meeting on the 15 August next. But I wish to be more special. Come by all means and spend a day or two with the old Genl. General Our people here wish to see you and to hear you on the stump. You can say something about Mr. Clay better than any one anyone else, and what you say will tell before the audience that will be here. Your election will be over, and you will have done all that you can at home Come give us a lift here, and bring Bullock and other young men who like to speak in a good cause. Yr Your Friend A J Andrew Jackson Donelson Genl General John McCalla
