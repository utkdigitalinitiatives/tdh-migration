Lexington Feb February 13th 1839 My Dear Father Your letter of the Third of February was received to day. It gave me great pleasure to learn, that you all were in The enjoyment of a reasonable proportion of health. You Complain a little of my not writing oftener; and more especially of not directing my Correspondence to yourself and Ma— And I really think you have good reasons for dissatisfaction; but I trust you will not cherish for a moment the erroneous idea, or do me the great injustice, to suppose that my silence towards you has originated from a want of that filial affection which every Son should possess for his Father; and particularly one who has been so kind benevolent and indulging as you have towards me. Nothing would be more mortifying to me than for you to suppose that I am destitute of the warmest affection and regard for you. I therefore hope you will pardon my negligence in not writing and receive This as an humble tribute of my love and affection, and in future ascribe my diffidence to a cause more

Congenial with my feelings. In your letter you desired me to inform you in what way I expected to return home. I had expected to go by water before I received a letter from William about Two weeks since, In which he informed me that Richard expected to start to Phila Philadelphia about the Fifteenth of this month, and that he would, or expected, to ride a horse as far as Lexington or Maysville , and Then leave him; and If I thought proper I Could ride The horse home. I was pleased with The arrangement; and wrote him That I wished him to do so. I wrote to him The 1st day of This month and have no doubt by This time he has received The letter. If he does not start before you receive This and he Concludes to come this way, I wish him to bring my over Shoes and wrappers and to bring a large pair of saddle Bags. If he does not Conclude to ride a horse This way I prefer going home by water to your sending me a horse.— The report I have to make in regard to The state of my funds is not very favourable favorable . I had expected I would have a sufficiency but I find That I shall have to ask of you The remittence of about Thirty Dollars. It will require about

Thirty Dolls Dollars to answer my purpose. I expect to leave here between The Tenth and Fifteenth of March. The Lectures are beginning to drag very heavy indeed I am so much worn out, together with anxiety of mind That I do not expect to be benefitted from This forward. If Richard does not leave before you receive This I would like to ⁁ hear immediately whether he ⁁ me This way or not If he should come bring me The money with him. If not Confer me a favour favour by remitting amount immediately. — Your affectionate Son James L. Alexander P.S. Give my love to Ma Aunt Franky and enquiring Friends JLA James L. Alexander
