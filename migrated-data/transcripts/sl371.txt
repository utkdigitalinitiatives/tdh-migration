Tallahassee Octr October 26th 1835 My Dear Brother Meeting with Col. Colonel Butler in the streets of Tallahassee today, he accosted me thus, when did you hear from your Brother? my reply was, some days ago- I saw from his manner that he had something which he considered important to communicate, pausing but for a moment he expressed himself thus: I fear your Brother will in the course of the winter be engaged in an unpleasant affair. With whom Bell, was my reply? no. Barrow-he then proceeded to say that you had gotten a friend in Ten. Tennessee to call on Mr. Barrow to know when he would be out of the limits of the State of Ten. and as a reason for the enquiry the laws of the State; he stated that he understood to what allusion was made, and that he would or expected to spend a month or

Let me hear how you forthwith on the reception of this- you can imagine my anxiety of mind. Genl. D. General Daniel S Donelson ansd. answered 7 Nov. November 1833 - Andrew J. Jackson Donelson Esq.
