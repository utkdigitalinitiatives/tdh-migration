Dear Sir Genl General Jackson and myself purchas the chickasaw Bluff track about the year 1796__ I have retained my part of it ever since. I never knew and in what manner the Genl disposed of his part__ Latterly I have inquired of him, and he tells me that he never made Saml Samuel Donelson a deed as he believes, as Saml Donelson was in debt to him, nor did he ever make any contract to that effect, that he recollects, Hence it seems clear that you and the heirs your Brother William have only one eighth of the interest in the chickasaw Bl tract of 5000 acres, that I own one of which there is no dispute that you, and the heirs of your brother William half only an eighth of the interest in the chickasaw Bluff tract of 5000 acres_ that I own one half, of which there is no dispute__ that you

of William Winchester, and Jackson, each eighth part & Jackson a fourth___ It is very important that something ould be done as quick as possible, in relation to the laying off a town at the Bluff, as towns are now the fashion, and other sites above may come in competition with it. I would therefore recommend, that you immediately appraise your relations, the heirs of Mr William Winchester of the importance of uniting our views __ that they will constitute an agent here to act for them, making provision for the death of such agent; so that the purchases of lots may not be injured or subject to injury. They should give a power of attorney, authorising authorizing A.B. to unite making deeds for town lots__ that death as to of the heirs shall not annul the power; and case of the death of the said A.B. then shall succeed; and in case of his death, D. shall succeed , and have all the powers and authorities of the said A.B. the attorney originally appointed. In this way, no injury will arise to purchasers of lots, by the death of any of those interested in the land__ which so frequently produces

injury, and discourages purchasing town rest of the proprietors viz videlicet Overton, J James winchester, Jackson, will do the land they, viz: vest similar powers in the same person or persons, to make deeds in case of death._ I beg that you will communicate these things to the heirs of William Winchester as quick as possible; if they do not think proper to join in laying off the town, we will apply to the court, and get a partition made, setting aside the part to itself; and winchester, Jackson and Overton will proceed to lay off a town on the part laid off, and set a part to them. This not being the interest of the heirs of Wm William Winchester, I expect they will unite with us, and lend out the necessary p to lay off said town, constituting an agent, agents, in case of death, and with a provis garcessly , that death in any of the partes conce shall not annul said power. I am Resply respectfully yr m ob s your most obedient servant J John W Overton Genl Winchester
