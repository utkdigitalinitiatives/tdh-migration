she began to feed her she is better, and is thriving Jo — was at a party, here that we gave to Mr, Carry , and at Mr, Nichols , and staid tell stayed till twelve oclock o'clock and the babe slept all the time, last night it had a crying spell, and this morning she gave her some oil, which griped it Sarah , was there and she said it cryed cried very much, but I hope it will be better after the oil, Adin and I drank tea with Maria Price while she was in town, and she told me how much opposed you were to Josephs going to, North, Carolina , Mr. Woods was exceedingly sorry that you did not talk to him on that subject before you left, as he was several times told you his plans, and beside he had made every arrangement fer arrangement for his going, and was in correspondence with some of the teachers, he has however, concluded, only on your account, to send him one session to, Mr, Hume as he has several vacancies the next term, if he dose does well, he may continue him longer, but I fear, he has been so in the habit of not going to school half his time, that it will difficult for him to confine himself as he will have to do, with, Mr, Hume, for he tells Mr, Woods, that he gives an account of every day he is not there, and every bad lesson he has, you had better write to Jo, and tell him, that his, Uncle, well will be compelled to send him away, if he will not learn at home, Maria Price intends taking him to live with her, and I have no doubt, will do by him all you could wish, if he will submit to her desire and council, Mrs McCay , is here from, St, Louis is rather
