Nashville November 20th 1839 My Dearest Cousin Jane As I have finished writing my fifth lesson for the morning and have a few leisure minutes, I thought I could employ them very agreeably indeed by answering your most affectionate epistle, which was handed to me a quarter of an hour ago by Uncle Crutcher and for it I must offer my most cordial thanks, for your punctuality in writing so soon, after the reception of mine, and now to commence will inform you that your friends are all enjoying good health I saw your Father, Mother, and sisters, at church last Sabbath, but did not have an opportunity of speaking to them What has become of Jim? I have not seen anything of him in a Coons age. I expect he has gone south, as he told me the last time that I had any conversation with him (which was a day or two before Uncle Gusten left that he expected to go to New Orleans with his uncle, and I expect he has gone. Nashville is tolerable gay at this time. There has been several large parties lately, and a few weddings. Miss Eliza Moffis

and Mr. Mister Budd are married at last, after so long engagement. His mother was very much opposed to their marrying, and she went down to Mrs Misses John T Hills, and was married by the Reverend Mr Howell. Mr Moffis is here at this time, but intends leaving with his family in a few days for Texas . We had a run away match from the Academy on the same night. The girls name was Miss mcDaniel, but I do not recollect the gentleman's name. he was Carpenter by trade, and he name should have been "Sally Brown," as I suppose you have heard of a song by that name. There were two deaths in town last week, which occasioned a great deal of regret. They were both young gentleman, Mr Elk Brown , and Mr Goodish Mr Burn's faunt aide in Philadelphia , and he had only been here a year or two. Our examination commences the 9th of December, and continues four days. There will only be two graduates, Eliza Janie Brambett , and myself, I am very busy indeed preparing my studies, as we have a great many to be examined on. I declare I never was so busy in all my life. Besides my studies I have several very difficult pieces to play on the Piano, and I have just taken them, and therefore they will require a great deal of practice, in order to be played as they should be. Our school is very large this session; there are at present two hundred, and twenty pupil. Martha Anderson , and Marion Cannon have returned to school, and Maria Richmond , (that went to school with you at Dr Berry's is also here. She desires to

be remembered very affectionately to you. I will return home immediately after the examination class, and I will not return anymore to this school as I will receive my sheepskin. But evening draws on and admonishes me to close my letter. Give my best love to Ann, and tell her I will be very glad if she will comply with her promise. Remember me also to Marg Lewis , and when you see her, and Martha Fubue , and Ann Overton . Your dearest Cousin Sarah Bet NB. Please answer this letter, and direct it to Pulaski , as I will leave Nashville before that can reach here
