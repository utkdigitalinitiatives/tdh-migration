Nashville Sept. September 4 1844 My dearest wife, The can of time moves slowly along in your absence and we are again in the midst of dust and warm weather — Mosquitoes plentiful and our city dull and healthy — I am growing more and more weary at your absence — indeed my sweet mates — I verily believe that you are really a part and parcel of me — at least, I could not be happy long without you — There is an indefinable something which enforces the thought that we are one — Then how painful to be absent, a moment from our real self — I long too, to see our little ones — I have conjured up a thousand times in my mind how Sally looks, and how much changed she will be when I see her — I shall leave for Alaba Alabama the very moment — I have a settlement with Mr Bennett who is yet absent, and will not be at home for some two or three weeks — or perhaps not before this time next month — he is going up the Arkansas river, and if the waters are low he will be detained — I am growing very anxious for the time to arrive when I shall once again fold you and our jewels to my bosom — In a few more days you will have been absent two months — and our girl will be four months old — bless her sweetness —

I sent the bundle from Mother to you and sister Nancy by Mr Saml Samuel Coltart of Huntsville a week ago — and I hope you have received it safely — I send you yesterdays paper — and marked an article on wool — which I wish you to show to brother, and ask him ⁁ if it would not be more profitable for him to grow wool than cotton — he has some swamp land by taking out the under-growth would make splendid pasture — and a sheep will ⁁ live on very little — Mark Cookrell in this neighborhood in making his thousands by raising wool — I will ask your particular attention also — to two letters in said paper, one from Genl General Jackson and the other from H Henry Clay — and contrast the difference Genl Jackson 's is the most ridiculous thing I ever read The Beans and Russells to whom it is addressed are said to be the vainest scamps on the globe — it will tell well for the good and righteous cause of Whigery Tis the opinion of some of the knowing ones here, that Mr Clay will beat Polk in this state from 7 to 10 thousand votes — Bets are offered here — that Mr Clays majority in Ky Kentucky and Ohio will be greater than all Polks majorities combined throughout the U.S. United States — Tell sister I am glad she has written to Ann on the subject of politicks politics — as she says she will quit them — I would also most respectfully suggest that she (sister) should write to Ann in regard to her going to Sunday School and Church — she (Ann) is very stubborn about going to either —

a letter from sister commanding her to attend punctually would be of the greatest service — and therefore should be attended to — Ann loves her Mother — and will receive counsel from her — but she does not like to receive it from any one else — I took tea at Mr. Greenfields on Monday night, he has his house full — Mr and Mrs Fowler have got back there — Mr Fowler expects to go upon the river again this winter, as Commander of a Boat — Martha Jane Price received a letter from Sigs Taylor a few days ago — she is in Virginia , and says she and Doct Doctor Oscar are to be married in October — Oscar has not written a syllable to any of us since you left — Miss Dunn — Mr Scords old flame — was married on Monday night to a Mr Blocker of Mobile Alaba Alabama and Miss Lateba Hagan and a Mr McCrary from Miss. Mississippi are to be spliced on tomorrow night — I have not heard anything from Fort for several days — He is I suppose in a state of despondency — poor fellow, I pity him — but my compassion will not avail him anything — Miss K — is certainly entitled to the character of fickleness — If I had such a wife — I should be like old Mr Browns man about the bonnets— I should be afraid before I could gratify any wish, she would have changed her mind— A Miss Grun at the academy is quite sick — and Mortimer was complaining yesterday — but he took some of my pills last night and is better to day — The balance of us are well — I got a letter from Burk a few days since he desires to be remembered to you —
