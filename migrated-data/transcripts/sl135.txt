HighwasseeHiwassee Garrison30th September 1813SirIt was contemplated by me in  the orgenizationorganization of the Cherokees who volantier therevolunteer their  service against the Creeks to have them formed to Companies & BattallionsBattalion property Officers by their own people  in all the grades of Officers, so far as to enclude that of majors and that then the whole should be commanded & lead by a  Citizen of the United States whose experience in Indian warfare would qualify him for such a Command. Such Character I presumed might be formed without having any one individual in my mind. The above arrangement I preeviouslypreviously stated to the secretary of war who in answer to my letter made no observation relating to such an organization.  I concluded that he could not do otherwise than approve of it —The proposition of the Governor in favor of Judge Cocke to lead the Cherokees in the expedition now beginning its movement is perfectly agreeable to me — and I will endeavor to make it agreeable to the Young Cherokee Officers who will bring forward their young men for the Campaign.I have the honor to be with great respectyr. obt.your obedient ServantReturn J.
