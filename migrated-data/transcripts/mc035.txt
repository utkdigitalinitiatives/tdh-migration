Steam Boat Champion 22nd July 1846 Dear Pa, When I left Knoxville, I fully intended to come thro through Murfreesboro & expected then to march my company thro through there, but I could not, & regretted it very much. Upon our arrival at Memphis, the election of field officers took place in a few days & I was so simple as to be a candidate for Lieut. Col. Lieutenant Colonel against what I am persuad persuade was a combination— I have been repeatedly told since, that if the election had been delayed ten days I could have beat any man in the regiment for Col.

Give my love to Ma & all the family Tell Ben & Phil and Mr. Hord to write to me, to Matamoras — " Captain— Tennessee Cavalry." Yours Affectionately Wm. R. William Richard Caswell
