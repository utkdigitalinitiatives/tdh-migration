West Point My Dear Brother Excuse me for not writing sooner, for I have been so busy and so vexed of late that I was afraid I would say something to displease you or Mother but I can write now more to please than I may be again for a week or ten day. I will try and put a few sentences together without offending or annoying any one. My health is only tolerable, as the we ⁁ ther weather is cold and damp. Yesterday I had a very severe headache but I feel some what better today. I am very glad to see the young people of Florence so fortunate as to meet with each other and to please and to be pleased & to marry it shows a happy and peacefull peaceful community when so much gayety and galantry gallantry is going on, may they live long and be happy in each others love is your humble servants prayer. I understand that our town is receiving other benefits besides the matrimonial ones, she will soon be a large and beautiful city. You have heard no doubt before this of the rascally set of resolutions the Legislature of Vermont sent the United States Senate, with a petition as long is my arm praying that slavery be prohibited, and a thousand other things too foolish to mention The most vilainous villainous thing that could be done, and will at length bring evil war among us. I wish all of them had their necks stretched and it depended on me to save them or not

The Canadians are making strong headway a good many of the Citizens near the line have gone over and help them and I understand that several regiments have gone over with plenty arms and Stores if it is so may have dif ⁁ culty difficulty with England , perhaps a severe war. From the present prospects I think we bid fair to have a war some where before two years either amongst ourselves or with some foreign power, and the Senate is still squibling squibbling away. I have no particular news, The winter has been uncommonly mild, generally but for the last few days it has been geting getting colder every day and until the first of March. I expect to see very little pleasant weather; There is large quantities of ice in the river, but it has not frozen over, it is expected it will tonight. I would like to take a hunt now, if it were possible, with a good pack of hounds a good day, a good gun and you to drive, then if I did not kill a deer, God help me , I am very glad to hear you are making a good crop of coton cotton , and I Sincerely wish you may make a better one next year If I should ever come home I will keep you to your promise to present me with Old John or Limble Jim Maybe I may write you a more interesting letter the next time, provide you do the same. My love to all friends & Relations Your Brother A J Andrew Jackson Coffee Give my Repects Respects to Mr & Mrs Hightower , "I congratulate them". AJC Andrew Jackson Coffee
