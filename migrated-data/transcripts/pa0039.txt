Cherokee agency 4th May 1818 Sir pursuant to a request from the Honl. Honorable John C Calhoun Secretary of War. First to settle your compensation as commissioner for valuing Cherokee improvements. I propose that you receive Five Dollars for each and every day you are actually engaged in discharging the duties of your office, and a like sum for every thirty miles Travling Traveling to the place of beginning. and the same for every thirty miles travling home from the place where you may close your business. I propose this as being the allowance made by the Legislature of the state of Tennessee, to her commissioners for similar services, which will be paid to you by orders of the Secretary of War. article 6th provides that the Rifles, &c et cetera stipulated to be given to the poor warriors shall be in full consideration for the improvements they may leave. and to those emigrants who is whose improvements add real value to the land, the U.States are to pay a full valuation which expression will be construded construed by some as imposing upon you the duty of making a very liberal allowance, to suppress such an Idea amongst the claimants where rigid Justice alone must govern. It could not be unjust to keep in view, and even to suggest where such insinuation were made, that those clamants claimants had recevied received the preecise precise amount-

amount, in Rifles, Boats, Blankets, &c, that had follen fallen to the lot of the poor warriors, with regard to the number of improvements which have been estimated as adding real value to the Land, I have never heard of any clame , except by Mr. John Rogers Jr. and Majr. Major John Jolly , nor have I any reason to believe there are any others which have been surendered surrendered within the last six months. I submit for your information the following estimate which will exhibit the amount paid by the U. States for the removel removal of each Indian famely family , consisting of four persons as the avreage average number thereof. which sum may fairly be istimated estimated (and so expressed by you where it becomes necessary) as the current price actully actually paid for each emigrants improvements including both rich and poor warriors, which on principles of General calculation will far exceed there their real value.
