Columbia Tennessee Decr. December 19th 40 My dear Sister This being Saturday, and as I have concluded that you do not intend writing to your poor Sister who is far away from you. I will write to you. I know that I would not have treated you as you have treated me. but I will forgive you if you will promise to be a better correspondent hereafter. If you know how much pleasure it gave me to receive your letter, I know that you would write to me again. Mother wrote me three or four weeks ago saying that ⁁ both you and brother John intended writing that week to me, but I expect that you have forgotten me by this time. Sister please anser answer this letter as soon as you receive it, it would releive relieve my mind to see that you have not forgotten me. You cannot imagine ⁁ how much disappointed I was to hear that Aunt Narcissa was not comming coming up to see me, but I was as much delighted to hear that Papa was coming up. I wondor wonder how I shall spend my Christmas the first one that I ever spent from home. You will all be so happy at home the very name of home makes me feel happy. I never knew how much I loved you all until I left home. There is no place like home according to my oppinion opinion . Sis Sister I am affraid afraid that you cannot read this printed letter for it is the first one that I ever trid tried to print. You must excuse me for not writing a longer letter for I have not time to write more.

O Oh ! it is so cold here. It is a great deal colder than in Jackson. I expect that I feel the cold more sensibly than if I was at home, for there are 40 odd girls, and only two fire places. You know that is not enough for us all to get by. I am so glad that you are not here this Winter on that account. I know that you would freeze. but I do want to so you so much. I know if was at home I would never speak an unkind word to you. Give my love to Mama & Papa & all the children. Aunt N. Aunt P. & all my Uncles & Aunts & Cousins. I remain your most affectionate Sister M. J. Mary Jane Chester Miss Martha Butler Chester
