To his Excellency Samuel Houston Governor of Tennessee The undersigned beg leave to call your attention to the subject of settling the state boundary line in that part that separates stuart , & Trigg counties as the Legislature of Kentucky hath passed a resolution on that subject, and as you will be called on by the Execution of that state to cooperate with him in that business, we with due deference would suggest the following remarks, That owing to a line found having the appearance of Walker's marks. Extending from two miles East of Cumberland to the Tennessee River about two miles north and unconnected with the line run by Walker. as directed by the Government of virginia from the Southeast corner of the State of Kentucky which refuted line hath been a source of much perplexity growin growing out of the excessive power by the officers of both states over a few inhabitants over which each claim jurisdiction that the Territory is small Say 18 or 20 square miles which we presume of too little magnitude to be regarded as an object with either state or Counties & ajoining adjoining and we suppose the Legislature of Kentucky noted the subject with a special view to the relief of us that is aquired acquired and as we are unable to perceive how surveyors that may be appointed by the chief majestry of the two states__ with the article of Stipulation of the 11th of February 1820 entered into by the

commissioners appointed by both States before them can connect those lines without doing violence to other parts of the compact we would further remark that whether those marks north of walkers general line were made by walker and little to the purpose walker work out to be a strait line extending to the Tennessee River this would give uniformity to the boundary between the two states and tranquility to the people immediately interested, with this view of the Subject we would respectfully submit, the following (viz) that in your correspondence with the Executive of Kentucky you permit him by his surveyor or surveyors to remark and settle walkers line from the South east corner of Trigg County to the Tennessee River, and where no marks can be found that he shall be governed by the course of Said line. We believe this would be in strict conformity with the expectation & praise worthy spirit in which the stipulation was made We tender these remarks with feelings & views congenial with that vital self governing principle that so eminently adorns our system of government Names Names 1 Sam his mark L Sells Herman J Downs John J Acree Wm William C Jones Joshua Sheelan Elisha M Hain Robert Hamletten Thomas B Powell Charles hamlleton David Charhill James Charhill Thos.
