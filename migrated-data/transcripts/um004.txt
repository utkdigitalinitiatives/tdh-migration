Washington May 29th 1833 My Dear Mary, Your kind & very interesting letter of the 29th of April was duly received and has remained without answer until now, with barely an acknowledgment of its receipt, in my letter to your dear father. To you my dear Mary, who know how little time is permitted to me for friendship, my delay in not answering requires no apology, but I should have snatched a moment from my constant public demand, but I have been much indisposed since you left us, and more than usual pressed with public concerns. My mind has been constantly filled with anxiety with regard to your fathers health— My enquiries are unceasing, and I have been indebted to Major Lewis , at Nashville for ⁁ the only information lately received, and that was consoling, as it was from Doctor Hagg , and gave us assurance of his ⁁ speedy restoration to perfect health, for which my prayers have been, & are unceasing. In my letter to which you allude I did complain of you & Mary McLourones' neglect in not writing me-you have both leisure and when you reflect how much interest I feel in your, & your respective families

welfare, it must occur to you how much pleasure I feel on the receipt of a letter from any branch of either, giving me intelligence of their health happiness & prosperity. Therefore it was that I enjoined on you both to write me, believing you had not only leisure, but despositions dispositions . I have been much gratified by one from you, but Mary McLourone, has, as yet been silent, from you I have the promise that you will be a better correspondent for the future. I can only add how much pleasure it will afford me at all times to receive a letter from you, and I am sure you would write often, if your really knew how much I have your happiness & that of every branch of your dear family at heart. I have said my health has been bad since you left us, it is better, & I will soon travel to the cost coast to try to improve it. This, this is doubtful whether the fatigue of the journey, & the crowds of people thro through which I have to pass may not prove more in injurious to my health, than the benefit ensuing from change of air & climate My health & life is in the hands of my creator, in him will I trust, & freely resign to his will—our great duty my dear Mary, is to live, & in our lives to learn how to die & ensure our happiness beyond the grave.
