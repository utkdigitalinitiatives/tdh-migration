If you come in the way Father and me was talking about which I am in hopes you will be able to dwo do there will be no chance to bring any Chairs I dont do not racon reckon upon the event it should be conveneint convenient to slip one ore two in the carriage duo so as I wood would feel more independant independent in the shop if I had some though that is a small matter and I can get them here, and dwo do no want you come in and them coresponds corresponds . Tell the Friend who may bring you that the best Rout after he leaves Alexandria will be to come or go around by w Water's Mill and thense thence down said creek (Round lick) to Saulsbury the best Rout which is not more than 2, or 3 miles farther than through the hills and five times as good a rout.

I forgot to leave you any money the morning I left tell Father, that I want him to let you have what you want, and also tell him that I am depending on him to change my Journal to Commerce Wilson Cty. Tenn. County Tennessee and out of monies collected to pay John T. S. Fall — College Street — Ben Franklin office, and as he has my bill from Evin $35.08 with a recipt receipt $32. he is well prepared to tell the gentleman how the matter stands, and settle that also if convenient and if not it dont do not matter for Evin received 40 or 50 dollars from me and I expect would not be looser if he waited several years for the money — if William Gilly George Grizzle nor any of the Ballance Balance will pay in send me word how the matter is driving. For I must pay Fall before long. If you see Ezekial Watson as you come through Alexandria dun him for $12.50 and if he pais pays you give him a clear Receipt.
