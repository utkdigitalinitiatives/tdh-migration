copy__ Camp__ Fort Winchester 26th Octo October . 1812 Sir I have just had the honor, to receive your dispatch of the 21st inst instant . which has been read with attention, an do concern to learn that reasons exist to delay the advance of this army, which is in high spirit and anxious to approach the lines of the enemy, indeed they are so much so, that they could not easily reconcile the idea of a few weeks detention.__ The Kentucky Volunteers, are now pretty well disciplined; and I am satisfied, that I hazard nothing as an officer, in saying there is not in the United States a more efficient militia, than the three Kentucky Regiments now at this place. I fear a reluctance in communicating to the ardent spirits, which compose this army, the prospect of a moments delay, in the great work of retaliation.__ Spies who were detached for the purpose returned yesterday, from the rapids, and report that the place is entirely evacuated; with the and many of the houses burned.__ They also state that many hundred acres of corn were yet standing in the field, with the fences open, and stock let into them. I have made arraingements arrangements to march down, and my intention was to have secured the corn, in the first place,__ made a strong camp__

and then build Blockhouses and provided for salting Beef and pork.__ This course I deemed important, to the promotion of the great object of the government.__ It being the rendezvousing point for the north western army, and the intersection of the three great high roads, along which at its supplies must pass__ If this were to be made the principal place of deposit, I fear the river might be closed by frost at the time we should want to navigate it, in which all would depend upon land transportation, which would be a serious object for the flesh part of the ration, and would be obviated if the hogs and beef cattle could be at once drove to the rapids, and there slaughtered and saved .__ I have made sixteen pirogues, which will carry all the flour and whiskey we have forty eight wagons and teams now here, will carry all the baggage.__ For the Quarter Masters store a few more pirogues could soon be made. The leives could be driven, and we could make a good road, and march to the rapid; in a week, if military, policy did not forbid it.__ I have now in store 75,000 rations of flour,__ about 70:000 of beef 200,000 of salt, and 25,000 of whiskey, and five about 22,00 daily, now there can be no

no doubt but hogs, could be driven to the rapids in time to meet our demand, and if pack hordes are relied upon for the flour, I think that also could be furnished in time.__ But of that your situation will enable you to judge more correctly.__ There is still one consideration might come in view.__ It is this, theKentucky volunteers is detained here six weeks longer, would begin to look forward to the expiration of their term of service; An events that might in a measure extinguish that ardent zeal to press forward, which they now have. I shall however wait anxiously for your final answer, which I will hope to receive by express, and will be governed accordingly. I have a letter from the commadent commandant at Fort Wayne asking for a reinforcement and supply of provisions, and have ordered a company from Colonel Bartces regt regiment for that purpose .__ I had ordered Colonel Pogues regt to garrison the Fort, but shall move countermand that order, until your final determination on the subject of our march is known.__ The cloathing clothing is a primary object, and I have full confidence so far as depends on your exertion it will be hastened to the army. It is painful to the feeling mind to see the situation of the regulars in a frosty morning.
