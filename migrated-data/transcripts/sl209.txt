Nashville (Meris School House) Nov November 29 1842 My Dear Mother I have been procrastinating for some time and if excuses were not so common, I should attemp attempt to give one; but you know a school boy who has studdies studies to attend to, has not much time to Spare otherwise than at his studdies. All persons when grown up to the age of maturity regret that they did not devote more of their time to study. Therefore it is eventually requisite that we should study whyle while we have an opportunity and whyle we are at it we should not only study the contense contents of school books, but we should we connect virtue with it and make that the principle part of our studys studies for unless virtue is well studied and fully practiced, we are apt to be led astray; for you know the many vices and evils connected with the habit and dispositions of the ⁁ youth of the pressent present age that it is almost impossible to escape. But virtue ever simple and credulous; conscious of new designs of itself it suspits none in others; it wears no guards before its breast; evry every door and portal and avenue of the heart is thrown open and all who choose it enter. One of the most vicious and poisonous ⁁ enemies to virtue and one whose fang enters deeper in the heart than any other, is the craving appetite for for wealth: and we too frequently ⁁ stop to look upon the many splendid objects which it presents to our mind; and then it is that we are allured from the path of of of virtue, into the dark and mercyless merciless ways of vice, without one bright ry ray of hope to cheer us on our way. Knowledge is

standard and virtue is my guide I frequently think of Old Rock Cave and the many hapy happy hours that I have spent there; but those happy hours have ⁁ passed never more to return and when I ⁁ think that I shall never enjoy them again, it produces quite melancholy feeling We are all getting a long along finely for the hard times: lots of weddings and as the saying is parties till you cant rest. The Capt Captain says that he believes he will sit out as a widower: and I believe there is something it in it, for the topick topic of his conversation is women, and he thinks about them, talks about them, goes to see them, and is so much taken with them, that he even goes so far as to dream about them and Ill tell you what? he is just about the greatest ladies man you ever heard of Tell sister if he does not get see her very soon, my opinion is that she will be a grass widow. Since all this marrying and party business has commenced I am I have got in the notion myself, so you must not be supprised surprised if I bring Mrs Hamilton over next Christmast Christmas I have become quite a gallant since you left here; I go to see the girls very frequently and if you were to see me gallant them up Church street, you would not know me. I was down to see Miss Mary Craighead the other evening and she desired to be remembered to you and sister. Bob and Kitty are as loveing loving as ever and I rather believe if he were were in buisness business , that we would have a wedding Mr Pillar was down to see Susan the other day; the Hill family seem to be very much pleased with him and I think if he would say the word, we would have a match Count Lemonovske (from Poland ) has been lecturing
