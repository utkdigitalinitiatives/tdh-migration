Dresden June 15 1839 Saturday 12 oclock My Dear Wife Yours of yesterday has been recd received . and I feel light hearted at the news from Home. - I had heard of the flight of Cowans Sam . the only thing to be regretted is the injury the men rec received . when pursued him. my information is that they are not killed but badly wounded. Cowan deserves to lose the negro for the silly parade he has made about the negroes honesty and faith &C and et cetera - whenever there is any good feeling or good faith from a slave to the owner it must be when human nature has undergone a revolution. true there are some who are our contented but it is those of a very low grade of intellect - Sam is a man of more sense than Cowan & besides a sly and insinuating scoundrel I am in fine health and buoyant spirits having pretty well mastered my business here. on yesterday I was applied to - to know if I would become attorney for the Bank at Trenten . there business will be worth $1000. or 1500. per annum. I will say easily done. I do not know whether I will get it or not.. Mr Mister Patten who is entirely competent is in the spot & it would seem that it would be more convenient for all parties to imploy employ him but this is for your own eyes My love to the children Yr Your husband Wm William Fitzgerald
