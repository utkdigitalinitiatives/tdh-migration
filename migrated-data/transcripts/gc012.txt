Alexandria (La) Louisiana 21st july 1830 Dear Brother I have deferred writing to you for some time to know to a certainty whether uncle would return home this summer or not, have just recd received a letter from him stating his determination to remain at the white sulphur springs this season with a view of getting his health reinstated if possible, as it was much benefitted by his previous visit, in consequence of his absence I have not been able to send your money but he says he will make immediate arrangements for me to get it at N. New Orleans which as soon as procured (if you so order it) will remit it by mail immediately as there is no other mode of convey ance conveyance from this place that I consider safe, it is a scarce article here and our people are all more or less distressed by the shortness of their crops last year (write me immediately on the subject)

Heahus the other day he is now on a visit to uncle Henry's and on his return I shall go with him to Natchitochy Natchitoches & probably Ouachitta Ouachita to where the Judge resides he afforded me great satisfaction by the news brought from the old dominion they are all well and getting on as usual I have had no letter from there for several months. Crops are fine, we have never had better prospects. though to day today is the first rain we have had for six weeks, we cant boast of a healthy summer as their has been considerable sickness. Cousin Tom & John have both been a little sick but have recovered I am in good health & spirits and shall be married about the middle of October to Miss Bathia I. Leonard a creolle creole of the county she has just returned from Kentucky and I assur assure a you a fine girl, quite small fifteen years old, black hair and eyes and quite intelligent, shall endeavor to alter my course of living which has been rather wild than otherwise
