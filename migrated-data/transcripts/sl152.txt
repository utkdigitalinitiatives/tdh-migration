Live Oak February 17th, 1841 My Dear Jim Your letter of the 10th of January was received a few days since and should have been answered immediately but owing to the indirect communication between this country and Orleans I postponed writing until Mr. Southall was about to leave and therefore commit this to his charge with directions to forward it to Nashville in the event of his not finding you in New Orleans . Josephine and myself are both disappointed that your visit to us has been given out but excuse you very readily (what you say by way of apology I suppose) that your father wishes you at home it is certainly perfectly right and proper that you should remain with him particularly as he desires it. we purposed to left for

North Carolina by this time but business and the pressing solicitations of our friends have detained us we now expect to be off in a week. Their There has been a very interesting trial going on in our Court which has had my attention A man by the name of Sedwith was indicted for being a principal in the second degree in the murder of Gen Read and after a long trial has been found guilty of murder. This you must know is very gratifying to me. I had taken deep interest in it and was very desirous that he should be convicted in this I have succeeded to my utmost wish. Josephine often wishes you were with us and sends her love to you Your friend John R Branch I have directed Southall if you are not in Orleans to direct to Nashville, to show you that I complied with your request
