Columbia June 5/50 Dear Mary We are here, Toby, Tom and I— I last but not least shall leave here for "Mount Pleasant" by 11 oclock AM— Have done but little at collecting— limitted limited to Mc? 35¢ this morning— Everything looks dull here and in fact it is so where I have been— We made 35 miles yesterday pretty good— as I was detained 3 or 4 hours in Franklin — I hope you are all well and that you will continue so—I think of you every hour in the day but the fleas used me so badly last night, I forgot almost everything else— I have no time to write from here — but will write to you from Pulaski and also from Athens — Give my love to all— Kiss Sallie & Lou for me— with a bushel of love— I am Your own George
