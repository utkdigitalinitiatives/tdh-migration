To the Cherokees who are Arming themselves to co-operate cooperate with the Troops of the United States against the hostile Creeks . Friends Brothers. The perfidious Creeks having refused the benevolent measures of the United States calculated to lead their minds to sentiments of civilization have at length spurned the hand that held out to them the greatest favors. They have opened their ears to the talks of our enemies. They have murdered our peacable peaceable citizens, destroying witho' without distinction fathers, mothers, and helpless infants, they have perpetrated these acts of barbarity with circumstances of brutality, cruelty, too base to be described. By these unprovoked acts of barbarity the United States are compelled to send their young warriors from Georgia Tennessee to chastise these enemies of the human race, and to defend the friendly Creeks and their good friends the Cherokees who have refused to lend an ear to the corrupting overtures of our enemies. The Cherokees have taken the talks of their father the President he still holds them by the hand as Children faithfull faithful friends.. Brothers. I flatter myself that in the just necessary war now commencing against the hostile Creeks , your Battalions will be considered as a respectable part of the army according to their numbers. The Generals General Andrew Jackson , General Cocke , General White will consider you as intitled entitled to their care friendly attention as part of their effective force that you have provisions, ammunition medical aid when necessary: in all these you will have equal advantages

with the other troops - and of course it will be expected that you will be obedient to every order regulation that may be made for the government of the whole. being united with your white Brothers by the ties of discipline affection you will in deed with them be a band of Brothers whose minds will rise above every hardship difficulty. Such men may be killed: but cannot be conquered. The staff duties in your Corps will be performed by such Gentlemen as the Commanding General shall attach to your part of the Army they will see that you are provided with what is proper from the Stores magazines, they will keep muster rolls with every mans name on which all casualties will be rimarked remarked , so that every individual will be accounted for. Brothers, you may be assured that I feel very much interested in the parts you will act in co-operation cooperation with our white Brothers against the common enemy - and I anticipate the satisfaction (at the end of the Campaign) of seeing on the muster rolls that you shall have done honor to your nation, to yourselves. You will find the Army to be a school of instruction that will elevate raise up your minds to sentiments unknown to barbarous nations. here it is proper to observe that even in war we never lose sight of humanity. The United States do not make war on women children the aged helpless, they always spare the unresisting prisoner. and I have been much pleased to hear lately similar sentiments from several of the Cherokee Officers who are now arming.

Brothers, I am now to address you on a subject interesting dear to military men, Grades of Rank . Just military pride may be of great advantage to the community; its excess only may be disadvantageous. - I make these observations to men of understanding. Brothers. You are sensible that in military bodies there must be Officers of different degrees of rank. I have no doubt that in your nation there are more men worthy of high rank than can at present be appointed; having reference to the number of armed Cherokees , this being the case, I persuade myself that you will not let there be any contention about rank; considering that harmony union will make you strong make you happy; and we must look forward. The war in our part of the United States is but just commencing. There may be yet time enough for every man of ability real merit to have such rank as he may wish. WE must consider that we are a band of Brothers in this war acting in a common cause where all will vie with each other in doing the most good without contending for an Epaulette, a Cockade, or a Feather, considering keeping in mind that these may be ours at some time if we do our duty that in a short time they may fall to your lot without any thing lying in the way. You may rely on it that those who shall distinguish themselves will not be neglected. Their names will be known to their father the President, exhibitted exhibited also to the view of the public. My Brothers you are now acting a part in co-operation cooperation with your white Brothers under the orders in sight of the Generals of the Army. The eyes of the whole Army

are turned towards you. The citizens of the United States and the whole of your nation are spectators of your conduct in Arms, and all feel an interest that you should do your duty. The Gentlemen selected by the General to perform the duties of the Staff Department in your Corps will do every thing in their line to aid give activity to the movements that may be required of your troops; on all occasions will contribute their friendly advice help to make you as comfortable as can comport with the hardihood of american soldiers. You all know my wishes, I will only add God Bless you Return J. Meigs Highwassee Garrison 29th. October 1813
