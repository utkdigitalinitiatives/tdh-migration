Cornplanter Augst August 17th My dear Wm William You will be pleased to hear that the 12th is past, and I am alive and well. I had no fear on the subject, nor any presentiment, and therefore do not feel as grateful as I should do for my lengthened days. We are all as well as when you were here — The millwrights leave us tomorrow and I have not had time to see all the machinery in motion, though I heard Mrs. Young say last week, that persons often went distance to see a show, that was not as well worth seeing as the machinery in the mill. She also says you look a wholesome youth, for the people here do not think you are of age

On Friday last, Wylie went to Franklin , and did not have a letter from you, to any of the family. I was so certain of receiving one, that I was not prepared for such a disappoint ment consequently I had an attack of degestion , from which a good hearty cry relieved me. You should never let me suffer any anxiety respecting you or our sisters, for when you are silent, my active imagination construct it into sickness or death. I sometimes wish I did not think so much about you all, and again I would not for any consideration relinquish the pleasure which the the the remembrance of you all create. We are expecting a sister of Wm. William Marsh here next month on a visit and in October 3 of the Bell family from Pittsburgh so that we shall have kinsfolk in abundance and if we had a Tennessee Bell, I for one would be content.

The geraniums are just living, I look at them often in a day they being in my way to the cellar the whortle berries are not yet out of season, a fresh supply today. I suppose you will conclude from the length of this epistle I have very little to but you are much mistaken for I am almost tired to death after the labors of the day Margaret having been in the wash house all the day. You can scarcely imagine the destruction that was made in the cucumbers, onions, potatoes and beets in the boarding roo All the young folks are if they were up they would say give my love to cousin Wm. William Give an abundance of affection to the sisterhood for me for me. Write every week whether it rains or not — remember that Old Mas is selling wishing at the opposite side of the table. say he can but the wishing which of course you do not doubt
