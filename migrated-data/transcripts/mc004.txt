Mouth of Poplar Creek Aug. August 18th 1833 Dear Brother I sit down this good sabbath day to write you a letter, we have waited thus long for the happening of certain events that we might give you a full account of as I Should have written sooner among other things the collection of that money at Huntsville is one which is not yet Accomplished however Col Colonel Brandon has written that it is ready in his hand and will be transmitted by mail so soon as he receives the proper authority which has recently been sent him but as yet no return although there has been time for it to have been down. The elections is another the results of which I will give you in as brief a manner as possible. Blair is repr. representative to Congr. Congress in the 1st Dest. District beating Genl. General Carter about 11 & Tom Arnold 25 hundred votes Carter knocked Arnold off the stump whilst he was making a speech a short time before the Elections Bunch in the 2nd beating Cocket Lea in the 3 beating Joseph Williams & Finley Gellespie standofer is our representative beating Green 1100 & some add votes & so an Cal Vernon beat Brazzeal for sennate senate

by a great majority I know not how much In the Knoxville district Spencer Jarnagan is the membr member for repr. representative stocton is our membr member beating John W. Wester 240 & Buchn. Buchanan upwards of 400 Votes Gilliland declined & gave his support to Stocton or Wester would have been him The most essential of those members you will no doubt have heard from before this reaches you & also those of the western members to Congress however the first account was that Fitzgerald was one of the delegates from this state but am of the last Nashville papers contradicts that report & declares Davy Crockett the man by a majority of 49 votes I will Quit this Epistle & give you something else that you will probably feel more interested in. I have seen & heard from Wm. William H. Love occationally occasionally he was the last account well & selling judge Mitchell's Book I received a letter from J Mitchell yesterday he and his friends were all well there is some little Cholera in that County Though there has been none in E Tenn East Tennessee yet at least there is a great deal of skepticism about its being in Knoxville & in Kingston the only two
