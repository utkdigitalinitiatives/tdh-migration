Portsmouth Jany January 21 29 1829 Beloved Genl General I have recently heard of the funeral solemnities of Mrs Jackson , which has pierced my heart with a thousand sorrows; not only mine, but my dear wife & children seem to feel a tender sympathy for you why should I talk of myself & Family may I not say that even the great majority of this whole nation, would not in sackcloth if they could have prolonged the life of that amiable & dignified form who has now been taken from your affectionate bosom__ Oh that I could find a balm of assuage the greef grief of a heart bleeding under the aggravated strokes of divine Providence__ Had it been Father, or Brother, I could more sensibly have joined you in drinking the bitter cup___ Permit me to say that you have not to morn mourn us they that have no hope for you nor I have no reason to doubt from her virtuous life, but that your affectionate companion is now in heaven far above the contentions of this world. and if she could be permited permitted as a guardian angel to watch over any one she would undoubtly undoubtedly direct her flight towards him, who morns her absence, and who kneeds needs at this critical moment some angel of mercy to be near__
