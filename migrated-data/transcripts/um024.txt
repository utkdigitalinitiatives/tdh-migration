Columbia Oct October 6 1840 My Dear Sister On this pleasant evening I could not choose a more pleasant task than to write to my little sister. I ⁁ se received your kind and affectionate on letter yesterday. It gratified me very much indeed to see that you could write such an inteligent intelligent letter. I have recovered ⁁ entirely from my sickness; and commenced school week before last. I am very much pleased with the Insitute indeed. I have received no cencures censures yet, but it is very difficult to keep them off of my list. I am in the Second Senior Department we all have to study very hard indeed . We sit up every night until l 9, o'clock, and get up at daybreak every morning. I am taking Music lessons under a very fine teacher indeed , Mrs Bolman , Boardman she pays a great deal of attention to my fingering. I practice from 8 until 9 O'Clock every night. I sleep in the third S tory, no capital in the long Dormitory. Dear sister you say that I do not ⁁ write to you often enough; hereafter I shall try to write to you every week as I have composition to write then and I shall write a letter in its place. Sister you forgot to write me what cousin Martha Ann has named her fine son. O' I should like to see him so much. I expect Aunt P. & uncle Will are very much delighted that it is a son. Tell Aunt Narcissa that I shall write to her next week; but one letter must do for you all for we are not allowed to write but one letter a

week. I want to see you all so very much that I can scarcely study for thinking of home. O' why do not some of my relation write to me I think that some of them might write to me . tell them that they must not wait to receive a letter from me. You do not know how very bad I feel when all of the letters come and there is none for me. tell Aunt Narcissa I thought that her ; Aunt F. and cousin Jane were going to write to me directly I arrived here; and I have not received one line from them yet. I received a letter from cousin Rachel last Saturday; she says that they are all very well and that Florida is very gay. Oh! she you said that I had forgot to tell the name of the little girl that sent her love to you; it was Ann Maria Walker . I expect that Brother Sam looks very sweet with his new tooth. O' I do want to see him so much. Why dont cousin Dick write to me it is getting very late now and I go to book as cousin Will says. I remain your affectionate Sister M. J.
