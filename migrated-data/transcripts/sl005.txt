Head quarters Fort StrotherDecbrDecember 19th 18 13Dear SirThe Blankets has not reached this place as yet whenever they come up, I will send you the order to cover the number sent on, and the quarter master's receipt for the same. I fear before they reach me I shall have 20 men to buy or wear them and my camp will be deserted without any means taken by the Governor fill their vacancy, by Draft. I have wrote by several expresses, in due time to have reached him and his answer have been to hand before the 10th instant, had is answer been such as I am now told it is the Tennessee Volunteers Infantry would have been still here doing there duty as good soldiers or receiving examplarory punishment for disobedienceThe East Tennessee  it appears was only brought into the field for three months, and not one under the requisition of the Secretary of War. All named Marching home but one  Regt.Regiment whose time will be up the 14th proximo, and behold the Militia from my Division has caught the disease, and home they must be on the 4th Inst.Instant Months — I have said to them— that they are in for the campaign or under the act of Congress, but I shall be governed by the opinion of the Governor. This a campaign so necessary for the safety and protection of the fronteersfrontiers, so far as Tennessee has to take a part in it is likely to be shamefully abandoned, and the reputation of the state eternally disgraced, and no ----- act as far as I can learn to prevent it, what is the Governor about, is his feelings ready to submit to such a disgraceful scene, after our boasted patriotism, and fervent wishes to be permitedpermitted to carry war and destruction into the hands bowels of the Creek Nation, and after the fortunate ----- entrance made into it contrary to the underhand endeavourendeavor to prevent me from opperationoperation from the want of supplies, which I expected from Genl GeneralCockeand his command  to GenlGeneral White (which I  enclose to the governor and will explain all and every matter and thing as it respects the cooperation and supplies promised by GenlGeneral Cocke, all which is noted and in due time will be attended to— for the Lord's sake arouse the governor from his Lethargy — bring to his view the disgraceful precipice, on which the credit of the State stands and he will exert himself  — let the Militia under the requisition of the President, as adopted under the late law of the State be drafted for six months, and sent on to fill up the disgraceful retrograde of the Volunteers, or let him peremptory, order the Volunteers to return if he believes he has not the power to discharge them and let him issue a general order, directing all deserters to be apprehended,  and transferred to the regular army, there to serve the balance of their time, let him do this and explain at what time GenlGeneral Roberts Brigade Service ends, and should it end on the 4th proximo say to him unless at that period our cooperation as and from Tennessee as promised and expected by the President of  the United States, and by GenlGeneral Pinkney. The commander in chief, is to end and our state eternally disgraced, that he must exert himself fulfill his powers and order a requisition to be up against the days that those in service expires, this is the conduct of the Surgeons and others. GenlGeneral Floyd's Brigade time of Service has expired having served 6 months, & till the express informs me, that the Governor of Georgia has the (relief) is at hand and (will) reach him before the first requisition is discharged— this is proper and right— and I hope the Governor will exert himself, and save our State from everlasting disgrace. I have ordered Genl GeneralCocke back to fill up the requisition of the Secretary of War made throthrough Governor of the State, had this been done at first regardless of the disgraceful retrograde of the T. V. S. Infantry I should been moving on and soon put an end to the Creek War.
