Feb February 8 1834 Dear Sir Since my return from the East I have been put in possession of a brief note of yours to myself & which accompanied the last communication of yours published in the Revivalist. The very disagreable disagreeable controversy which has grown out of the publication of Br,, Brother Morgan s letter has been to me a sourse source of pain & mortification Yet I must say that I am not yet convinced that I did wrong in publishing that letter although I do not indorse; all its sentiments. Frequent complaints have been made and by Cumberland Presbyterians of high standing that we were in some instances running into injurious excesses and I then thought and still think that no disadvantage to the cause of Christ could possibly ensue from a fair and christian discussion of the subject. I am sorry however to find that much bad spirit prevails on account of it and that I am censured severly severely by both parties. In justice to myself I am bound to say

that I heartily dissaprove of Amicas and had I been at home his piece would not have been published I think you must have misunderstood Br Anderson who assures me he had no design to side with either party He is a thurough thorough Cumberland Presbyterian and the son of your former fellow labour labor of that name and as is natural strongly attached to the measures of the revival of 1800 As regards the dessatesfaction dissatisfaction of the Brethren in your country I am sorry it should exist but trust that they have more prudence than to attempt in the present state of the church to get up a paper there The Cumberland Church heretofore has not been able to give a liberal patronage to one paper and if this be true she will only disgrace herself by attempting to have 3 or 4 as will be the case if the brethren of the east & west put their threats into execution. But I would seriously advise the church to make this establishment her property and appoint some person to take charge of it in whose views and prudence & they have confidence. For my own part I acknowledge that I am heartily sick of my situation and

nothing short of the firm conviction that the church would be without a paper and consequently sustain great loss enduced induced me at the earnest solicitations of the last assembly to purchase the whole concern from Mr Lenry to whom I paid $1500.00 and took upon myself all the debts owing by the establishment From that time to the present I have been grapling grapling with the most serious difficulties and to be enabled to meet the heavy demands against the press I have been travelling constantly Indeed from 1st of June I have been with my family on 3 sabbaths of have paid debts owing by the press to the amount of $5000.00 Indeed nothing short of the most rigorous exertions could have kept it alive until now. The Revivalist is a waking conun all my private resources are swallowed up by it & my brethren making no exertions to promote its interests but in too many instances treating me in a most unchristian manner witness the defence of Br Guthrie From then and ther underating I have determined (and I think I will do duty) not to continue the publication of the Revivalist at my own risk longer than the assembly unless such measures are addressed as I have no expectations of And I expect that the pledge of the assembly will be redeemed Very that the office will be better off my hands __ I deem it my indespensible indispensable duty to give you and other influential

And I would earnestly beg for the sake of the bleeding cause of Christ that if it is at all practicable you will be present at the next assembly __ I am sorry that it will be my duty to engage with Br Miller I feel my dessuncy but with the fear of God before me and relying on his aid I will try to reply I trust in the spirit of Christ Yours affectionately James Smith Nashville 5th Feby February 1834 Finis Ewing Lexington Missouri miscellaneous scribbling Rev J Reverend James Smith Feb 5 1834 members of the church due notice of the course I shall feel it my duty to pursue that they may adopt such measures as they may deem best calculated to secure the interests of the church__
