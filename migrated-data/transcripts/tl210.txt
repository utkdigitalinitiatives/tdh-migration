Paris West Dist District Febry February 3rd 1828 Dear Genl General I hail you welcome on your return, and hope you have had a pleasant trip; but so various and contradictory are the accounts which we have received of the reception the old Chief met with that we are at a loss what to think of it. One of the New Orleans papers (the Argus) received here yesterday, says the Genls General's reception was cold & indifferent, that the streets were comparatively deserted as walked them; no demonstrations of Joy or satisfaction welcomed him, except from a few hot headed partizans partisans &c et cetera which makes the administration men of this town (and there are a good many) hold up their heads and excitingly taunt us with disappointment. On the contrary the "Advertiser" says the Gen General was welcomed by a greater concourse of people than was ever assembled in the City; which I have no doubt is true; also a cousin of mine, a commission merchant of the city writes me that business of every description was suspended during the old heros hero's stay ⁁ among them. Such are the accounts of celebration in New Orleans, and each party believes that which digests best upon his stomach. Mr Clay's pamphlet is another cause of triumph with the Adams

men in this section; but I have some facts & arguments " laid up in ordinary" as Mordecai says, which are strong as the decrees of Fate , that I intend to bring out in about two weeks, perhaps sooner. I have never yet, except in one instance, and that you did not see, made an attempt at display on this subject, for the reason that were so many scribblers employed in the business that a sober ⁁ or moderate man has scarcely any chance to be heard. I intend to bring forth a production this time that will command attention.— I want you, the first leisure half day you have, to sit down and read the 18. 19 and 20th Numbers of Scriblerus in the West Tennessean, and say if I am not at home some future day, to gain immortality for the invention or discovery of a new system of Philosophy on Magnetism ! I have been about three years at work at it, in conjunction with a friend, and have at length matured it, and do most sincerly sincerely believe it will eventually take; I have gained a number of converts in this country. I have the finest looking, the smartest, and the keenest-eyed son in the state, now six weeks old. I call him, after my friend, Saml Samuel Houston ; and think he will succeed him in his office in less than 35 years. It is the prevailing opinion, and common to talk here that Gen General Carroll is to be the opposing candidate at the next Gubernatorial election, and I much fear it

will even be the case, in that event much exertion will be necessary, for he is a mighty man, I find, amongst the folks . But I am gradually gaining an influence with and an extended circulation of my paper, and thing think by prudent management, I will be able by that time to yield a considerable influence, if I am able to keep up ⁁ my office but unless I can make or rather collect more money than I have hitherto been able to do I do not know whether I can keep along or not.— I looked for some particulars on the subject of which we talked when I was in Nashville , before you went below, but I suppose the hurry of preparation for so important an affair prevented it. I addressed a letter to Col Colonel James I. Green on the subject, but received no answer, the cause of which I cannot account for. Be so good as to throw together all the materials you think necessary, and forward them to me as soon as convenient, I am anxious to perform that task, and have the vanity to believe I can do it tolerable Justice. Desha & Brent , I understand, are going to fight , I think it nothing but right that Brent should be slapped for his impertinence, and I reckon none of the Tennessee delegation are better are better calculated to do it than Gen General Desha . I remain dear sir with real esteem & respect Your obt servt obedient servant G. W. Terrill His Exelcy Gov Excellency Governor Houston}
