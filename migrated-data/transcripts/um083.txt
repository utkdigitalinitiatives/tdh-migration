Columbia Tennessee Decbr December [14th] 42 My dear Papa, I answer your kind letter now, which I received last Sunday by Uncle Walker , he was detained at the Iron Works in which Cousin Sam has some share, or is engaged in some way I dont do not precisely know and therefore did not get home so soon as he expected; he gave me a great deal of news, said that he saw all the children, and that you were all enjoying good health; but he was unable to tell me when you will be up to see me. Indeed dear Papa you have remained so long silent, in your letters, upon that subject, that I'm uncertain, whether I must look for you or not. If you only knew how very anxious I am to see you, I feel certain that if it were possible you would come. I am aware that your business prevented you from coming at the time appointed, but hope that you will have leisure to come before Christmas, which you must remember is very near — and then the Examination. I can assure you

that it is looked forward to, with dread, by us all. You, I expect know from experience how very trying, and embarassing embarrassing it is to any one to stand a Public Examination . We have commenced reveiwing reviewing in all our studies, to day, and it is the rule in our class that we are not to go over a sentance sentence without understanding precisely its meaning. A French Tutoress arrived at the Institute the other day, She is a French lady; and we are not permitted to speak to her in any language but that. I think that we will improve more by that Means. Cousin Sam has made a new arrangement in his family. his Father in law and family [ Mr Wormely ] and himself all live together, quite a large family ⁁ of us I assure you. It reminds me of last winter when there were fifteen of the Children staying at Aunt Butler's . Papa you said that I have not acknowledged the receipt of the $5 that you sent me 28th Oct. October indeed I was under the impression that I did in the letter after I received it. I had also the pleasure of receiving the $10 that you sent by Uncle Walker, for which I thank you very much, as I was in need of it then. I bought me a very handsome Mouslin Muslin with it. it was 87 ½ cts cents a yd. yard which including the trimmings took the whole of the $10 — This will superede supersede the necessity of your bringing me one. But Cousin Ellen thinks that I need a Calico. I must say that I think so too. I am making my dress myself with Cousin Ellen's kind assistance. she thinks that I sew very well. I keep an account of all the articles that I get, you will I expect

think me very particular, but I merely wish to show you that your daughter is not so extravagant as She has always had the character of being. As Cousin Sam leaves home in a day or two, he handed me my School Bills to inclose enclose in this letter. he said that he is very much engaged or he would write himself. I want see Dear little Sam, my Sister, Brothers and all my little Cousins very very much. Tell Aunt Narcissa I hope that she will not let my letter remain long unanswered. We have a considerable Revival of Religion here, both in the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches. The meeting is still going on. they have Mourners every night. It is now bed time and I must bid you good night Give my love to all. Your afft. affectionate Daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester Alice Bennis has entirely recovered from the Moumps Mumps sends her love to sister, and says that she would be very glad to receive a letter from her.
