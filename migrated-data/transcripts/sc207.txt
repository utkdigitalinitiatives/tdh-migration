Yorkville Octbr October 1827 My Dear Sarah! I promised to write you when I returned to Baltr Baltimore but as that will not be for two months to come_ I see no reason why the correspondence may not commence from this same , paradise, of Mrs. Smiths ,_ Where I certainly have much more leisure if not a greater variety of interesting matter to fill my paper_ as I make it a point of conscience to give my friends the value of postage in the quantity, if not the in quality. As a frank may now be obtained, from the Judge, at Uncle Sams expense_ I shall_ notwithstanding my amor patrie, save you freight upon this precious cargo__ I left Huntsville with regret_ I had, in a short time, made many agreeable acqua acquaintances, and, I hope, some friends, whom it saddens my heart to think I may never see more, until the resurrection morn, when there will be an eternal union or seperation separation of all we most loved on earth_ Since it was not convenient, without putting others to an inconvenience, to spend the time I must necessarily remain in this state, amongst my husbands family in Pendleton _ I could wish for Alladdin's Lamp, a fairy's ring_ or the wings of a zephyr, to convey me with all speed into your comfortable hall, which beguiled me of many pleasant hours, and where I could forget or leave behind me the cold hearted selfishness and unsocial air that infested_ Spring Grove _ The roads through the Cherokee Nation were pronounced by the Judge & Mrs. Smith much worse than the Knoxville route_ and those who recommended the first recieved received neither thanks or blessings But there was one, and only one which pleasing ingredient which with them, make up all other deficiencies, and that was_ cheapness_ which should be a primary consideration with us all_

Mary continues in good health, but, to her delight is somewhat thiner thinner ,_ and to my sorrow be it known, I have gained many pounds and am daily adding to my weight_ The Judge takes his rations with the best of us_and therefore, may be pronounced convalescent_ His better or rather larger half is in bed with her usual complaint headache, and for a week, we have been gliding upon tip-toe about the house, and living with closed doors, few very few venturing to disturb the solemn stillness which surrounds this hospo hospitable mansion_ However I must do the good citizens the justice to say that we have been invited to one ball_ and that a sister widow has taken compassion on my solitude and invited us to spend this evening with her_ Which like hungry beggars Mary & I greedily, accepted_ pray keep this scandal to yourself, for you know Mr McClung cannot keep any thing from his other self Mr. White , and then it may get into the religious world that the religious Mrs. T_ instead of reading her Bible, as she now has ample oportunity oppurtunity is back-biting her dear friends_ I received a long letter from Juliana, which with one from Mrs Bolles followed me from Huntsville, both sent their love and some other messages to you_ I received here pleasing accounts of a revival of religion in Baltimore , a sister and many acquaintances were amongst the number added unto the Lord_ What a blessed change_ forty-eight members joined the church ( presbeterian Presbyterian ) of Mr. Nevins at one communion_ Mr. Allan would rejoice at the good tidings_ Don't forget when you see him to make my most respectful compliments to him_ Aslo Also to Mrs. Brein & Hutchin's _ Mrs. Dibb _ and Clay with any others to whom may think them acceptable_ Above all give my love to Mrs. Toby & family_ I do not forget my friend Mr Harris and the carnage break_ thank him for sending on my letters with his name endorsed on them, it assured one he was still in the land of the living_ I wish I could have the same assurance of all I left behind_ Do write immediately on the receipt of this, or employ Mr. McClung who I recollect proffered his services on the occasion. I feel very anxious to learn how his trial has terminated_ You did not give me any commissions, if I can serve you, fail not to command me. If Mary knew I was writing to you she would add her love_ take it for granted that you and Mr McClung are in high in her estimation as well as your Friend F Taylor
