Pleasant Plains . May 20th 1828 My dear and affectionate friend, I seldom go to Clarksville & have forgotten the time of the courts in Charlotte or I would send letters by the lawyers Do not suffer yourself to do me the injustice of believing even for an instant that time or absense absence could efface your remembrance from my heart believe me your idea is too deeply impressed for any thing to eradicate. Accident may prevent our intercourse as frequently by letter as I could wish, but nothing less than your neglect will prevent my continued endeavours endeavors to promote a constant correspondence by letter. The sickness of one of my Brothers in law as well as that of my sister has prevented my answering your kind letter soon, but you are too much the slave of duty if I may use the term to censure your less steady friend for complying with its dictates even though it has protracted any pleasure you might feel from an immediate answer to your letter. My life is one unvaried routine of employment; occasionly occasionally but very seldom releived relieved by some little party of pleasure or visit to my young friends in the neighbourhood neighborhood so you may suppose I have nothing to communicate worthy your attention but judgeing judging of you by myself I would still write though I only said. My dear Ann I am I love you as well as ever & I hope I still retain the place I claim in your regard. We have had an uncommon winter in more respects than one. Since my recollection I have never heard of as much sickness and as many deaths. Since my recovery from the fever last fall I have enjoyed, interrupted health & I suppose

you would scarcely recognize the pale thin invalid of Charlotte in the blooming lass of Pleasant Plains. My personal appearance has alone experienced a change for I still think of your lectures with the same gratitude. I formerly felt & look up to your superiority in talent & information with the same admiration unmixed with envy. As my letter concerning my trip to the District has miscarried I will in this as I have nothing better to write give you some account of it. Montgomery being my own county I scarcely noticed setting out like most travellers to see foreign wonders & passing over perhaps what is more worthy of remark near home. I first began to look about me when it was announced that I was in Stewart I was immediately all eye an and ear but nothing could I see but hill after hill almost as high as mountains & in fact might so be termed as they served to fatigue both horse & rider. There is something also uncommon in the streams in which the country abounds they being of a deep blue & very clear I can scarcely describe my feelings on arriving in sight of the Tennessee river it was a bright morning & as we started early we arrived on its banks just as the mists had arisen sufficiently high to give us an unobstructed view of the rive & its banks. It appeared to me a world of water. You who have crossed the Ocean will laugh at my admiration and wonder being lavished on a stream inferior to many in our country but it is by far the largest I ever saw. From the sensation of awe I experienced in crossing I am convinced I am too great a coward ever to cross the Atlantic . The change in the appearance and taste

of the water as soon as we entered Henry County in the District is surprising it had the colour color of lye & a very disagreeable taste. Had not the country been so flat I might have fancied myself in Scotland from the number of morasses swamps &C. et cetera in which it would have been very unsafe to venture had they not been causewayed. In Madison County the water was of a chalky hue & very warm & unpleasant taste. In Hardeman the county in which my brother lives it is much better & after I became used to it I liked it as well as our own— it is freistone firestone perhaps you have noticed the difference between it and limestone. My stay was short but my time was spent as agreeably as the united endeavours endeavors of all my acquaintances use me could make it. My brother in his last letter spoke ing over this summer & expects unless I write to the contrary for me to accompany him back I have not yet determined what I shall do. I do not go to Alabama I have rejected one offer & a second lies unanswered before me but it will meet with the same fate. How I wish I had your opportunity of getting books but it is best as it is as I have no pretention to your self command I should spend more time in the perusal of them than I could spare without neglecting other employment equally necessary. Ann Jordan is married I hear from what I can understand badly. I have heard notthing nothing of person Catherine or Elizabeth lately. Our Old friend Mrs. Clements is still in bad health I am very anxious to see her & indeed all my friends in Dickson Several weddings are talked of but whether or

not they will be carried into effect time alone will determine. Eudora has grown very much I still endeavour endeavor to keep up her studies at home but I find it a very difficult task and I should never have succeeded in educating her on this plan too many interruptions occur When you write let me know whether you have heard lately from Mrs. Robertson & whether Majr. Major Hicks & Miss Nancy are married or not. Present my love to Mr. & Mrs. Collier & Mrs. Clinton & indeed all my friends not forgetting Mr. & Mrs Vorh — My best wishes will ever attend your family. Write often an and forget not that you have ever a sincere and affectionate friend in Ann T. Barry One of my nieces have lost my knife, since I commenced this so that I have been unwillingly compelled to scribble as usual. Clarksville, Ten Tennessee May 25 Miss. Ann J.
