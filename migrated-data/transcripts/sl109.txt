Clover Dale Sept September 18 1837 My dear sister As you know my aversion to letter writing, I deem it quite unnecessary to apologize for having delayed answering your letter sooner, and I hope you will not be unreasonable as to expect more than two or three from me in the course of a year, Papa is much better he is able to walk about the yard and he has been to the barn field once, he is reduced very much, and this is by far the severest spell he has had since we came to Tennessee , the rest of the family are all very well; I have not been sick but one day since you left here and that was occasioned by eating tooo too many of Allens good apples. I wish you were now here to participate in the heart felt heartfelt joy of many of our dear friends, who professed religion last week at the Campmeeting Camp meeting on Jhonsons Johnson's creek with Squire Caldwell & wife Mary Campbell , Sarah Cruse , Fredonia and Betsey Walker , Eliza and John J Hardwich , Indiania Massie , Tom Richardson a brother of the Dr Prior Smith , and Benjamin Robertson , his wife had professed shortly before. The number of those that professed was estimated at 60, 40 of whom joined that church, I had forgotten to mention Mrs Davies and Allen Neslick Araminto and Amanda were very much affected, but on account of a promise their father exacted from them Wednesday morning they would not you must excuse bad composition, & bad writing too for I cannot get a good pen We all join in best love to brother John & S. Samuel & your self yours affectionately C Caroline D. Bell .

go in to the altar, but Araminto sent for Mr. Guthrie to come to where she was sitting, to talk and to pray with her, Dr. Hudson and Major Bell shed tears manfully. When Ben Robertson professed he was very anxious to see Chris Dickson , but he was equally as anxious to avoid him, and although they were both on the same ground they did not meet untill until the next day, and those that witnessed it say it was a very affecting scene. At the close of the meeting, which commenced on the 8 and lasted untill until the 13 , Prior Smith stood upon a bench and prayed for and exorted exhorted the Preachers & Christians very much and said that it was right they should part to propogate propagate religion for they were the salt of the earth, and John James ' excellent prayers for Eliza 's conversion astonished them all very much. Eliza ⁁ H and Mary C laughed and shouted very much indeed they were affected in the same manner they were when they took either Eliza said she always thought she would cry when she professed religion but she did not feel like crying now. There were a great many preachers present among the number were Mr Burniep & Mr Ray , the former has improved very much, but I think one of our circuit ⁁ riders Mr Pope excels him. There is to be a three days meeting at New Hope the third week in next month and if the neighbors will camp on the ground there will be preaching as long as they can do any good or the people will attend The Methodists had an appointment for a two days meeting on White Oak last month and the people appeared so anxious and willing to attend that it continued six days

We expect Mr Wade & Sarah the last day of this week Mr Mills is gone to Kentucky , Mr Hayes a Presbyterian Preacher of Nashville is to preach Mr Farrars and Mrs Napiers funeral at Squire Napiers next month. Mr H Hays was the person that connected B Robertson I declare you are a strange being and I always thought so, I suppose you could not see Mr Foote & Mr Shamran because they were widowers, but why did you not see Mr Campbell , & Dr. Hill / if you were confined to your bed it should not be any for excuse for your not seeing a clergyman, particularly an old acquaintance. I had no doubt but you sorta quality would be mightily set up with the attentions of the first quality of Philadelphia , but all is the pleasure of seeing so many of our relations. I have been for an introduction to that celebrated correspondent of yours. 24 Mr Vanbier returned the day before yesterday, we received the parcel you sent by him, and are very much pleased with the contents of it, I think I can wear one pr of the gaiter boots but Margaret cannot, Ellenora will remain in Nashville until the sickly season is over. William s Cap fits him very well. There has been a subscription raised in Charlotte to the amount of 33$ for the purpose of building a shelter at New Hope . your friend Thee subscribed $.

Every person is going to campmeeting camp meeting now for the express purpose of getting religion.

The Dahlia has bloomed, it is a great large red thing but Margaret & Mary pretend to admire it very much. Your friends desire to be remembered to you.
