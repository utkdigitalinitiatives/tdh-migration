Br RR Ten Rail Road Tennessee ' Sommerville Janny January 13 1844 To His Excellency James C Jones Governor Being firmly convinced of the necessity of having an additional clerk in this Branch. I have thought it proper to address you on the subject, hoping that you would give it attention. The labor to be performed at this Branch by its officers, is greater than at any of the others.__ It has made, & paid to the state spirit on its capital regularly every half year, There is therefore neither justice nor equality in placing us on the same footing with others, and Rogersville . It is important to the welfare of the institution, that an additional clerk should be allowed, The reason why application was never made before, is this, there was a Running imployed employed , who, discharged the duties of clerk when not delivering notices. But a late decision of the Supreme Court rendered it unnecessary to employ him longer as Running, and he was discharged, Very respectfully W. Houston
