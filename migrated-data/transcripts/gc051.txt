James M King Esq Esquire Sometime last year Mr Mister More placd placed in my hands for collection a note on Jnuss Hineman for about five hundred dollars I brought suit agat against Hineman in the circuit court of Mehainy & obtained judgment- he removed to Lincoln County I have had the execution sent after him I this evening recd received a letter states stating that the sheriff has levied the execution on a tract of land in Lincoln cty county containing 118 acres which the shff sheriff thinks is worth five or ten hundred dollars but believes it will not sell for much unless you had an agent their to bid it off- The sale will take place on the 14 this month- Had you willin willing send out some person to see to it or go go yourself, I think if you were to attend the sale your debt might be made- Hineman carried off a negroe boy from Mcraig about 13 years of age. I write in hast haste as the mail is about closing very respectfully Austin Miller
