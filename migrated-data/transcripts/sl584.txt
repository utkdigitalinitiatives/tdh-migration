President would appoint major Freeman to run another line between them & the State of Tennessee, as they want nothing but justice done there. Thus have I given you a fair & plain statement of the case, & if it should prove by another line being run that the present one is incorrect no doubt the nation will receive from our government ample justice. I am respectfully Your obed. Servt. Obediant Servant G.L. Sherburne agent for the Chickasaw Nation of indians Genl General . J James . Winchester
