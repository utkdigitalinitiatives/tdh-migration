Washington, D. C. Feby February 15th 1849 Dear Alex Herewith I enclose you a receipt for two dollars, which I paid today for your subscription of the Weekly Union to include 15 Feby February 1850 . I tried to ascertain the state of your account by the books but was not able to do so. You have no credits on the books at all, and I knew that was not right and did not pay the back amount. You began to take the papers on the first of May 1845 . Will you state the amounts you first paid and indeed the whole history of the affair, and ‚ÅÅ send me any receipts you may have to show the matter, and did you ever subscribe for the Globe before that time, The cause of your paper being discontinued was the similarity between our names (A. J. & A. D.) when I went to New Orleans I directed my paper to be sent to that place, and to discontinue it at Florence, and they mistook the names, Write early on the subject. This is a horrible place, worse than at San Antonio , Horrid climate, horrid manners, and horrid people, I would not live here for a mint minute . Frank has been quite sick since we have been here, but I am happy to report him better, I am in great haste so you will excuse me. Betty joins me in love to one & all friends Yours truly Andrew J. Coffee I believe you wanted the weekly paper, if I am mistaken let me know.
