Ross' Landing Ten Tennessee Novr November 5th 1838 Dear Sir Your kind letter of about the 23rd Septr. September was recd. received some time since & should have been answered sooner, but business & absence from home must has prevented it I gladly accept your proposition to continue a more regular correspondence, and from present appearance I will not be likely soon again to offer business as an excuse for not writing, as I am now out of any kind__ my dear old uncle, Sam, stoped stopped my per diem allowance on the 31st October & I am now, as the boatsmen say "lying on my oars." I was at Roane Court & at your Mother week before last_ the family were all well, Henry & DeWitt had both been unwell but had recovered._ Frederick started to Arkansas about two weeks ago, which the family did not know when I saw them__ They were then expecting that probably all the family would be together about the last of this month, as they had heard that you & Lewis were both coming about that time, & I promise to take Catherine up. Times in the Ocoee District are becoming quite dull, all the troops are gone except a few at the Agency, perhaps our company_ & all the Indians except about 1500 are on their way West, & they are

to start very shortly, & the absence of both these evils together with the lowness of the waters will have a tendency to produce quite dull times_ but the opening of the land Office in Cleveland this day will probably create some excitement_ I dont expect to trouble the office much myself_ I have been buying town property in this place for a speculation & from present appearances it may turn out a bad speculation. Our prospects have recd. a damper from the report of the Engineer for the Ga. Georgia Rail Road being rather against us_ he reports favourably favorably of the mouth of Chickamauga , a few miles above this, but we still have hopes of its being made to this place_ We have an older charter for a Rail Road than the one given to Ga. which will likely bring us in collision with Ga if she goes to the river at a different point. Catherine wishes to be rembered remembered to you & Mrs W. Welcker and says she is sorry to learn that she will not have her company in Roane this fall & she wishes to know if Margaret Elizabeth is coming up with you. Our little family are in tolerable health, our little daughter now a few days over 9 months old is very stout & hearty, and is certainly the loveliest little creature we ever saw__ we have never heard the name of yours_ Will this place be in your route to Roane, if so we could probably go to gether together from here,

if we do not travel too slowly for you__ Our Puss is so large & heavy we will have to haul her up. Novr 6th We are all well_ The mail will be closed shortly, & I must close Affectionately A. Albert S. Lenoir Mr C. F. Charles Frederick Welcker
