Nashville Oct October 14th 1847 Dear Mother I received a letter yesterday from William H. Morgan saying you had returned to Russellville — Therefore you must have received my several letters together with Mr Pope's . Mr. Masons wagon has not yet been over — You will probably hear something of the awful calamity which befell our city on last Monday evening the 12th inst instant — During a thunder storm at about ½ past 4 PM — The magazine below Capitol Hill (and on a direct line with the female academy) was struck with lightening with over six hundred kegs of powder in it — the concussional was awfull awful and about fifty house were entirely demolished or rendered useless in the immediate vicinity and a great many others' badly damaged and not one in city that did not receive some hurt — There were four persons killed and many seriously injured, how many I do not know — It seems a miracle that hundreds were not instantly killed ½ and had it happened when people were out of their house's, no doubt the destruction to life would have been great — The Female Academy was badly riddled and no one seriously hurt — All the partitions that were made of laths and plastering were thrown down and I suppose every window in the house — broken to pieces

Our house suffered very much also — every window in the end next towards the Academy — Kitchen included were smashed all to pieces and all the others but one had glass broken out — The transom over the front door, and the pieces at each side of the doors were blown out but not broken — the steeples staples that fastened the bell wire were all forced out — Some of the plastering in Amy's room fell down — all the doors in the house were forced open and some split — the rafters where they were joined at the top of the ell of the house were riven assunder asunder at least three inches Jane Smiths Band box had the lid thrown off and her bonnet thrown out — Some of the broken glass was so finely powdered that it looked like it had been pulverized in a mortar — Rose received several cuts by the glass on one arm hand and shoulder — Mary had her comb broken which saved her head, and received a few scratches in her left hand — Sally was in the kitchen under the table which saved her and was the only one about the house who screamed — As soon as her Mother reached her she immediately asked "Ma is God in the house I don't want him to thunder any more" So it is we should be very thankful for our preservation amid so much danger ⁁ and destruction Little Mary Hamilton was with us was very much alarmed but not hurt — I was

was at the Nashville Inn in the parlor conversing with Mr & Mrs Donegan of Huntsville and we thought the Inn was struck with lightning and so did every one else think of their house — It is impossible for me to give you anything like a discription description of the extent of damage done — I enclose you the description by the "Whig" We are all well and Mary joins me in love to you, and regards to all of our Russellville friends — Write to us, and say when you are coming home — Mrs. Gustavus Henry of at Clarksville is at Jno John P Erwins Mary and myself are going out to see her this evening at three Oclock. Mrs Pope Amy & Jane wish to be remembered to you Sally says you must bring her a doll and says she does not want to hear any more thunder to tear down our house — Since writing the above I have understood that two persons who were wounded have died; making the number six — Mr Shanklands house was completely torn to pieces by timbers and stones, the furniture broken to pieces, and not one hurt. So soon as I learn it was the magazine I left my company at the Inn and went home in the rain in a hurry and was greatly relieved when I found no one killed or maimed — I write in a hurry
