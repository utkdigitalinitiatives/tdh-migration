Masonic University Sept September 23. Dear Sir Your son William having returned to Clarksville for the purpose of entering the University I deem it my duty to inform you of his position so that you may advise us of your wishes as regards his future course of studies. You are awa aware that last year he by abscense absence , negligence & other causes did not accomplish the required course in that class and was indulged until this session to make up his deficiency. On his return here I found that he had failed to comply with this requisition I had a long conversation with him last week in which I stated that he might if he wished, by double exertion to regain his position to regain the good opinion of his teachers; and the friends of the College study partly in the Freshman & partly in the sophmore sophomore and that I would reduce the complete course required in the Freshman Mathem atics to the smallest amount required to understand the rest of the course. If this is your wish he shall have this indulgence granted If you would prefer for him a selected course and give up the idea of graduation he can join any class he is qualified to enter I considered it my duty to set before him plainly & clearly that whilst it would be our duty to aid him in advancing to a honorable position yet we were compelled to exercise towards him a strict and stern discipline. We felt that last year we had yielded too much to our feelings of delicacy towards you in not reporting to you promptly his errors; we are now compelled to pursue our simple line of duty in reporting to you promptly any evidences of want of study or other violations of regulation comm which may come to our knowledge. I have also placed before him inducement to conduct himself in such a manner as to merit the good

f aculty. If he does not avail himself of the present occassion occasion diligently I should consider it impossible for us to do thing more and would then recommend that you place him elsewhere. He has now a boarding house in which I think he will be less exposed to the temptations which surrounded him last year. You will receive from me a report showing his advance & conduct at the end of this quarter. Your son has been here one week to day without entering the college the regulation forbid him remaining in town unless he does regularly enroll himself before the end of the week, As however he informs me that he has written to you with regard to the classes he wishes to enter I have determined to suspend the regulation for the present until he receives an answer from you. I confess to you that I am anxious very anxious about him & that I hardly know what to advise with regard to his studies. We will do all we can to advance his interest in our power. The respect entertained to you personally both by the Teachers and Trustees make us desire your sons welfare. Very truly & fraternally Wm A Forbes Prsd President pro term To Adam Ferguson Fergusson Esq Esquire }
