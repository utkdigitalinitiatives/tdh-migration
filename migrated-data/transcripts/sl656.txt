Columbia Te Tennessee June 24 38 1838 Dear Sir__ I have been requested by the officers and men composing the newly organized Corpe. styled the "Columbia Blues" to address a letter to you with a request to know what prospects there are for their muskets being furnished from the public arsenal of the state; which, if you can spare a few moments, you will please answer. Our company numbers some forty three or four, and are tolerably well organized and drilled and all we now want is muskets, which I trust you will grant us. We could get 4 names for the purpose of drawing arms muskets if we chose; but I suggested the propriety of asking for no more muskets than we wanted, as the balance would be wanted, or destroyed, or lost I know that the state guards at nashville have drawn muskets twice or three times, from the Penitentiary, and they have never numbered more than 35 or 40 men, except when they went out campaigning.__ By sending us an order for 45 muskets on Mr. McIntosh, you will very much oblige, on behalf of the corps, Yours respectfully J.H. Thompson His Excellency N Newton . Cannon, Gov Governor . of Tennessee P.S Post Script .__ If you grant our request, you will oblige us by enclosing an order on Mr Mister McIntosh for the army, and we will forthwith send a wagon for them
