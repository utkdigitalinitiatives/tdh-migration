Jan January 17th 1832 Dear Andrew I am in debt to you one or two letters and would have written several days since but having nothing of importance to communicate I have deferred writing until now. In fact there is a complete dearth of news here and of course there is nothing to make a letter interesting- I ought to have mentioned to you that the Trainer which you have employed being a free man of colour color , will not be allowed to remain in the state longer than twenty days. In obediance obedience to an act of the last legislature, **see bottom which act you no doubt have seen. I mentioned to you in my last letter something about the loan of money &c et cetera I have lately made such arrangements as I shall not need the loan if one should offer which I expect is very doubtful- I have sold out one half of my ** in relation to free negroes Bettie M Donelson papers.

2 interest in the Craighead farm to Mr McLemore and he has already sent up a large force and we will crop it in partnership this year and next year we are going to establish a bagging factory on a large scale, as we are convinced that more money can be made at that business than any other that can be followed. Mr McLemore is yet considerably in debt But is working through gradualy gradually under heavy fire from all quarters. His resources are large and I have not seen him in better spirits. My means are more than sufficient under late arrangements to liquidate all all my debts- But I cannot calculate upon much help in the money way immediately from McLemore- But our joint forces will be large and I shall put in 200 and odd acres in cotton this year. I am now satisfied that my own crop of cotton will neat net me from 25 to 30,000 lbs picked cotton

While on the subject of cotton I will say something to you about yours- You will make between 40 and 50,000 seed cotton certain there is a good deal yet to pick out- I understand that Mr Steel Steele has refused to gin it for you- I have said to your overseer that I will gin it free of expense if he will wait until I get mine out of the way or he can carry it to my gin at the Craighead place and gin it immediately as will best suit his convenience. Holtzclaw is gradualy making a complete change in every thing and I have no hesitation in saying that he will do well- His system of management is complete- His attention is given to every thing- You have to buy meat and he is afraid that forage will be scarce with him- But I believe you have made error enough- These little expenses of buying meat &c is a considerable draw back from the profits of the farm &c I hear of no complaints from your negroes and I have

4 no doubt but they will be well satisfied with him- I have received your letter returning me the unlucky order from Steel on Uncle. I do not know when I have been more mortified than I have been about this same order- I must request you sir as a favor to show this part of my letter to Uncle Jackson , As I want him to know the truth about this whole affair. Mr Steele was anxious to purchase a horse of mine for which he offered me $115 in cash I refused, my price being $125= But when I found out that I had to send on money to cottons heirs I told Steele that I would accept his offer of $115 cash which he agreed to do- He then told me that Uncle was owing him more than that amount for his years wages previously to the time we traded and that if I would accept an order on him it would answer one the same pur-

You know the situation of the order when it came to me returned- so far all was right- I was satisfied that Steel had deceived me in Uncle owing him anything- I presented the order to Mr Josiah Nichol president of the United States Bank- and instead of paying it like a man and an old friend of Gen General Jackson- what do you think he did- he refused to pay it upon the ground that Gen Jackson was in his debt- that he would have nothing to do with it- that he did not know why Gen Jackson would draw upon him when there was no money in his hands to pay it with and cast out a good Bettie M Donelson Papers

6 many reflections- spoke of an ill natured letter he had recieved received from Gen Jackson- This is poor satisfaction to me to give this information- I would freely have given up the order If I had only had the presence of mind to have called for Gen Jacksons accounts and have paid off all that he owed from it him. I told Mr Nichol I did not want the money then that when the cotton ** was sold that he could take off so much of Steels wages- and he refused to have any thing to do with it I parted from him with this remark "That it was very strange to me that Gen Jackson would be giving orders on people that would not be them" I then stepped around to the ware house to enquire if steels wages had been paid and met with H. Hill and ascertained that they had not- I then communicated to Hill the situation of the order and he made this remark that he [ Stokly Donelson ] ** which had already been shipped on the St Steam Boat Nashville
