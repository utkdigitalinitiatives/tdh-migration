3 Springs June 2nd 1816 Dear Sir From Reynoldsburgh Mr Mister Dickson Esq. & myself wrote you jointly and inclosed a plan of the road, that we have lately surveyed__ When we arrived in the nation the chiefs were collecting in a grand counsel, principally occasioned by a letter received from the Chief of the Cherokee nation inviting a deputation from the Chickasaw Chocktaw Creek & Cherokee Nations to meet at turkey town on the 27th Ult Ultimo . (I believe was the time) in order to settle their boundaries &C etcetera __ I attended as a spectator, the agent Colo Colonel Cocke produced a letter from the secretary of war making propositions for the purchase of the lands belonging to that nation North of the Tennessee river , they appeared much dissatisfied with that part of the letter that wished a purchase I think the proposition would have been better recd received had they not been so much dissatisfied with the line run by Genl General Coffee dividing their lands from those of the Creeks obtained by Genl Coffee Jackson's treaty. In counsel they had two depositions read which the agent had obtained (I believe Terry & McGee) which as well as I recollect proves that the line ought to be run from a small Creek above the Mussel Shoals , to flat rock (or stone) thence to the head of Black Warrior and down that stream. The secretarys secretary's letter stating that if Genl General . Coffees Coffee's line was not correct, it should be Corrected appeared to give Satisfaction__ I applied individually to some of the Chiefs relative to the Saline, on lands. They appeared very averse to leasing or selling saying

that they would say nothing respecting the Salt works untill until Coffees line was decided, that they only done one business at a time__ I had the pleasure of meeting Majr Major . Thompson & W. Robertson who had letters recommending them to the agent from you I used my endeavor with them to obtain the object__ the agent was not favourable favorable to the plan alledging alleging that their dislike to Genl. Coffees line made it an unfavourable unfavorable time to prevent the proposition; However I wrote for those gentlemen you had recommended propositions which they delivered to Majr. Glover a principal Chief who promised to present it for the Consideration of the other Chiefs__ I think it probable that when the line business is complete, if commissioners were appointed by the Genl. government, that the saline lands be procured, which would be of great advantage to the Western states & territories__ I am Sir with Esteem Yr. Obt. Sert Your Obedient Servant . Thos Thomas Johnson His Excellency Joseph McMinn Esqr Esquire
