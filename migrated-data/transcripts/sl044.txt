Washington March 3rd 1833 — My Dr Dear Sir Yours of the 14th ult. ultimo was duly received — The Chickesaw Chickasaw treaty was ratified by the Senate on the 1st instant, and on yesterday your name as Surveyor was presented to them — with a receiver & Register. I was apprehensive that as you were not an inhabitant of the state of Mississippi that you would be rejected, as they had rejected Gwinn , then Genl General B. Coleman , and lastly Mr Williford as register for Mount Solcis . As I had anticipated you were rejected, I then sent a nomination communication, that until their resolution was recended recinded , concluding from their various rejections of men, fit, honest, capable, & every way beyond exception, that the only ground for rejection must be, because they were not citizens of Mississippi, & this being an encroachment on the Executive discretion in appointments as prescribed in the Constitution, that I should not present any more nomenations nominations to them for office, in Mississippi, untill until that resolution was recended recinded — The resolution was recended recinded , but having reported your rejection, it could not be reconsidered without unanimous consent. I was then

determined to renounciate Gwinn , as receiver, which I did, and he was approved, which gave me a triumph over the factious Senate headed by Poindexter — but without benefit to you under the rule before mentioned, as your ⁁ case could not be reconsidered. Although I have obtained a triumph over Poindexter, still I am sorely mortified at your defeat — but remembering for the present the old 'adage' that what cannot be cured, must be endured, still ⁁ you may rest ing well assured that no opportunity will be omitted that can be embraced with propriety, to promote your interest. Congress adjourned about day light this morning, and I am not very well, and have to prepare for my inaguration inauguration tomorrow, & can only add, that your friend Genl General Coffee was with me at the Capital Capitol last night, and is truly disgusted with the scenes, & mortified at your rejection. With my love to Betsy & the children the good old lady & all my connection with my congratulations to the new married pair I remain yr your friend Andrew Jackson R. Robert J. Chester Esqr. Esquire
