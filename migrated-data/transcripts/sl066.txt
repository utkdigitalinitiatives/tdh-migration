Pittsburgh 1st Jany January 1808 Gentlemen I received yours of the 23rd of November requesting me to recollect particularly the conversation that passed between Mr. Hunt and me about your Cotton Bailing of which I have the most perfect recollection on the 8th day after I left your place I called on Mr Hunt in Lexington & delivered him your Letter which he red read and then told me he could furnish you with what you wanted in case you would pay the money I told him I should not promise, that as I was not so directed but that he might write to you by the first mail on subject which he said he would do he asked me if I thought you were good for the mony money I told him I had no doubt of that, he said if you would agree to pay the money in Lexington that he could have some of the Bailing ready in a short time, so that no positive agreement took place between Mr Hunt and me further than what I have stated the Memorandom Memorandum you gave me â€” I cannot find at present, but if I shoud should find it I will send you a Copy of it, what I have stated I am ready to make oath of at any time. I wish you to write me if Mr Coleman pays our money when it is due if you have an opportunity you will be so good as to send it, we are your sincere Friends.
