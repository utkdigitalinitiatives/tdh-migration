Bellemont Nov. November 16th 1846 My dear bro. brother Taylor you told me in Somerville I think some time after J. J. Alison's trial at Wesly what he said to you at your house respecting my character, viz. to wit that I was a very corrupt, rotton rotten -hearted man this conversation took place at the time, when he informed you what the Stewards had done at Cloyton-Camp meeting. you agreed to give me your certificate, if I thought it necessary. brother Brock was at my house the other day ‚ÅÅ I told him that I could get you to certify to the above and I promised to have it at Conference. it is important I think for me to have your certificate. will you then be so good as to send me by bro. Smith in writing, as near as you can recollect, what J.J. Alison did say to you in disparagement of my character. be particular to state in your certificate, when and where this conversation took place. Comply with the above and oblige yours &c et cetera A.W. Littlejohn
