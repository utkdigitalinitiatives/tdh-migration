Columbia Tennessee 13th Nov. November 1842 My dear Father, I received yours of the 5th Ult. Ultimo with very great pleasure, and hasten to answer it, as some time has elapsed since I last wrote, knowing that you would have an opportunity of hearing from me of Gov. Governor Polk , I thought it not necessary to write before. I saw him a day or two before before before he left, he said that he would call to see me, and carry a letter, but I suppose that he either was in too great a hurry or forgot it. You cannot imagine how much disappointment I felt when Cousin Sam received your letter saying that you could not make it convenient to visit me at the time you intended. I had promised myself the happiness that saturday , (for you remember it is the day that you told me to look for you) of seeing you and hearing from your own mouth how all at home were. I begin to feel impatient to see you. so do, as soon as you return from Memphis , come up to see me.

I am happy to hear that my Brothers are so well supplied with their winter clothing; indeed I have experienced eneough enough of my dear Aunts kindness myself to know that they will supply as much as is in their power the dreadful loss of our Beloved Mother. I feell feel very grateful to them, and always shall for the great interest that they have taken in us. I have the pleasure of informing ⁁ you of the arrival of another little stranger in Cousin Elens family. he about three weeks old, they have named him Sam, he is a very sweet little baby. Cousin Jane started to Arkansas last week. We all miss her company very much. she will not return until next summer. Tell Sister that I shall answer her kind letter very soon, and that I hope she will continue to write me often, as you and her are the ⁁ only ones of my relations that write to me at all. I think that you ought to write me very often. Indeed I have become weary of asking Brother John . Give my best love to all my relations, and kiss little Willie B — and Sam . Your ever affectionate Daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester P. S. Post Script I have sent to Nashville by Cousin Knox for a Shawl. Cousin Jane purchased a very pretty one for 8$. Mine will be of the same kind. I tell you that, for fear that you would bring one. I should be pleased if you could bring me a nice Black Muslin de Lane, when you come, get it in Nashville that is I believe the only article that I shall need this winter. I have concluded to weare wear my old Bonnit Bonnet , & get a new one next
