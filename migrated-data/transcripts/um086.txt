Columbia Tennessee January 28th 1843 My dear Papa, Again I am disappointed in not seeing you, indeed I had expected you with so much certainty that I could scarcely reconcile myself to the idea of your not coming and have determined not look for you until I see you, which I hope will be in June. Cousin Sam let me read your letter, that he received last week he laughed at me very much about the kiss that you sent or at least in trying to get it. The Examination commenced on yesterday morning which was Friday & will continue until Tuesday evening today and tomorrow omitted of course. The lower classes only, were examined yesterday. The more advanced are reserved for the two last days. I think that I am very well prepared I have two very pretty peices pieces of music to play at the Concert. There will be three or four Graduates this Winter, or account of the young ladies who live in the South, they could not return in the Summer. I wish that you would write to

me, if it is your wish that I shall study French next session. We have an excellent Teacher. I am very anxious to take Guitar lessons, by taking one lesson on the Piano and two on the Guitar in a week, will have to pay exactly the same price as if I were to take whole lessons on the piano, and I think that I should learn equally as much. If it is not perfectly agreeable to you, I should rather not commence. They sell very cheap. Mr Smith has very handsome ones for $25. You must excuse my short letters until after this Examination is over, then I intend writing you very long ones. Tell Rachel Trigg I was very much pleased to receive her letter. Kiss Dear little Sam , and the children, and Give my love to my relations. Yours affectionately M. J. Mary Jane Chester P. S. Post Script Please send me some money in your next. I wish to take lessons on the Guitar, more on account of my voice than any thing else, for the Lady who teaches upon that instrument has a very superior voice and is considered an excellent teacher.
