Knoxville August 16th 1820 Sir Believing myself entitled to a Life estate reservation, under Jacksons Treaty, and confermed confirmed by that, concluded by yourself at Washington City . I applied at the Cherokee agency, on the 21st July 1819; and and obtained a Certificate, for one, Situated at or near the mouth of Citico Creek; to which place I immediately removed — feeling myself perfectly safe in the possession of it, I have laid out considerable terms of money in improvements &C et cetera .

Colonel Meigs cheerfully granted the certificate To become the trumpeter of my own fame or to ask for indulgences to which I was not intitled entitled would to me be extremely disagreeable to the Latter I cannot decend descend and it is with
