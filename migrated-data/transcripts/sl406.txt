Hazlewood Feb February 9 1839 Dear brother I recived received your letter last saturday and fully intended to have answered it before this, but several little things have occured occurred to prevent me on every day I was rejoiced to hear that you had arrived safe and ind in improved health your letter was short with not many particulars in it you told me of marriages and of the death of Sarah Hicks which I was sorry to hear but did not say what was the cause of her death; and of the birth of Susan Wooldrige 's son, but not his age nor his name, all such little things are generally considered the cream of correspondence with ladies, you know our life is composed of trifles. You say Paris is " meloncholly melancholy dull" perhaps what I heard a gentleman observe not long ago is true, that all Paris was moved away and the town was sown down in oats, if it should ever be the case, the place where it once stood would always be hallowed ground to me, there is not a scene, or a street, nor an old house about the town, but what linked with some happy rememberence remembrance of the past that cannot easily be forgotten. I went down home in october but did not stay out at my Fathers but one night, they had the hooping whooping cough among the negroes very bad and I was afraid for my children to take it so late in the year I went to Aunt Watsons Watson's and staid stayed a few days and mama and the children come up and staid with me, I was very sorry I could not remain any longer I go so seldom but I could not stay with

Aunt Watson, you know her failing. Capt Captain Watson has built an adition addition to his house and finished it off very hansomely handsomely with a nice portico in front, I did not know the place it was so much changed. I have not received a letter from home since I was there but I have heard by a gentleman that was at my Fathers about a month ago, he said they are building in town and expected to move very soon, he said mama told him that my Father had divided out his negroes among his children and that if I would come down there this spring she would give a maid, whether it be true or not I do not know. Mr Mister Finiman myself and both my children are all very well, Laura can talk very plain and Junius is beging begging to step about a little and is I think very fine smart looking fellow every body says he is just like you so you can judge of his beauty that You must come down soon and see us all yourself it has been nearly a year now since you were here. give my best love to Susan and Mr Mister Wooldrige and tell Susan I congratulate her on the birth of her son and sincerely hope that she may be fortunate enough to raise him give my love to every person that remembers me. write soon and tell if you can when you expect to visit us. Your Sister M. Finiman
