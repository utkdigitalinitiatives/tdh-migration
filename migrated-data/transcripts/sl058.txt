Cabarrus County North Carolina Deer Dear Sir Mr George Calhoon Calhoun has been to see me for the purpose of knowing what can be done relative to his claim of 350 acres of land for which he has a bond executed by my Brother Samuel to John Wilson to be laid out of a thousand acre tract which land is now found to be in Williamsoon Williamson County Tennessee Now Sir I have every reason to believe that bond was given with a just intention for the performance as practicable it appears that older claims do cover a consider able portion of it Mr Calhoon Calhoun has manifested a disposition to be satisfyed satisfied with his proportionate share of the safe lan land and has provided accordingly — How far those men may be considered as just and impartial who were concerned and appointed by order of Court to lay off and divide the land in their own neighbourhood neighborhood I know not but common report speaks well of them here as far as I have any

knowledge of their characters for this reason I would ⁁ rather abide by their decison decision than be at the trouble of doing the works all over again — When I admit that my Brother Samuels Bond was given for a just consideration and Mr Calhoon Calhoun has shown no dispostion disposition to claim any more than his proportionate share of the safe land and if he can remove any do doubt that may arise whether he came honestly by the bond (for my part I have none) I cannot see where a just cause of Lawsuit will lye lie — I hold that Mr Calhoon Calhoun ought in Justice to pay his proportionate share of the office expences expenses taxes &c and et cetera that have accrued while the land was common between him & me — With respect to that part of the land which has been covered by older titles I am of the opinion that Mr Calhoon Calhoun would not oug was bound in justice to loose lose his proportionate share — The bond was given to execute a deed of three hundred and fifty acres of land out of a specifyed specified tract of one thousand acres of land viz from a tract of 1008 acres of land entered in John Armstrongs office by said Harris No Number 1804: I would ask in this case admit that the whole of this 1000 acres had been covered by Older State grants how would Samuel Har

ris or his kin have made a little for any part of it or how could Mr Calhoon Calhoun claiming by virtue of that bond compel the heirs of Samuel Harris to do a thing which in its nature is morally impossible. But this difficulty has been removed by the conduit of Mr Calhoon Calhoun he has set up his claim for no more thanks proportionate share of the safe land — he proposes further that if any doubt should still exist in your mind of an injurrous injurious partiallity partiality having been practised by those men who divid ⁁ ed the land that you are perfectly welcome to choose any other five free holders to lay it off again and he well abide by the award if you I should think that necessary to be done (which I hope you will not) I hold that Mr Calhoon Calhoun ought to be confined to his share of the safe land which he ⁁ has voluntarily done and which I have a right to expect where a piece of business can be setled settled amicably what is the rise of going to row ? Any person that pleases can break into law but it is not every one that can buc

break out of law when he pleases As I had no kind of secrets to communicate I have with a spirit of candeur candor and love of peace shown Mr Calhoon Calhoun this letter in order that you might both understand my sentiments precisely in the same point of view.
