Carthage May 30th 1846 Mr Fergusson Sir Having used your Uniform coat a few days and finding it fits me I conclude to take it with me. I expected to have gone to see you about it had you been at home. but I learned you would be absent until tomorrow which time would in all probability be too late for me In using it I found it contained a (letter or at least a piece of paper with your name upon it but have not examined it to see what was the contents) which I enclose to you Respectfully C. Charles W. Dixon
