Highawassee Garrison Jany January . 29th 1817 Colo. Colonel Return J. Meigs Dear Sir, I feel verry very much embarrassed on account of the probability of my being disappointed in my contract with Vann , I have made every arrangement which was necessary on my part to fullfill meet my engagement with him, a failure at this time would I will assure you injure me verry considerably I have understood that it has been alleged by some of the Indians that I done them injustice in issuing whilst acting as contractor, This I presume can be no solid objection it can be nothing more than a protest, because the whole of my conduct was well known to them previous to my contract with McNair & Brown , nothing can have transpired since that time to lessen their confidence in me. I am strongly inclined to believe that this tale is not on foot for the purpose of susstanting me in this business, Indeed I have just learned that Mr. Robt Robert . Gambell is using every exertion to obtain the place over my head, contrary to every principle of Justice & common honesty. You Sir are the only person I have to look up to in this trying situation. I hope and trust that you will not fail to befriend me_ Accept the assurances of my esteem David Parkhill
