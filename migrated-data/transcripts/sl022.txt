New Jackson PaperA gentleman of this city is desirous of engaging a partner of talents and character to aid him in the publication of a daily newspaper in this place, to be conducted on republican principles, and to be devoted to the support of the next Administration, and, at the same time, to oppose the selfish views of the unprincipled faction who are struggling to make the ⁁late victory of the People the source of their own private aggrandisementaggrandizement and enduement. As a publication of   this kind, emanating from the Seat of Government, is at present a diseduatum,  and is anxiously  wished for by all who believe politics, and sound reason, and common decency to be compatible with each other, it is superfluous to say that the inducements it offers, to a suitable person, are very great; and if he entertains an elevated opinion of the good sense of the people, and their ability to descriminatediscriminate between the boisterous demagogue and their real friend, he can have no doubt of the most unexampled success. To prevent unnecessary trouble, the applicant whose character principles and character can bear the following test, will be preferred; and none, varying much from it, need apply, as the advertiser has noneither a desire to follow in the wake of others ⁁nor interfere with theirexisting plans. nor to  on  did already 1. The successful applicant must be a republican in theory and practice; and, in order to prove that they ⁁ his principles are more deeply rooted than his tongue, will have to produce evidence not only that he has written, talked, and disclaimed about "liberty" and the "rights of the People," but that he has never, in private life, as an employer or the head of a family, abused his brief authority, or attempted to exercise an unwarrantable and despotic sway over the only portion of the People over whom he had ⁁any control. Positive evidence on this head is absolutely indispensable, and must emanate from  those only who have been, or now are, by chance or fortune, subjected to his will; for he who maltreats his own household, and acts the tyrant in miniature over the unfortunate, deserves to be treated with ineffable scorn and contempt when he vapoursvapors about "liberty," and the "rights of the People." It is worse than folly to suppose that such a man can be a true patriot, andor, disinterestedly, devote his time and talents to the welfare of a whole nation. Therefore, in the absence of all evidence of thispractical republicanism, what he has said or sung on the topic will be of no avail; for a truly good man will no more make a continual parade of his virtue and patriotism, than a virtuous matron would of her chastity and fidelity.2. If the applicant should have edited a paper during the past political campaign, he must produce evidence of his modesty and manliness when triumphant, and ⁁of  his respect for the dignity of the People. If he attributes the late triumph to the reality with which the People  were led by him, rather than to their own moods,determined spirit his will or  vanity will not is too preposterous to suit the views of the advertisers. If he has attempted, to act as the peoples agent with a view of gathering, for himself and his faction, the harvest which they People had sownsewn, his application will be rejected, and himself treated as spu subjected to the penalties ⁁ usually inflicted on ⁁suporterssupporters and the spurious representative of a rich ⁁great inheritance. Finaly His actions must His conduct since the election must have been such as to prove, that he did not consider "party the madness of many for the benefit of a few."3. In his new vocation, he must not attempt to palm himself off to the President elect as the People, nor attempt to dictate to him in their name. 4. He must not be a man so contemptible where he is known, as to hope nothing from the influence of his personal character. Such men are complete nuisances in any country where they write the power of the press. Like sharpers, they sow dissensions among the People, persuade one portion of them that they are the natural enemies of the other,  and make them quarrel with each other, to enable themselves the more easily to rob and pick their pockets. If the party gains the ascendancy to which, by choice or accident, they attach themselves, they claim for the triumphant opinions the rewards which belong only to character and virtue; because they can only hope for success, ⁁ by stifling the reason common sense and reason of mankind, and exciting their passions. By these means, they ⁁frequently float on the torrent of popular fury; and, when it recedes, their neighbors are astonished to see them, snughigh and dry, in elevated  stations so far ⁁ elevated above their native element. With nothing little or nothing to risk, it is no wonder that such desperadoes are ever ready to embark in any party enterprise, provided they are afterwards permitted to scramble, (with the modestmeritorious and patriotic, who are always most diffident) for the rewards of success. In short, they are so convinced that no revolution of the wheel of fortune can sink them lower, and so envious of others withal, that they would consider even a deluge a blessing, if it could only destroy the land marks of property and ⁁the gradations of character, and permitted themselves to sail, unmarked and unmolested, over the general ruin. 5. He must be opposed to the scalping system of editing and governing; and be no advocate for proscription in this free land, whilst he affects to lament and shed crocodile tears over persecution, for opinion's sake, in Europe and elsewhere.All letters, postpaid, and addressed through the P. O. post office to A. G. will be attended to.
