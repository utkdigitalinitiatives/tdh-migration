Knoxville October 9th 1803 Sir After this note I will bid you adieu, it being the last you will receive from me on the point of honour the subject of my first note to you dated the first Instant— From the Tenor of yours of the third Instant in answer to my note of the morning of the same day, I did believe that all that sermounted surmounted to be done, was for our friends immediately to point out the place to which we were instantly to repair, and the satisfaction required in my note of the second was immediately to be given—as I had named to you in my note of the third, that unless you did meet me between then & the hours of four Oclock in the evening of the same day— or set out immediately to the Indian boundary line a place named by me (to remove your squeamish fears) that I would advertise you as a coward and poltroon— but Judge my astonishment, (when it was stated to me by my friend after application to Capt Captain Sparks your friend to put the time and proceed to a place to be named agreeable to your note) that in express contradiction thereto he stated, that you had instructed him not to name a day sooner than the Eight instant— I directed my friend to state to him expressly, if he did not agreable agreeable to your note, immediately proceed to name time and place, that after four oclock I would advertise you as a coward and poltroon and that censure might attach to him, as he was by your

note authorised authorized to act— he replied, he hoped I would not advertise you, but if I did he could not help it, that he was freely pursuing your instructions of which I have no doubt as I believe him to be a man of truth— I then had a right to expose you— I thought I would that evening post you as a coward— but to leave you no subterfuge, I determined to wait to the Eighth the day of your choice, on the seventh Instant Capt Captain White waited on Capt Captain Sparks your friend to be informed of your determination— and did emphatically state to you thro through Capt Captain Sparks, that we had waited your own time, and expected you had instructed him to state, that on the morning of the Eight, that you would be ready to meet me in the vicinity of Knoxville , or be ready to set out to the Indian boundary line, there to satisfy my demand— The answer was no arrangement yet made not still ready— Capt Captain Sparks was again told to state to you, unless you did meet me on the Eighth instant, you would be posted as a coward and poltroon— on the Eighth an answer was given to my friend Capt Captain A. White that you could not see me untill until the Gosmettce business was over— these delays I well thought were intended as a mere subterfuge for your cowardice you will recollect, that you on the first instant in the publick public streets of Knoxville appeared to part for the combat, you ransacked the vocabulary of vulgarity for insulting and blackguard Expressions— You

without provocation made the attack, and in an ungentlemanly manner took the sacred name of a lady in your polluted lips, and dared me publickly publicly to challenge you— and ever since you gave the insult, has cowardly evaded an interview you on that day appeared to court — you ought at least before you make a premeditated attack to be ready to repair the injury at the call of the injured— I have waited your time, I have named the indian Indian boundary line, to prevent you from having any subterfuge—to which you agreed— all in vain— cowardice is now your only shield, to that you have resorted, and as you will not give me that redress in the field, that the injury you have done requires— and as your old age protects you from that Chastisement you merrit merit — the justice I owe to myself and country urges me to unmask you to the world in your true colours; In the Gazzet Gazette of Monday Inst— Instant I have spoke for a place in the paper for the following advertisement— and I have named publickly publicly that you are the greatest coward I ever had anything to do with— The advertisement as follows, To all who shall see these presents Greeting—Know yea that I Andrew Jackson, do pronounce, publick public , and declare to the world, that his Excellency John Sevier Esqr Esquire , Captain General and commander in chief of the cond and Naval forces within the State of Tennessee is a base coward and poltroon, He will
