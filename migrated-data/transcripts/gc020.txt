Alexa Alexandria ( La Louisiana ) 5th March 1833 Dear Cousin Yours esteemed favour was recd received by last mail and was much pleased to hear of the good health of all particularly the improving situation of cousin Martha, but you were truely truly unfortunate in losing your fine son, though it is a natural consequence for those who have to lose we have been so unfortunate as to lose both of ours. We are entirely destitude destitute of any news that would be interesting to you we have so far escaped the cholerea cholera and in fine health and spirits we forget our past misfortunes and look to the future for better success we always feel as proud as the devil here untill until about July, Aug August . & Septr September . We are then for a while obliged to crouch under and beg for quarters until the dead are all buried, after which we meet and take a glass to the memory of our departed frinds friends talk of our crops and wives and resume our usual course in life in short we are the happiest souls in the world we live to try to make money and be happy and die only for want of breath. The cholerea spread considerably on the Mississippi but has by expirince experience become perfectly managi a ble and no great deal dreaded.

We have had a great deal of bad weather which has retarded us very much in preparing for a new crop particularly, as my place is entirely new and immense labor required to put it in order. John is very industrious but yet little acquanted acquainted with our mode of doing business I have to day commenced planting my corn and have thene then all my cotton land to prepare. I have just returned from N New Orleans cotton is ranging from 8 to 12 cents have sold about three fourths my crop which was about one hundred thousand pounds gin cotton but will not bring a high price in consequence of the out season by which the quality was materially injured though think it will neat net me after paying freight insurance, drayage, storage & commission, nine thousand dollars though that is far beyond an average crop I think it probable that I shall go to Carolina next summer but it is uncertain whether I shall come through Tennessee or not as I shall be in a hurry and may go the most expeditious route which will be by way of N New Orleans & Mobile but should certainly return through Tennessee where I would once more have the pleasure of embrasing embracing my old friends. My wife joins me in love to cousin Martha, children and all our relations and enquiring friends. Your relative & Friend. Tho. Thomas O. Moore If I go to Carolina I will write you previous to my departure
