Alexandria 8th May 1833 Dear Cousin I leave here tomorrow on the steam boat Lioness for Neue New Orleans on my way to North Carolina shall go from N.O. New Orleans to Mobile then take the stage to Fayettville where I expect to arrive by the 20th unless detained in the city longer than I anticipate which I hope will not be the case as the cholera is raging there to a considerable extent, we have thus far escaped that dreadful malady in our section of country though frequently brought to this place by the boats. I shall have in company with me two other gentlemen who are going on also to purchase negroes Negroes and think it more than probable that I shall return by Murfreesboro particularly if there should be no cholerea cholera in the river, though if there should be shall continue my trip by land to the mouth of red river , write me at Lampton court house the price of negroes in Tenn Tennessee . they are I am informed very high in Carolina Virginia & Maryland . We are remarkably backward in our crops caused by the incessant raining we are just getting in a fine way of scraping and our cotton looks well notwithstanding the wet weather, and the prospects for good prices are no doubt better than they have been for several years unless some unforeseen mixture breaks out in Europe an event which we have right to expect at this time their markets can nothing like be amply supplied.

from the last years crop and Neue New Orleans will have less cotton on hand the first of June than there was in market on the first of Aug.t August last year, consequently the market must open early and at a fair demand next fall, I have planted a large crop for my force with the expectation that the negroes I purchase will assist in gathering I am confident I lost seventy or eighty bales of cotton last year by not being able to gather it in time. John is quite awkward in the mode of planting here though very industrious and his ideas are good and will make a good plantation if he can have his health. Thos Thomas Butler is in tolerable health only is determined on coming to Tenn. Tennessee after this year to remain. John is practising physic physics and doing well. My wife and John joins in my love to cousin Martha and children and to all our relations and enquiring frinds friends also accept our best wishes for your happiness & prosperity through this life and the one without end Write to me in Carolina very soon Your Friend and relation Tho. Thomas O. Moore Capt. Captain T. M. King
