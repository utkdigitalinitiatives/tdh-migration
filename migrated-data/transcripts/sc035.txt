Willie Blount , Governor of Tennessee , 1809 - 1815 was a half brother to William, and like him, was born in Bertie County, North Carolina . The date of his birth is somewhat in dispute, but is about 1768 . Very little is known of his early life. He came to Tennessee 1791 and became private Secretary to Governor Wm. William Blount , which position he held until Tennessee ceased to be a territory, 1796 . When the State was organized he was elected by the Legislature one of the Superior Judges. Blount was elected three times Governor with practically no opposition. His administration covered one of the most important periods in the history of the State. During this time, 1813 , General Jackson , with his Tennessee volunteers, fought the war with the Creek Indians . To equip these soldiers, Gov. Governor Blount raised $370,000 on his own responsibility. The battle of New Orleans was fought the last year of his term of office, January 8, 1815 . The establishment of the Supreme Court, and the beginning of the State Bank System, also belong to this period. Blount was a member of the Constitutional Convention 1835 . He died Sept. September 10, 1835 . The Legislature voted to erect a monument to his memory at Clarksville, Tennessee , where he is buried.
