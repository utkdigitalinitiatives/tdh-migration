Columbia Female Institute June 1st 1841 My Dear Mama O! I was so much delighted to receive your very affectionate letter, and also my dear Father's. You do not know how much distressed I was to hear that he had so severe an attack. Mama you know when you are at so great a distance as I am from the only Persons on earth you love, that when you hear that they are Sick, you generally imagine that they are worse than they in reality are. I am precisely that way, now I have imagined that is still very Sick although your letter assured me that he was nearly well. I do not disbeleive dibelieve your word, nor would I do it for the whole world, but I am affraid afraid that he has had a relapse since then. You desired me to tell you the Uniform of the Institute at the Examination: We are not permitted to wear any thing but white, no Embroidery, no coloured colored Ribbon but blue, no Jewelry excepting a Plain Breast Pin, and if we break any of these rules, Mr or Mrs Smith will say to the Audience that such things were positively forbidden to be worn and she will then point out the young lady who has broken them. I showed Mrs Smith

the part of your letter that you requested me to show her; She says that the white dress that I am having made now with the addition of the two that I brought with me will be a sufficient number for the Examination and Concert, I expect that I shall play the Russian Dance with Variations. I think that it is a very pretty peice piece , and Mrs Smith thinks that I play it very well. As my Books are waiting patiently for me to attend to them I must close my letter, I could say a great ⁁ deal more but time will not permit. Give my love to all my dear Aunts Uncles and Cousins, all my Brothers & sister, and to my dear dear Papa Your ever affectiont affectionate Daughter Mary Jane Chester Mrs Elizabeth Chester P. S. Post Script Mr & Mrs Smith request me to give their Respects to you and Papa and tell you that must be sure to come up to the Examination. I need not say how much I want ⁁ you to come. Tell Aunt Narcissa & Sis, and brother John that I expect we will have a very pleasant trip, but I am affraid afraid that I shall be so anxious to get home that I cannot take time to travel that far.
