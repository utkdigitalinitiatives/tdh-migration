Washington 19th Apl. April 1824 A Copy- Dear Sir, I have the pleasure to acknowledge your letter of 8th inst. instant In reply to the Several questions propounded by you, I will answer that at the time Mr John Spears visited this place place, it was certainly in Character of an Arkansas Delegate. When the inability to Come on of Takatokah who had been associated with Talonteesky as a delegate from Arkansas, was ascertained by the arrival of Talonteesky alone, it was concluded by Gov. Governor McMinn to fill the vacancy of Takatokah by the substitution of Mr. Spears who was considered as a part of the Arkansas Tribe of Cherokees . whether Spears was actually enrolled as an emigrant for Arkansas I do not now recollect_

but I do distinctly recollect that he was appointed, as a delegate from Arkansas._ Until Spears was employed at the Agency as Interpreter his residence had been at Hiawassee Highwassee old Town, and that his farm and family remained at that pace were notorious facts. Once, or oftener to my knowledge he was absent from the Agency to visit his family: and spoke to me of his farm. the place on which he resided near near the agency was the property of Mrs. Cary with whom he lived, but did not as I understood (according) to the laws of the Nation acquire Any right to it. as all property found in possession of the wife at marriage, remains in right of the wife after her marriage._ I cannot speak as to the

Compensation which Spears is alledged alleged to have received, but I have no doubt it is the fact; but this can be assertained ascertained by refering referring to documents in the War Department_ there was a small field (or what is often denominated in the west "a patch") between Mrs Carys and the Hiawassee river; but as to the extent of her improvements, they were very inconsiderable, and her Cabbins Cabins appeared very indifferent._ that Spears had any right to a reservation at that place, or at any other place within the Cherokee Nation, more than I now have, I do not believe, and I am well satisfied I have none that Mr Lewis Ross had a just and equitable right I am perfectly satisfied_. To the best of my recollection it was understood while I lived in the family of Mr. Ross that he had taken, or did intend to take his

his reservation embracing the agency, and also a ferry upon the Highwassee river near to where his farm was situated. What will be the result of the difficulty, I cannot pretend to say; but of this fact I am well satisfied_ If Mr L. Ross, does not get his reservation, as he proposed taking it under the Treaty of 1817. manifest injustice will be done to him. If Spears should receive a reservation, at any other place than Hiawassee Old Town, he will receive a benifit benefit to which he has no right under the Treaty of 1817. I have the hon honor to be yr Obt. Servt. your most Obedient Servant Signed Sam Houston Mr. John Ross .
