8th April 1820 Respected Sir I wish you to send down for me a horse &c etcetera with which I will come up. Capt Captain Eastland will accompany me. He wishes to see us together His reasons are best known to himself; but no doubt he will explain them to your satisfaction. Let the horse be left at Capt Jno Allen s cotton Factory. I would send you, but am not at liberty, having borrowed the papers, the Report of Mr Storns on the subject of the Seminole war. It is very suave _ and very masterly; but unjust. Gen General Jackson is cursed with advisors whoes whose abilities are utterly incompetent to render his character justice; and with supporters who have no conception of the era to which his fame ought to live. with respect and the most sincere friendship I am Dr Dear Sir your &c Chl Charles Cassedy Gen. J. James Winchester
