Carthage 18th July 1830 Dear Sir I adress address you upon a subject which seems to threaten to agitate the People of Smith County before long; In this I may be mistaken but if I am it will be the case of many others. It is whispered about and seem the opinion Seems to be gaining ground that our clerk of the County Court will resign his office, at the next year and two canidates candidates are already in nomination. I would here remark that I think the idea is premature and as far as my enquiries go the present clerk will be Sustained in office at least the peace of Smith County would require it. I would further remark that I would no means insinuate any thing as respectful to the present Clerk on the contrary I would like to see him Sustained Remain as he is But should it prove otherwise and a new clerk is to be elected, you with the rest of your the fellow Justices will be called upon in your official capacity to make a Suitable choice to fill his place. In doing this Your Judgement will be exercised to make a Suitable choice Judge of the deliver on the qualifications of those who may be candidates. Among those who will offer their pretentions pretensions for that High and respectable office I hold myself as one. I have been in office I have had transactions with most of the people of this county and I feel no small pride in saying that they have on all ocations occasions given me the most flattering

If in the course of your acquantance you should meet with an oppurtunity opportunity of conversing with some of the Justices of the peace upon the Subject (and I do think it necessary) you will be so kind as to mention me as a candidate. I understand the other candidates spoken of are Don C Dixon and David Greer but your own good prudence must tell y you that there will be many more. I put
