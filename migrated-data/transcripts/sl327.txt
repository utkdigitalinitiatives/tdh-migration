Washington January 24 1850 Dear Sir Enclosed you have the answer to your communication and mine in regard to the claim of the heirs of John Martin It seems utterly hopeless to press this matter as the Acts allowing double pensions never reached the case of those who claimed and recieved received under the Act of 1818 and further as Heirs under the Pension Laws are never permitted to claim under the Pension Laws except for those arrears already claimed by the Pension and only in arrear at his death by want of payment __ I did not think from my knowledge of the Pension Laws that there was any chance for this claim from the first. but for the satisfaction of those concerned I have pressed it to a hearing __ You will have read no doubt ere this reaches you the Special Message of the President in regard to the Territories. it is non committal in the extreme and shows a very un-authorized and dangerous interference on the part of Genl General Taylor in the affairs of California with a view to her erection into a State in order to avoid the question of the Wilmot proviso. In consequence of all this there is a strong majority of our Southern friends who are to vote against the admission of California as a State

I confess that this is a subject of painful reflection with me. Y are aware of my strong Southern feeling and my disposition to the South on their true interest. the action of the President too is certainly very reprehensible but how does this affect California. She has adopted a Constitution. her people are not to blame in this matter. She has judged the question of Slavery for herself and although the decision is against us & our interest. yet can we and our Friends on our ground of ntervention non intervention refuse her application for admission as a State. This is a question upon which I wish the advice of yourself and our leading Friends. talk around and write me your & their opinion immidiately immediately Yrs Yours Respectfully Andrew Ewing
