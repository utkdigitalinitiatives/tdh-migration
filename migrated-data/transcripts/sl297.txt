Gallatin 21st Nov November 1844 A. Ferguson Fergusson Esqr Esquire Dear Sir Having achi ⁁ e ved one important victory is it not well at once to begin to say the grannd grand work to which into the Democratic ranks our Congressional district? This can be done by the August election if the proper means should be forthwith adapted I am no politician nor will ⁁ I be in the state, my business being in New Orleans yet from the deep interest I feel in bringing back our patriotic state, and especially this congressional district I will take the liberty of suggesting a plan for quietly organising organizing the Democratic party before a new excitement is again ? and one of the plans I would suggest would be to get up and sustain a press in your Tenn Tennessee , or perhaps the better plan would be to quietly form operations all over your County and raise a fund in cash to procure suitable increments for ?

to wit; the Nashville union or some other good paper or the Dollar Globe. I think however the New York Plebian Plebeian considering how cheaply it is offered to club on apriations might be the best. The Plebian is ably and can be had for the merest trifle. By adapting some such plan as this and quietly handing out a paper to a Whig with a request that he would read and return the paper, it will be the means of making many converts, when a speech on politick ? would but harden them in their resistance to the Democratic creed To read at their own fireside a well written article will afford them a that they have by an impulse of their ⁁ own made the discovery of the true position of the antagonist principles of the parties. Then are both to be dictated to, and prefer if they change their possitions positions to have the credit of making the discovery themselves. The Democratic party in your County is as strong as the Whigs of and by the same with a liberal use of their means it will not require long to wheel into the Democratic ranks this District But to put this desirable object they must be waking men acting firmly

but quietly and never slumbering on their post I make this communication to you confidentially hoping you will appreciate my motion as I can have no object but an ardent desire which I know you cherish of witnessing a return of our state and especially this District to the Democratic fold And now is the time to act when there is no exciting canvas pending. Respectfully R. M Boyen
