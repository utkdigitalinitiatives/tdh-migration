March 10th 1816 His Excellency Joseph McMinn Sir I send you the best description I can get of Aaron Gladden who was committed to the Jail of Williamson county for horse stealing, and on the night of the 26th of Feby February . last, the Jail was burnt and the villain gone. It is submitted to the consideration of the executive, whether or not, it would be better to offer a reward for him, he is a man of exceeding bad character, and it has been said this is not the first charge It would be highly gratifying to the community, and particularly to me, for the villain to be taken. He is about forty years of age, dark hair, intermixed with grey, swarthy complexion, about six feet high, blue eyes, his teeth, before is worn very short and smooth; large frame, thin visage, large eye brows, and his eyes considerably sunk for a man of his age, he has a down cast villainous look and rather slow spoken. I am yrs yours . respectfully Thomas Ridley Shff Sheriff of Williamson county Ridley
