Nashville June 26th 1832 Genl General Wm William Polk Raleigh Dear Sir Yours of the 12th Inst Instant reached me this evening The absence of Robt Robert Woods , who is on a visit to the East, but expected home daily, prohibits me from giving you very minute information_ He has been actively engaged in investigating the affair of the Bank and will resume the labor as soon as he returns. and I am satisfied will not withhold his exertions untill until every thing is fairly probed. He possesses the capability, & being deeply interested he has the motive to pursue the subject. I wait for his conclusions, and have made up my mind to act accordingly. Whatever step I take, shall be for your interest as well as Henrys. The loss Mr Woods is already convinced, will be great. Including interest due on unaccommodated stock, not less he fears than $30 p.cent: percent what a wretched business!! Present me, with great respect to Mrs Polk , and believe me your friend Ephraim H Hubbard Foster
