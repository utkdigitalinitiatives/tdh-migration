Near Cheeks X Cross Roads Grainger County 3rd June 1845 Harmon G. Lea Esq Esquire Dear Sir Feeling very well assured that you are a true and unswerving Whig , and that you desire the success of Whig principles and all the great & glorious measures of the same. I write you to night tonight , in the true Whig spirit, partaking of & congenial to that which animated & warmed the bosoms of our patriotic ancestors in the ever memorable days of 1776 — To say that I am a firm, an unbending & inflexible Whig, is but to report what I have always honestly felt & stile still feel & ever expect to remain while life & reason remain. My principles are fixed & are true as the polar star & as unvarying. Vacillation — political equivocation & subterfuge upon plain, broad & leading questions of public policy I most heartily detest & utterly despise. I love to see a man declare his sentiments, political, or otherwise with frankness— candor — honesty — plainness.— But enough of this. I think my course since I have become a candidate before the people for the station of Representative of my native Grainger is a sufficient proof of the sincerity of my heart in the declaration of my principles. & my entire devotedness to the same. — I became a candidate at the request and by the solicitation of those who had known

me long and well — friends tried & true. I who thought me worthy of their confidence & support I felt grateful to them for their generous encouragement. I felt, as I still feel, willing to serve them as they Representative , to the best of my humble abilities. I went out among the people — I visited the different portions of the county & it is, as is ever will be, a source of pride — of pleasure & of gratification that I recd received encouragement wherever I went. — I feel grateful — deeply grateful to all of my friends for these peculiar favors. — Cal Cleveland became a candidate sometime after I had & also Esq Esquire Moore . They were both older men, by far, than myself, but as my fellow citizens considered me worthy of their support. I felt willing to serve them My claims are equal to those of either of the other candidates. Cal C Cal Cleveland has served the people long, it is true, but he has been amply remunerated for the same to say nothing about a certain $48.00 he recd received for services never rendered. I refer to the Journals. — Now, I manifested an entire willingness to submit my claims to the action of the freemen of the county from the first movement of my appearance before them. I wished Union & Harmony & a concentration of the Whig forces in the important contest now going on. — I consider it a matter of the utmost importance to have a Whig Legislation. at the ensuing session The reasons were obvious — You own good sense advises you what they are. Every genuine Whig comprehends them at a glance. — Please state the matter in the right light before Dr. S Shields & your uncle Jeremiah Jarnagin & all others you may see, & if you think I deserve any thing at your hands I shall be grateful for any assistance you may render me. I only ask stern & inflexible justice. H. Shannon

My friends say to me — Stick to the track. They will support me. I feel that they will. Some of them have even gone so far as to say that they will vote for McGinnis , if Cleveland was his only opponent. I fully believe it. — I onsto to do for the best. — I do honestly prefer the success of my principles to any more personal promotion of my own. And if it was really essential to the success of our glorious principles, I would take a peculiar pride & a pleasure in sacrificing any claims that I may have to the Nation upon the altar of my Country's good, if by so doing I could ensure their success. Each candidate has his friends but it is quite clear that the issue is now, as it has been all along between Cleveland & myself. You have some idea how the canvass has progressed. I could fill this sheet in a detail of the matter but must be brief. On yesterday (Monday) we met at Rutledge & made some speeches — Col. McGinnis merely declared himself a candidate — Cleveland followed in a rather singular speech — an attempt to vindicate himself & his declarations. Since the commencement of this canvass — & seemed to try to make the impression that he was the champion of our cause &c et cetera — Esq. Esquire Moore presented himself next & blazed away awhile & seemed quite Docile & tractable indeed. I followed & avowed the same. Principles, that I have ever entertained & expressed my willingness & desire to abide by a fair expression of the will of the people, if that could be ascertained. I expressed my willingness to submit the whole matter to the people to be determined by their vote en masse on 21st instant — at the time of the proposed adjustment of the Congressional matter. Cleveland would not agree to it, unless I would consent to go & remain perfectly still & quiet until after the election. The blood of a freeman flows in my veins. I felt as freeman. I acted as a freeman. I would not consent to such arrangement. It was ingenerous ungenerous to say the least of it. He knew that my acquaintance was limited throughout the county — at least in some portions of it & thought to take advantage of it. It is characteristic of the man. — The next proposition that was made was to this effect — that we leave the decision of the matter to the Grand Jury — the Court sitting & appointing at the time. Cleveland & Moore agreed to it immediately . I did not feel willing to enter into any such arrangement, without taking time for reflection — I told them so — considerable excitement got up — a good deal of warmth manifested. the advocates of the new proposition urging me to decide instantly whether or no.— I told them I would let them know my determination on Saturday next at Beans Station — Moore was willing to consider the matter binding on him, but Cleveland would not, & remind us I thought disposed to agree to nothing. Except it suited him, & to his advantage. I have determined not to leave the decision of the matter to the ⁁ proposed mind Jury or any other than the Grand Jury of the whole people, assembled at the Ballot Box. I feel fully

sustained in the course I have pursued. I wish it to be distinctly ⁁ understood inverse that I am entirely willing & desirous that the difficulty could be amicably & satisfactorily adjusted at any time, before the general election. I feel a deep interest in the matter I ardently desire the success of our principles — & would gladly do any thing, that could be done consistently & honorably for the success of the fame. But I have learned a few thing in relation to this matter, that fully convinces me, that there are more workers engaged in their under handed business of intrigue & management. I have several of the prominent leading characters, as I believe in my eye at this time, who are engaged in this business. — They are would-be Leaders — Cleveland is their man. They think to draw me in the snare, but I am in the alert & am looking out for brokers ahead — I do not doubt, but that the proposition as to the Grand Jury &c et cetera , will be most grossly misrepresented by those whose interest it is to do so. My not agreeing to enter into the arrangement will be construed entirely different from what is the real fact of the matter. It will doubtless be placed to the score of contrariness & obstinacy & an unwillingness ⁁ in me to have the difficulty settled. Such is not the case. It is not true. — I have my reasons for not doing so — conclusive & entirely satisfactorily to myself & friends. — It was as uncertain as the wind to say the least of it. It could not possibly be a fair expression. We are to meet at Bean's Station on next Saturday & see more about the whole matter. A pretty good attendance is expected & desired. If it would not be too inconvenient, I would be extremely happy to see you up at the Station on Saturday next at the proposed meeting. Please excuse haste & very bad writing as I have written in great haste. I am very sincerely your friend Hardin P. Shannon I arrived home from Rutledge late this evening & feeling anxious that you be acquainted with the facts in the case. I have taken the liberty to write you. If you cannot come to the Station, be so kind as to drop me a few lines, as a friend, on the whole matter. As soon after recpt receipt as you conveniently can at Russelville — & oblige Yrs &c Yours et cetera Hardin P.
