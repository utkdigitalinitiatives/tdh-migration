Hermitage July 28th 1840 My dear Sir, I have recd. received your letter of the 12th instant, and rejoice with the whole democracy of the union on the final passage of the Independent Treasury bill — It is a death blow to the Tides ⁁ hard ciderites siderites — The republican members of Congress deserve well of their country — they fought the battle well, & ⁁ like heroes conquered. Our political horrison horizon brightens and I have no fears but republicanism will succeed in November next & Van Buren will be elected ⁁ by a large majority — and The exposure of the frauds committee in the New Jersey case and that of Ingersol & Naylor in Pensylvania Pennsylvania , will prevent the reiteration of them, next fall — these frauds & corruptions has opened the eyes of the people & all will be awake ⁁ & vigilent vigilant to prevent a repition repetition of them at the polls— all honest men must unite in preserving the purity of elections— all must be vigilent vigilant ⁁ hereafter to prevent frauds at the polls. I have duly

your referrence reference to the attack upon you & Genl General Jessup thro through the instrument of Genl General W. Scott in the House— I have waited before answering your letter to see it, but the Globe containing it has not reached me, I therefore take up my pen to reply to your letter that part that relates to Genl General Scott , I send that ⁁ part so that it can be seperated separated from this and used as an extract of this letter — you will see to bring the case fairly out I have ⁁ had to take a review of Genl General Scott Florida campaign which owing to his delay at the depo depot of provision ⁁ for weeks scouting for waggons wagons to Baltimore &c&c et cetera et cetera , contrary to my admonition to him the evening that he left Washing Washington to take command in the South — instead of finding out where the Indian women were, & having two company of spies woodsmen & lead led by gallant officers ⁁ & taking his eight day rations on their backs he planned a campaign, on a magnificent scale, in three colums columns to march from three differrent different points to meet in the centre center of the wilderness — ? for what? to surround an owl, for he knew not where the body of the Indian women were — They all got lost & never found each other until they met at Tampa bay where the campaign ended in entire failure.

You inform me in your ⁁ letter of the 12th ⁁ instant that Genl General Scott through his ⁁ supple tool , friend Mr Biddle in Congress; is treating Genl General Jessup most basely — you say you are told that on yesterday he attacked Jessup most bitterly — that one of the charges heaped upon ⁁ him was, that I had recalled Genl General Scott in consequence of your interferrence interference , and ask me for the facts of the case ⁁ I answer you are charged falsly falsely — and if this case is fully brought out Genl General Scott will have reason to exclaim — Save me from my friends. In giving you a proper state of of of the facts alluded to, I must go back to Genl General Scotts campaign in Florida to bring to your view how it happened that Genl General Jessup was ordered to proceed to the South and take the command of the Georgia & Alabama Troops called for, to put down the Sudden rising and war with the Creeks — and I ⁁ must refer to the files of the War department, if I err in my recollection

Page 4

these will correct me as I write from memory. From the mismanagement & desasters disasters that had ocurred occurred in Florida the Executive was determined to put this punie puny war ⁁ down in Florida — Genl General Scott with all the disposable regular force, and the ⁁ requisitions Georgia & South Carolina militia were ordered on this service — Genl General Scott cloathed clothed with full powers to call for all necessary supplies for his army for prompt & efficient movement — The regular force with supplies had been ordered to Florida to form a depo depot at the most advanced & eligable eligible point on which to concentrate the militia ordered into service. The evening of the night that Genl General Scott left Washington , I had an interview with the Genl General ⁁ in the presence of Major Donelson at which I suggested to him the propriety of ordering the officer ⁁ in command in advance to procure at all hazzard hazard & expence expense a knowledge of where the Indian women were — to have two good spy companies organised organized led by gallant men, good woodsmen & ⁁ well acquainted with Indian cunning & treachery — ⁁ for the Genl General to pass thro through South Carolina & Georgia, hasten on the militia to the Depo Depot of provisions have them mustered into service and having procured the information where the Indian women were, to take eight days rations on their backs; and by

Page 5

sheet 2nd by a forced march reach the deposit of the women & children, where he would be sure to find all the warriors, and where by one blow he could put an end to the war. I admonished him against the attempt of entering the wields, & swamps of Florida with waggons wagons that if he did he never could find an Indian — But by taking eight days rations on each soldiers back, which with economy, & killing a beef when the came across cattle, the men would not suffer much in thirteen days march, ordering the supplies to follow him — referring the Genl General to the attempt of Genl General Gains & Genl General Glasscock to take baggage waggons wagons with the Georgia militia on the Seminole Campaign — had Genl General Scott adopted these suggestions he would have put an end to the war in less than three months, for at that very period powel had all his women and children in the Withlecouckey hammocks. Have for the Genl General profitted profited by these admonitions of mine his communications on file in the war office will show — When he reached the depo depot of provisions with

Page 6

the militia, he waited there several weeks awaiting the arrival of waggons wagons & there planned his campaign of three grand colums columns to meet in the center, to surround what — the Indians, no, for as far as any official document has come to my view Genl General Scott had no positive information where the Indian women & children were — he knew where powel & his warriors were as they had checked the march of that Genl General ⁁ Gains at Withlecoocky Withlecouckey , & made him fortify & defend himself for some days until relieved by Genl General Clinch & 600 men — Genl General Scott at length took the field with his three columns, — they got lost, never met until they united at Tampa bay without finding an Indian except those who lay in ambush, — fired on Genl General Scotts collumn column , killing & wounding some ten or twelve men — The summer ad having advanced the sickly season coming easy ⁁ on the Genl General abandoned the campaign & he returned to St. Augustine sick, & from there made his report to the Secretary of War — (See it) The Secretary of War was instructed by me, the campaign being over to permit the Genl General ⁁ being sick to return to New York , to

Page 7

to regain his health. About this time the creek War broke out — a dispute arose between the Georgia Genl General and the Genl General commanding the Alabama militia who had a right to the command of the united forces of the two states — To put down this contention between the two Genls Generals and Genl General Scott having reported himself sick and having leave to return to New York to repair his health, Genl General Jessup was ordered to proceed to the South and assume the command of the Georgia & Alabama troops & crush the War in is bud. Genl General Jessup promptly obeyed this order proceeded to the South to take the command, and on his way to Columbus Georgia , Genl General Scott who had not left St. Augustine hearing of the hostility of the Creeks, passed to Georgia, met Genl General Jessup, assumed the command & order Genl General Jessup to pass thro through the Indian country to where the Alabama troops were encamped & assume the command of them — Jessup found the Alabamians ready for active operations & of sufficient force

Page 8

to quell the enemy — and Genl General Patterson having obtained positive information where the hostile chief with his warriors were concealed in a swamp — well knowing the Indian character that if he was not surprised in his hiding place & captured or destroyed — he would evade pursuit by separating into small parties and annoy the whole Georgia & Alabama borders insisted upon Genl General Jessup forthwith to lead them to the attack of the hostile chief who was in striking distance of their encampment, and from whence daily, parties sallied forth upon the frontier & was murdering, their wives & children, burning and destroying. The Genl General could not allay the order of the brave Genl General Paterson Patterson & his brave followers, under such circumstances as these — Jessup ordered the line of march for the hostile chiefs hiding place, got within six miles of his camp met an order from Jessup Scott to halt & await his further orders ⁁ Genl General Scott not being ready to take field of course Genl General Jessup obeyed, but Genl General Paterson Patterson declared that he should not — ⁁ that by obeying the order of Genl General Scott the hostile chief with his warriors would make their

Page 9

escape, prolong the war as in Florida — that he then by a prompt & silent movement he could reach capture & destroy him — therefore he would take upon himself the responsibility — did so , and that night — surprised the chief captured him & the whole concentrated enemy ⁁ warriors and put an end to the war. Refer to the documents on file — you will there find that Genl General Scott had been with the militia on the frontier for about six weeks without arms in their hands instead of marching the men to the arsnel arsenal & arming them there ⁁ They were marching to the frontier exausting exhausting their supplies & keeping those who had arms to guard & protect the unarmed Soldier, and because he Genl General Scott was not in a situation to operate & finding Jessup with the Alabamians in motion to attack the hostile chief & his warriors orders him to halt until he Genl General Scott is ready to cooperate & before that ⁁ time the hostile chief would have removed himself & that campain campaign would have failed like the Genls Generals in

Page 10

Florida — Before you shew show me the letter of Genl General Jessup to you, it appeared that Genl General Scott had communicated & so had, perhaps Genl General Jessup, these facts to the Secretary of War but the Secretary had not shewn shown the letters to me — On your producing to me the letter of Genl General Jessup, I forthwith sent it to the secretary of war, and requested him to report to me all communications he had received on that subject — The Secretary of war came to my office ⁁ whilst you were there & brought the letters and observed that the reason why he had not reported the letters to me, that he knew from Genl General Scotts ⁁ failure in Florida and late ineficiency inefficiency I would have ⁁ forthwith recalled him — your had no agency in this matter except shewing showing me Genl General Jessups letter & inquiring into the facts — I had heard with surprise that after Genl General Scotts entire failure in Florida reporting himself sick at St. Augustine, having leave to repair to N. York New York for the benefit of his health, and without giving information ⁁ to the Department, hearing that Jessup was ordered ⁁ to that command for the reason given, to repair to the South & ⁁ to assume the command of the Troops ordered against the creeks, that Genl General Scott should proceed from St. Augustine

Page 11

to Georgia intercept Jessup & assume the command, & instead of marching the men to the arsenel arsenal & arming them that he had them concentrated at Columbia Georgia without arms within 25 & 30 miles of where the Indians were daily murdering and plundering our Citizens displayed such inefficency inefficiency that I should have recalled him from the command but when I heard that Genl General Jessup was when in six miles of the enemy ⁁ was ordered by Genl General Scott to halt, & not to advance until further orders & until he was ⁁ ready to move having been several weeks at Columbus , I determined forthwith to recall him as too inefficent inefficient to wield an army against Indians— therefore the charge that you or Genl General Jessup had any thing do with the recall of Genl General Scott is unjust & groundless — it was the facts reported to me, that assured me that Genl General Scott had not promptness & energy enough to succeed in an Indian war. Andrew Jackson Junr Junior is quite sick & has been for some time my little family wish me in kind regard to you & yours —

I remain your friend Andrew Jackson Fr. P. Blair Esqr. Esquire P. S. Post Script your letter was put on file in the war office, & was very improperly brought into view by the ⁁ Genl General Scotts court ⁁ of inquiry for which I gave them a very modest reprimand — as that court had nothing to do with you Genl General Jessup — he nor his military proceedings was not before them in any way. Had Jessup & Scott been before that court, how could it excuse Genl General Scott for his delay of six weeks on the frontier with men without arms, — and could any military court excused him or justified his order to Jessup to halt when he was in sufficient force to destroy the enemy & within six miles — The order ought to have broke Scott, or at least deeply censured him, when it appears by his letter to Jessup that he will ⁁ would not be ready to ⁁ move under three days — in that time there would have been ⁁ this Crek Creek chief & warriors — perhaps in Florida — at any rate where Genl General Scott could not have found him with his train of baggage waggons wagons — A.
