Nashville Sep. September 5th 1832 Mr. Gillespie Dear Sir Everything was going on so well at home, that I concluded day before yesterday, to come down here , and breathe the same atmosphere with the great men of our nation. Last evening, I was in the company of the President, Genl's General's Eaton , Carrol, & Coffee ⁁ Judge White Houston &c &c. and et cetera and et cetera Eaton is spoken of very strongly for Senator, though I can scarcely believe that he will be a candidate. Great interest and excitement is manifested by almost every person in the election. Mr. Foster , is engaged every moment of his time in electioneering, and requested me to write to you. He says that McFarland he thinks will vote for him, but he fears that Mr. Fain & Colo. Colonel Brazelton will make him (Mc F.) render a rigid account to his constituents for his vote. Mr Foster says that you can do something with Mr. Fain & Colo. Colonel Brazelton, to relieve Mr. McFarland from this embarrassment; I have written a short letter, to Mr. Fain, but you will see him, and can talk to him upon the subject. I find that the papers you sent to Mr. F. have been filed in the Secretary's office, but McGraw has neglected to send the papers, which he promised to do. The secretary says that I can file them at my leisure. I will write to Maj. Major McGraw immediately, & request him to forward the necessary papers without delay.

I have not said much yet about the claim of Carters heirs, but D. Dickinson has promised me to attend to it. I talk'd talked with Colo. Colonel Wiley about it, he gave me to understand that Mr. Gillespie of Blount Cy County would introduce a resolution that will suit the claim But I do not think that Colo. Colonel Wiley will give the measure his support; he is in my opinion a recreant and an apostate from his old friends & their interest. He is I am told boarding at Grundy's son in law's house ( I McGavock ); and electioneers hard for Grundy. I still think Mr. Fosters Prospect good, even against J. H. Eaton I shall return home tomorrow & I will write to Elizabeth, as soon as I return. Give my love to her & to the family.

Yours AffectionatelyWm RichdWilliam Richard CaswellThe legislature is waiting upon the committee of the congressional districts—It is pretty generally understood that J.H. Eaton will be run for the Senate. Mr. Foster says he will fight him to the ditch. I have just placed your papers in the hands of  D. Dickinson, who promises to attend to them. Yrs. &cYours and et ceteraCaswell
