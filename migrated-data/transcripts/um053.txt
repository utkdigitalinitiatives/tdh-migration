Watertown , May 22nd/48 Dear Father Uncle Hubert recieved received yours of the 9th two or three days ago I was glad to hear from you as it has been some time scince since you wrote to me but I suppose you expected me home all the while. But God in his all wise providence has ordered it otherwise and we must cheerfully submit to his will. I came from Bridgeport here last Friday ( May 14 ) to enjoy spend a week or ten days but I do not know how long I shall stay but shall be governed entirely by ⁁ my health I saw Dr. Doctor Elton (Mothers favorite) Yesterday he staid stayed some time and talked with me and said he did not think it would be safe for me to attempt to travel in my present state of health and thought I had better stay around here this summer and get strong and well before I attempted to travel or study I am very weak at present and what is worse than

that I have the rheumatism in my legs and ankles so much so that it is with great difficulty I can walk around the house, this you know prevents my taking what exercise I should like to and makes it very disagreable disagreeable for myself, still Doctor Elton thinks this will only be temporary and I hope it will prove so. As to the disease in my head there is no change in it as I can percieve perceive , and I thing think that if this attack has had no effect on it, that nothing can. Relative to my studies I can only say that I shall not be able to attend to them this summer and as to takin resuming them in the fall it depends entirely opon upon yourself you know my willingness to do what you think best. but nevertheless I think that we have had pretty clear indications of Providence that it is not the course for me to take I leave the subject entirely to your better judgement = = = = = = I do not, nor do any of my friends think it is best for me to come home this summer and although nothing would please me better still I have determined to stay here and at Bridgeport untill until I hear from you Uncle Huberts family are all well but still I miss Grandpa and little Henry They all write

tell aunt Eliza I do not understand about that baptismal scene but really I did not think that a woman that had arrived at her Old age would have been guilty of arranging herself in childish fooleries so much so that her own child did not know her tell ⁁ her that Richard and his sweet-tempered wife do not agree very well, they have parted two or three times this winter and at last came to blows, but I beleave believe they are reconciled now I saw Mary and Jasman , they send their love to you (Eliza) and wish you would write to them. The crops are all coming on here finely and every thing promises for a bountiful harvest every body everybody is going crazy about rail-roads They are building a rail road from Waterbury to join with the New York and N New Haven rail road & which is being graded and they think will be in operation by the first of January I have money enough I think to last me through the summer and pay my expenses but if you should have occasion to send any one do not send South Carolina money Give my love to all and Mary and write to Ben and tell him to write to me and give me his direction tell Pres to write often Write me soon and tell me what your plans are Yours &c et cetera E Edward E Porter
