Knoxville Tennessee Dec. December 28th 1839 Brother Charles. There is very little news here, that is worth writing to any one._ But as Franklin has just arrived, so that Ham can leave for home in the morning I will write a few lines at all events. Christmas holy-days are about over here; and I believe nothing has been done here, by way of celebration. The times here, in fact, are unusually dull and lifeless._ I expected very sanguinely to see brother Lewis this evening in company with Franklin_ had I known that he intended to defer coming up untill until the 8th or 10th of January; as badly prepared as I am for loasing losing time I should have gone home some time since. Inform him that severals up here have been expecting him some time and when he comes to be prepared to stay a day or so._ Say to mother, for me, that her Christmas gift came to hand; and cannot but be prized very highly by me,_ as comeing coming from home & and more especially from any mother_ I think the cake will not fail to fatten me. I have heard of no one wanting to hire Ham yet. As to the price of clover seed you have or will hear more from Frederick than I can inform you_ provided always that there is no great secret about it; and farther if it should not give a clue to his plans and

future operations._ The pork offered to this market this winter has been nearly or quite double in quantity to that of any previous year. Have you any shelters of for the Durham stock; if not they will fare badly to night? Are they in a thrifty condition? There is now and has been during a week or two past a lot of the Durham stock in town. They were brought here by Mr. Daugherty from Kentucky . _ If I do not speak publickly publicly , I would say there is very little of the genuine stock in his lot of some 20 or 25._ For some he asks 3 and 4 hundred dollars; but they are greatly inferior to any one of yours. Some he has sold for 2 and 3 hundred dollars already I do not believe, in fact, I know, I would not give your four for the whole lot._ On yesterday I saw Mr. Heiskel 's Bull for which he gave one thousand dollars._ His is a very fine animal._ But in my opinion he is not superior in any respect to Hanibal_ he is larger it is true; but Hanibal if treated as he should be will be as large or large and I think he excells excels Heiskel's in one or two very important parts. You should have him curried regularly and if you would have the hair on his head and neck kept strait straight and smooth it would make a wonderful difference in his countenance. Lewis will infer from this that I have caught the Durham fever. Give my respects to all. James M. Monroe Welcker
