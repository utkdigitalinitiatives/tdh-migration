Rutledge July 21st 1828 Gov Governor . Houston I understood yesterday in Knoxville that Genl General . Howard had stated that, on his return from Nashville a few days since that owing to the pressure on those indebted to the Nashville, and New State Bank, and some other causes, there was great probability that you would be constrained to convene the legislature,__ that you had so expressed yourself, which if it be true, autherise the belief that there will be as extra session__ at least with me, as I know your feelings to be against it__ I would like to know certainly__ or if you have not determined on it to know from you whether there is a probability of it__ Perhaps I should not make the inquiry__ I will hint to you my reason, you can then answer me on this subject or not as you think most prudent. If you write your letter shall be confidential or not as you may direct.__ Turney has left our district, and I have understood will resign should there be a called session, this I do not know certainly however I think it very likely probable
