Columbia Tennessee December 29th 42 My dear Papa, I am happy to hear from your kind letter that all the dear children were so much better. I suffered great uneasiness and anxiety about them until until until I received your last, indeed you cannot imagine how sincerely I have wished to be at home so that I could assist you and Aunt Narcissa in nursing them. I hope that King & Will will not have a severe spell. Mr Smith was so kind as to give us this christmas, a weeks holyday holiday . I have employed my time in writing my Examination Composition. I attented attended a party at Aunt Walkers on Monday evening, enjoyed myself very much. It does not seem to be a Merry Christmas with any one. Alice Bennis has been at Aunt Walkers all week. she seem to be very well contented now. Dear Papa You dont know how much distressed I am to hear that you entertain any doubt concerning the subject which you mentioned in your letter. I had thought that I said eneough enough to convince you that it was not so , I am

greived grieved to hear that my name should be mentioned in connextion connection with his. I tell you candidly that there is no foundation for such reports. he has never even mentioned the subject to me, and I cant imagine what it was taken from, but why waste words about it; as I hope that you are convinced now. I know that it was perfectly natural that you should ask me about it and also perfectly right; Beleive Believe me, you need never fear that I will make any engagements without your knowledge and consent or at least that is what I think now. I hope now that you will rest satisfied upon that head. I shall expect you up to the Examination in January, and will study very hard, to do justice both to myself and you. I should be delighted if you could bring Sister up with you, if you cannot come please let Brother John , for I shall be much better satisfied if some one of you are here. Tell Aunt Narcissa that I am anxious to receive an answer to my last letter. I should be pleased to receive a letter from Sister and my two Brothers. but I know it is useless to ask them. Give my Best love to Aunt N. Narcissa and all my relations. Kiss my dear little Brothers and sister, and all the children for me. Please Papa dont let any one see this letter. Burn it as soon as you get it. Ever affectionately M. J. Mary Jane Chester
