In Camp Isabella , 6 miles from Washington. Rhea County 14th June 1846 My Dear Wife I wrote to you a few lines from Campbell Station .— The next day we came to Kingston , and a few miles before we reached there, we were exposed to a rain, which drenched us thoroughly, and drooped our feathers— we had a rough time of it and comfortable night; on yesturday yesterday we came about 18 miles, and were greeted with another shower nothing remarkable occurred; at Kingston, my men being very wet, could not be kept from taking too much of what they called the "Rye—O"— James Brazelton , took his full share, I expect he is to be very much trouble, but I will try every kind means to keep him from dissipation, and if I cannot succeed thus I will exercise my authority— which as Captain is more absolute than I could desire— There are others in my company, worse than James. And I have ⁁ already been under the necessity of sending a Sergeant with a file of men, to bring several soldiers into camps, and put them under guard— I have had no other difficulty, except on account of intoxication, that is to keep my men from drinking too much spirits— I have lost a pair of of my Mackinaw Blankets, but I still hope to find them in the camp of the Claiborne Blues or of Waterhouse . We have left the Claiborne Blues 6 miles behind to-night tonight — we were in a very hard rain this morning & they stoped stopped at a camp ground, we swam across a creek and came on to this a beautiful encampment which you will see we have named Isabella for miss

Isabella White , who is my 1st Lieutenants sweet heart. I need not write you the particulars of our proceedings at Knoxville , for Ann will give you the particulars if she has not already done so— We have attracted the attention of every person in reach of the road;— I cannot tell you what route we shall go to Memphis To-morrow tomorrow I shall start my baggage waggon wagon , across the Sequache Valley , where I shall encamp to-morrow tomorrow night, but I will march my company some 3 or 4 miles out of the way by Washington to meet with Waterhouse' company— The company can march 25 or 30 miles a day but the waggon wagon cannot travel more than 18 or 20 miles— Thus far we have had very unfavorable weather upon the outset of the campaign, but I have done very well, and begin to get used to it, for notwithstanding the rains, I sleep sound at night and have escaped colds so far— My company were paid $25.— each to buy clothing— I was responsible for their uniforms, and some other purchases, & I got the money from the bank ($2,570.)— I have not paid off all the men yet, but there will not be enough left for me to get my full share which is $120—. I am very anxious to hear from you— Not a word have I heard from you since I left— Be sure to make Eliza write; I cannot tell where to write to, now, unless, at to McMinnville , but you will probably see from the "standard" what route we will travel to Memphis — and by making a calculation, you can guess where to write— George Gillespie is going with us to Memphis & he is going to Nashville , & there get instructions what route we shall travel— Your Affectionate husband Wm.R. William Richard Caswell —

I have read over the foregoing letter, and feel that I ought to apologise apologize for so poor a letter— The men calling every few minutes to know what they must do about their horses— their provisions &c, &c et cetera, et cetera and thus I have my hands full— yrs yours affectionately
