Sugar hill January 30th 1815 Dear Son yours of the 11th inst instant . came safe to hand, in which I learn that two of my sons Glen & Thos Thomas are prisoners with the British, they will suffer no doubt in the hands of such a savage force but there is still a hope of their being exchanged for and return again to their friends, am glad it is no worse their wives had been informed they were both killed But your letter coming has revived all our hopes of their returning to us again. Our commanding general will no doubt try to bring a bout about an exchange of prisoners, as soon as time will permit him to attend to it my wife has been sick ever since you left us, and very quite useless ever since the 10 December last. & I myself have been afflicted with rumatoid rheumatoid pains. must have suffered considerably if your Brother John Hardeman had not sent Billey to cut fire wood those surcomstances circumstances have prevented me from seeing your wife nor should I have seen Thos Thomas J. Hardemans wife if she had not come herself. She has a fine boy. The Tennesseans Both officers & men I am told have distinguished their patriotick patriotic bravery that have been faught fought . They a pattron pattern for our sister states to follow, and teach our common enemy how to tower their high sounding sine qua non. It appears however that our British enemy is determined to fight us into conquerers conquerors , or nonexistance nonexistence , and feel verry very much to meet them on that ground.
