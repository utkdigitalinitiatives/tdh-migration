Trenton Sep. September 29th 1844 Dear Sir Your favor of 20th Inst Instant came to hand a day or two ago. I am rejoiced to hear that the democracy are moving so earnestly, in the Middle Dist. District & doubtless their efforts will not be unavailing; I can see no way of escape for the Whigs since Wright 's nomination in New York , the acknowledgment of the doubtful result in Ohio by the Whigs themselves, the strong hope entertained by our friends of carrying New Jersey , __ Tennessee I strongly believe will go for us. my prayer is for this above all things__ As for we W.

I have just returned from Dyer county , our friends are not doing any thing there at all, I was surprised at this greatly & drew from the few democrats I saw a promise to organize immediately & spread the documents which they have hitherto not done,__ there are a few changes, 25 or 30, but these are not enough they can do more & will_ Obion is all right alright an immense gain there, Weakley is up & on fire, she will do nobly this time Carroll will give us changes: but not many__ Madison will do very well Henderson very well & all our counties are now bidding fair for a large increase Dave Johnson Recd Received a letter from A Johnson , of E Tenn East Tennessee , who says that if W West & M Middle Tenn will only hold on as they were, that E.T. East Tennessee will do sufficient to carry the State._ We entertain no doubt here of the final result & are betting on it, the Whigs are scared & no enthusiasm among them. Our campaign is organised organized , & we have all officers elected, & are only waiting to draw arms. this we will do immediately We are doing all in our power to keep up the enthusiasm God prosper the Cause, & success set up our standards, & never such a triumph ever in Jackson times will crown our efforts. I am very truly your friend, Th Claiborne Jr Junior
