Knoxville July 18th 1836 Gov Governor . Cannon Dear Sir, The enclosed paper prepared in obediance obedience to a resolution adopted by the Convention which met in this place on the 4th Inst Instant . was handed to me by a member of the committee who prepared the same with a request to deliver it to you on your arrival in this place from Athens But understanding that you probably had abandoned the idea of visiting us presently to your return to Nashville and the convention having ajourned adjourned I have concluded it was proper for me to forward it to you The great object for which the convention assembled I hope is in a state that haves little doubt of its final execution. Indeed the zeal and talent arraged arranged here on the 4th in favor of the enterprize were of a character sufficient to accomplish any thing almost which was not wholly impracticable I request that your official engagements would not permit you to participate in the deliberations of the Convention__ I have no doubt you would have been highly delighted with the harmony and liberal spirit and feeling which was manifested throughout the meeting I am with sentiments of the highest respect your obt. svt obedient servant . Jno John . McMillan
