			 Tennessee, was born in 
			 Pennsylvania, 
			 1760, and came to Tennessee in 
			 1788. He was educated for the law and
			 was a fine scholar.He was admitted to the Tennessee bar at 
			 Jonesboro and 
			 Greeneville, 
			 1778, and the same year he was
			 appointed Attorney-General for the district of 
			 Hamilton. Was a member of the
			 Constitutional Convention 
			 1796. When the State was organized
			 Roane was elected one of the Superior Judges for the State. 
			 1801John Sevier retired from the Gonvernorship
			 and Roane was elected without opposition. He gave offense to Sevier by casting
			 his vote as Governor against him and for 
			 Andrew Jackson for Major-General, and at
			 the next gubernatorial election Sevier defeated him overwhelmingly in spite of
			 General Jackson's influence. The vote stood, Roane 4,923; Sevier, 6,480. Roane
			 then retired from political life until 
			 1815, when he was appointed one of
			 the Supreme Judges of the State. This office he held until his death, which
			 occurred in 
			 1818.He is said to have been a highly cultured gentleman, and to have had
			 an aversion to the turmoils of the political life of his day. While he was
			 Governor of Tennessee the State was laid off into three Congressional districts
			 to-wit: 
			 Washington, Hamilton, and 
			 Mero. 
			 Knoxville was the capital of the State.
