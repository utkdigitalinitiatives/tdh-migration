Bayou Goula La Louisiana Dcr December 6th 1939 Dear Fitz. Fitzgerald After I wrote you in the summer and received your answer I requested capt captain saml Samuel to make some exchange with you, if it could be done, to get the girl Polly back, as she belongs to a family of negroes I yet have, but I have heard nothing about the result and know nothing about what has been done about it, or whether any thing. I saw Dewitt a few days since in Vicksburg , he told me that he had sent his family to Paris , and that he had sent along with them a pair of horses belonging to me. As I can not raise the money to pay the balance of the notes you endorsed for me, I have concluded to apprise you that the horses are mine, and that you may sell them to pay the debt, as far as they will go. They are a pair of handsome grey horses- (Saml knows them) and as good a pair of carriage horses as are in the state. All I ask is that you will make the most you can out of them, which I know you will do. I have refused $500 for then repeatedly- but do not expect they will command it in your market. Take whatever measures may be necessary to get them into possession, should there be any difficulty about it. Dewitt has no earthly claim to them-- I only loaned them to him, to carry his family to Texas , but as he is not going there with them, I want you to get the benefit of them, as I cannot raise the money to relieve you.

As soon as the negro and the horses are sold write me what they bring, and as soon as possible, I will raise the balance in some way and remit it to you. I hope before they press you for it. I have yet some means left in Miss Mississippi , with which I will pay all of my own debts as soon as I can make them available__ I have enough left yet to pay my own debts, and will do so before a great while, but I can not at present command my means. I have been worse harrassed harassed and have suffered more on account of my liabilities for other people, than almost any other man ever did. I think however, that I am getting my business in a train to adjust it, before a great while. I am on my way to Texas, from which I expect to return in February, when you shall hear from me again. If one thing you may rest satisfied, you shall not lose a single dollar, by your friendship for me. Write me when you receive this, directed to Natchitoches . La as letters can not cross the line, I will send there for it. your old friend G.W. Terrell
