Frankfort — August 7th 1845 Dear Foster, On this day your eventful election in Tennessee takes place. I am anxious, and yet fearful, to hear the result — You have mighty odds to contend against — and tho though I have the greatest confidence in your prowess, I fear for you in this unequal contest. If you succeed, you will, indeed, deserve a crown of Victory, and if you fail, your fate will be but that of the brave soldier who keeps the field to the last, & falls sword in hand — You may see from all this, that I am a good deal troubled in my mind about you — I don't do not know, why I should be, for I am sure you will at least deserve success, and, whether you obtain it or not, that you will still be happy, & stil still enjoy that joyous laugh

of yours, which can only come from a sound, manly & triumphant heart — I would rather you should lose the office of Governor, than be deprived of that glorious laugh — I don't do not know, upon the whole, if it would not be better for you to be beaten, as Mrs Foster will then, perhaps, be able to keep you at home, and make some thing out of you, to recompense her for all the case & trouble such a political run = about husband must have given her. Do you, present my very kindest regards to Mrs Foster, and also my congratulations on the result of the election, whatever it may be — for if she does not share in your success, she will succeed in getting back her husband. I sat down to do little more than to request you to give me the earliest information of the probable result of your election — I shall hardly draw an easy breath till I know what it is. I met with your Governor

Jones at Lexington — He was well received & well treated, & returned home, I hope, will pleased — He made a good impression on our people. Farewell, Foster, — and if you really want to be Governor, I hope you may be elected — and whether elected or not, that you may always be just as happy as you desire. Yr Your Friend J J Crittenden Hon: Honorable E. H. Foster P. S. Post Script Our elections terminated yesterday — as yet our information is too partial to determine much about the results — There is no doubt, I think, but that our Whig Representatives in Congress will be increased.
