Columbia Sept September 29' 28 Dear Sir, Upon reexamination, I find that Bradshaw has a deed, registered in this county, to the five hundred acres of land on Obion a part of McLean's 2500 acre tracts. It was deeded to B. Bradshaw by John McGimsey of N North . Carolina in the year 1818 and registered the same year â€” The health of this county is excellent, & the crops are fine. I have heard several farmers say that some of their hands picked out 100 lbs of cotton daily. I hope your health ere now is perfectly restored Respectfully T.H. Cahal
