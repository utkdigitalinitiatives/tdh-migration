Jasper Marion County E. East Tennessee To his excellency Newton Cannon Governor of the State of Tennessee __ Sir It appears that you thought it most advisable to have a call session for the year 1836. I presume it is generally known throughout Tennessee that myself and son removed the first rocks for steam Boat navigation at the Suck and Boiling Pot in the Tennessee River in the years 1831 and 2 on our own private funs funds and it has so turned out that we have never received the first cent It is true that the commissioners offered us $1421-75 for the work done by us at those rapids in the year 1831- We refused to accept that sum because it fell short of paying us and the work done by us in 1832 left out_ Believing it was the design of the Legislature to pay us what would be right_ We appealed to the call session of 1832 the honorable members passed a special act for our benefit on 19th of october 1832 making it the duty of R.P. Baker and David A. Dedrick to meet us at those

rapids and settle with us for all the work done by us in the years 1831 and 1832 with interest on our money_ We accordingly notified Baker and Dedrick to meet us in behalf of the state and settle with us accordingly to the act but those commissioners refused to meet and act on the part of the state_ We trust that the pride of the state will not suffer our claim to pass off in this way_ In your address to both houses of the Legislature should you deem it advisable to recommend some course whereby our claim can be settled and despensed dispensed with the favor will be acknowledged at all times by me_ John C. Haley September 9th 1836
