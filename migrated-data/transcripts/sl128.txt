Clover Dale January 12th 1840 Dear Sister Give my love to Martha and say that I will give her a full letter shortly. I received your letter of Dec 19th and being always pleased to hear from you, its kind contents was well received, although I would rather you had delayed writing a few days longer until my last epistle had reached you, and then you would not have had so much cause to censure me.

than we usually do in the holidays There was a select company of near twenty invited to Squire Caldwell 's on Christmas evening, as the greater part of the young people were professors of religion, the evening was spent in innocent amusements and instructive conversation. The ensueing ensuing day I invited the company to my Fathers, where they spent the time very agreeably, in this way we paid our annual associated visits to the most of our neighbours neighbors . New Year's day I made a sleigh (not such a one as you are in the habit of seeing) but for this part of the very genteel. I geared up two waggon wagon horses, and accompanied by Margaret Mary Smith and Mary Mills , we took a circuitous route of seven miles to Squire Caldwell s, the next day we increased our number to eight, and had a few upsets for a variety . The pond in front of the house was frozen three inches deep, and in fine order for skating. I had received a present of a pair of skates from Nashville a few days before, and had fine amusement, as it was the first evolutions I had performed on the ice in several years, it was quite a novelty and like
