Jan January the 25th 1843 Mr House I understand Dr Doctor Burk has left you his agent. I took his pills last fall and think I derived some benefit from taking them, and am of the opinion that I would have been cured if it had not have been for a fall that I got off of my Horse in a pond, afterwards I was afraid to continue the medicine, as it laid me very liable to cold. I am now very anxious to give them a fare trial, and would like to have your advice about when to take them if it is so that you can let me have the pills at home it will be a great accommodation to me as I would much prefer taking at home and I would obligate myself in a bond of five thousand dollars that they never should be seen while I am taking them. I hope if it is in your power you will let me have them and if they cure me it is within your power to charge me what ever you ask. I am willing to ask give any price to git get well write to me and let me know if I can get them and whether you think it would be advisable to take them now. my disease is mercurial and I think from the cures that I saw perform the medicine will cure me. when I left Dr Burk he gave me some of the weak pills to take
