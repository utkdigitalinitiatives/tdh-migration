Washington March 14 1850 Dear Sir Your last letter enclosing certificate of Clerk of Court as to his search and inability to find license bond of Mr & Mrs Kendricks with accompanying letter was duly received and the Papers immediately enclosed to Mr Edwards with my request for prompt action to which he has not yet answered I received last night from Mr Edwards the enclosed letter and copy of Pension Laws with his decision as to the application of the Heirs of Mrs Brent . as the Pension Laws were too bulky to be forwarded to you I have extracted the opinion of Mr Legare referred to in the Letter of Mr E Edwards and enclosed it to you with his letter I am sorry for his decision. but it cannot be prevented â€” No prospect of any settlement of slavery question as yet You hear much of compromise. but all is yet dark and dangerous Yrs Yours Respectfully Andrew Ewing
