Columbia Institute Saturday Oct. October 10th 1840 Dear Papa & Mama. You wrote to me that you had received only one letter from me since I arrived here; but this will be the fourth that I have written. I wrote an answer to my sister's on last Wednesday. O! I was so much pleased to receive a letter from her, and it was written so well I wish that I could receive one from brother John . O! I was so very happy to hear that Aunt Narcissa is coming up. I hope that she will not get out of the notion; for if she does I shall be so much disappointed. I shall look for her on Thursday; I wish that you both would come up with her. I had commenced school before I received your last letter. I have been enjoying very health ever since I commenced school. I remain your affectionate daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester Col. Robt. Colonel Robert J. & Elizabeth Chester P.S.

Mr Brinkley arrived here yesterday but I have not seen him yet. I want to see him because he came from
