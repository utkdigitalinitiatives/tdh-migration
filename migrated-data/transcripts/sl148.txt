Frankfort: Kenty Kentucky Jan January 8 1820 Dear Sir Since you were here nothing has occurred worthy of particular notice. As yet nothing further has been done with relation to our Claim in Woodford . I have seen some of my brothers in Law, and have heard that some one or two of the persons on the Land would perhaps compromise, but are so little interested as to offer terms which would be no consequence or inducement to accept — There is an attempt now making in the Legislature to amend the occupying Claimant Law so as ⁁ to have the Land valued at the time of the occupants settling on it; This if passed of which I am afraid will be in amount taking away the Land from the person suing — upon consultation together, on the subject of this Law and the propriety of compromising should it pass, I am requested by some of the heirs to know whether you would be willing either

to purchase or to sell out — in as much as the Land if in the hands of one could be managed to better advantage — We presume that if either the alternatives of buying or selling was presented you would prefer selling as your residence & your property is in Tennessee — From the Surveyors plate, It appears that Biun 's claim owned by Greeney 's which we have lost is about 700 acres; That from the manner that Court of appeals say The survey should be made (even if we should ever recover) we will lose at least 500 acres more — this added to what you and my father have sold will make about 1700 acres which would leave you say 1600 acres or thereabout — The glorious uncertainty of the Law may take away even that — Should you be disposed to sell out your title only, you will please write and let me know how much you have sold &c et cetera and also the price you would be willing to

take for your remaining interest — Should we Consider it under all circumstances a fair and reasonable price in what we consider at the best a risqing bargain; I will inform you either of our acceptance or rejection of it — The occupying Claimant Law is so unfavourable unfavorable to those suing, that we are not disposed to risk much, and you know the quality of the Land — None of us have even seen it — You will let us hear from you as soon soon as convenient — In the mean time I shall do all things necessary to bring things to a close, but I am persuaded in any event that the Claim will never be settled but by compromise unless we advance large sums for Improvements made on the Land — Yours &c et cetera R. J. Todd I shall be in this place about 4 or 5 weeks longer, but you can write to me either here or in Lexington .
