Jackson Ten Tennessee 7 Octr October 40 My Dear Child The recpt receipt of your most anxiously looked for letter came yesterday and released us from a load such as we never before felt—. It came while Genl General Jackson and all the family were at our house to dine— you know what a crowd— & my child you can only imagine the joy it gave us. You must not be astonished that your Aunt Narcissa, has now declined coming up to see you, for the present— since you are so well you must go to school and her coming would only divert your attention from your studys—. I will be up myself in a few weeks. If you are perfectly restored to health you must go to school, but not until you are strong & healthy— Our object in being separated from you is that you may get yr your Education & that must be the great business of yr your absence—. The carriage has been arranged and all things ready for a start , waiting the coming of your letter— that letter gave us such relief— now we are happy— I write in haste
