Steamer Palo Alto 19th Sept / 48 Dear Edward & Benj Benjamin After we left you on the bank at Hanover Landing We had a very Pleasant Trip to Cin Cincinnati on the Ben Franklin The next morning We took a Carrage Carriage and went to walnut Hills to Breakfast. I found the Phoenix Landing and would Leave for Memphis the next day (last Thursday) and I thought of going on her but when the Time came for her starting I found She had so much Load on that it was doubtful whether she would be able to get out, as the river is so very Low & I concluded to wait for a smaler smaller Boat or a rise in the river — If I had met the Stephens as I wished I could not have gon gone home on her as she is now aground below Louisville I am on a medeum medium sized stern wheel St Louis Boat which is making a Trip to Memphis as there are so many Passangers Passengers & so much Freight for that place — We left Cin Cincinnati 4 P.M yesterday and have been aground 10 Hours on Warsaw Bar but are now under way Just above Carralton — Your mother will wait for more water if it is 3 weeks She has a very pleasant Boarding place
