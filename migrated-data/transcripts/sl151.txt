Frederickburg Fredericksburg , July 22, 1835 — Dear Brother: I am happy to inform you that I arrived here on the evening of the 4th July without accident to myself or horse, and without the least inconvenience or sickness to myself or horse. I found Adelaide and the children in perfect health, and the girls also. They have grown very much, you would not know the girls. I wrote Butler on my arrival here, and awaited for him one week, whin when I became somewhat impatient, I then went in search of him, and after two days hard riding I found him. He had met with an accident which had prevented him from attending to business for some months and had two weeks prior to my arrival, engaged with a gentleman by the month. I told him and the gentleman that it was actually necessary for him to leave in a few days, — he told me he would try so to do on monday that was on Thursday, and that he would be up on Monday the same day, in the Steamboat, but here it is near that day week and I have not seen or heard from him since. He seems to be anxious to go out, and says James is determined to leave Virginia this fall. I wrote Richard to come up with Mary as soon as possible, so I could fix her, by the time Butler was ready but I have not as yet heard of or seen him. Our family are the most stupid and tardy species of creation His conduct here was of ⁁ the cast you and myself judged it be. We were not mistaken in our suspicions, if Laura and Rebecca are to be believed. Adelaide says she thinks so too, but says the lowest and most vulgar were his associates — He

came to her on Sunday to fix his clothes after idleing idling all the week off which, she refused, as it was not of much consequence, — She had done all the day before, as she thought. She sent for him and talked to him about conducting himself in the manner he did. He was driving a butchers cart about the town, and she was told of it, and sent for him and told him that he was disgracing his sisters, after which he left — Driving a cart with meat to every one's door, without intending to learn the business. Watch him, he can do right if he wants — He thinks hard of Adelaide, Laura, and Rebeca Rebecca because they would talk to him. L. Laura and R. Rebecca says he was very dissepated dissipated . Adelaide got her cousin young Edwards to see him start, and told him never to show his face in that place again !!! Richard intends this fall to move South, I will see him, and talk to him. Dr. Buchanan is very uneasy here, he told me in the street that he had to sell a negro or two a year to live. Our conversation relative to my coming out there next spring meets Adelaide's wishes in every particular, her Brother has got his business in such a fix that he could not settle it up sooner than two years, though he intends to move to Alabama , after he can settle his business. If you can purchase me a lot in that town below the Mussel Muscle Shoals or the other side of the River, which is to be sold in August, I think it would be desirable; It might be got cheap I think,— though you must judge whether lots purchased at the sale then will be an object hereafter. I only wish to rimind remind you of it, and for you to act accordingly, for I should not like to improve others Lots.

I should not have known my children if they had not been with their mother. Richard is the finest Boy in the State, — has more natural sense than any child I ever saw at his age — Virginia equally as much so. Roger left me about 60 miles the other side of Knoxville , I had no company the rest of the way, nor I did not want any for I would have had to break my mode of travelling had I travelled with others. He is quite a fine fellow I think, — give my respects to him. — Adelaide sends her love to Sister and you and the children. Tell Clay that Virginia is nearly as large as he is. Remember me to Sister and the Children, Hugs, &C et cetera — And believe me your Brother Andrew B. Beckwith Dr. Fitzburgh asked after you, and Mrs. Buchanan . Huch tells a lie about Dr. Buchanan, the girls says he treats them as well as they would deserve. — Also she, Mrs. B. Buchanan A. B. B. Andrew B. Beckwith
