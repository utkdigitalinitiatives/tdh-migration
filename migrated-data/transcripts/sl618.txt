Memphis May 24 1842 Dear sir I hasten to inform you that chancellor M Campbell has dissolved the injunctions obtained by the state to secure the states lien upon the property of the Lagrange and Memphis Rail Road and if something is not done the consequences will be ruinous not only to the individual stock holders but to the state. If the property of the company is forced to sale for cash my opinion is that the state will run the hazzard hazard of losing her whole stock__ I have heretofore rested contended as I presumed no chancellor would refuse to enforce the states lien. It would therefore be well to consult the attorney general and see whether any thing can be done. I understand the Chancellor will not grant an appeal without security which of course the state can not give Respectfully Eastin Morris, Pres President L&M RR Co Rail Road Company His Excellency James C. Jones Please answer immediately
