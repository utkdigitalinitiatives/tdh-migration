Nashville , Ten. , Sept. 25, 1840 . } Dear Sir: _ As the Presidential contest approaches its close, the importance of vigilant and united action on the part of the Democratic Republicans becomes more and more manifest. The Federalists' conscious that their existence as a party depends on the election of General Harrison , are resorting to all the means which talent and money can command to secure a majority of votes for him; and if their exertions are not counteracted by timely efforts on our part to guard the freedom and purity of the ballot box, they may be successful. Under these circumstances, we think it our duty to remind you of the necessity of watching the polls on the day of the election so as to prevent frauds. For this purpose, we recommend the appointment of a committee at each precinct in every county, whose duty shall be to have printed Tickets for the use of every Democratic Voter, containing the names of the Democratic Electors; and on whom should be enjoined the task of visiting as far as practicable every voter friendly to our cause, and of urging upon him the necessity of vindicating his principles at the ballot box. The outrages practised at the polls in New Jersey , at Philadelphia , and other portions of the Union, in the elections of the year 1839 , teach us what we are to expect when Federalists have control of the ballot box. Even force is already threatened by some of the prominent leaders of that party, under the hope, doubtless, that there are Democrats who may be deterred by such means from appearing at the polls. Let it be our pride to teach these myrmidons of the Money Power that it is impossible thus to stifle the voice of American Freemen. In the language of the immortal Jefferson let us teach the Federalists once more that corruption is as harmless now as it is was in his day when "Truth was free to combat errors of opinion." From a conviction that the present crisis calls for all our energies, our most talented and efficient Speakers will be engaged in visiting the various portions of the State until the day for voting arrives. We must therefore look to them for the employment of the proper means to keep up spirited discussion in their neighborhoods, and wherever they go in the various portions of the State; the effect of which will be to satisfy every Democrat that he will not do his duty to himself or his country unless he goes to the polls and there gives his vote boldly and fearlessly for the Electors pledged to the support of Martin Van Buren , the candidate of the Republican Party. Felix Robertson Chairman of the Corresponding Central Committee.
