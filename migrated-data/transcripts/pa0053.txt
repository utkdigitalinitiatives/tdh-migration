Athens Decr. December 7, 1836 The treaties made between the United States and the Cherokee tribe of Indians in the years 1817 and 1819 and the legislation of the State of Tennessee consequent thereupon, produced in a number of the courts of said State, many and very important law suits, between the nations of that tribe & Citizens of Tennessee, touching the validity of sending reservations of land taken in virtue of those treaties- Litigation in relation to those subjects commenced as far back as 1814- and no suits in our Courts involved questions more important or interesting whether viewed in relations to the value of the property involved or the magnitude and differently of the subjects discussed- As such importance was the matter esteemed by the State of Tennessee herself, that she selected her ablest Counsel to respresent her interests in that behalf.- The undersigned are cognizant of the fact, that throughout the whole of this litigation, Spencer Jarnagen Esqr. Esquire appeared as Council Counsel for the Cherokees generally and that he bestowed upon the causes a faithful & vigilant attention- and that he has also within the period aforesaid attended to other important causes for several of the Cherokees, with like vigilance & attention.

Amongst the latter class of cases may be named that of the State vs. Springton & Foreman for the Murder of John Walker - The foregoing litigation in our Courts has ranged from the year 1821- up to this time and we take pleasure in voluntarily making the foregoing statement, and of further adding that two hundred and fifty dollars per annum, would not exceed a very reasonable compensation for Mr. Jarnagin's services- Tho.
