Memphis 30th Nov November 1847 Dear Edward— We have been much pleased in Recieving Receiving Letters from you so frequently and have to regret that our Letters to you have not been more numerous, I wrote the day after we reached Home & Benjamin the week following and the next week I should have written so that you would have got a Letter from one of us every week my Business on my arival arrival was so pressing that I neglected to write one week longer than I should but my purpose is to give you 2 letters a month from this forward — We recd received a Letter from Mary last Saterday Saturday at the same time yours of the 15th came to hand She said she had recd received a Letter from you a few days before. She was well and well pleased with her Home & School. It affords us Hapiness Happiness that you are both so well pleased and have so good an oportunity opportunity for Improving your minds and fitting yourselves for future usfulness usefulness .— In your Letter you Mention recieving receiving a Protest for Non payment of Mr Hinds Acceptance for 100$ It gives me no further trouble than that Mr Jones should be delayed the paymt payment due him for a few days believing as I do that there must have been some Mistake in the acceptance having been presented to Mr Hinds in Person for I remited remitted to him the amount on my arival arrival Home and whether He had recieved received it or not He would have payed paid the amt amount on Presentation. I feel confident the money is Paid before this.

While I am on the Subject of mony money I will say that the prospect of my Ever getting any thing of the Farmer & merchant Bank on their Protested Check of 600$ is every day becoming worse & the amount of 250$ Mr Starr remited remitted to me in Connecticut has never been returned here or even heard from, What can have become of the Letter is a Mistery Mystery . The low price of Cotton (it haven having fallen one half in six weeks) makes business very dull Here, and money very Hard to be obtained. There has been no failures among our Merchants as yet, and Houses continue to Rent, Mr Mead Retains the Store He had last year— so does Mr Lamb . The New store built this Sumer Summer is finished and Mr Hinkle is moving into it today The Foundry is caried carried on as it was last year — “That little piece of Humanity,” as you call her in the Letter before the last recd received , and which was entirely neglected to be mentioned in your last is growing finely, is very Healthy & very Handsome , I wonder how you could have forgotten Her, She lets no one forget where she is but claims much attention. Your Mother has hardly left the House Except on sabaths sinc sabbaths since we reached Home. The Same Day of the Month was set apart as a day of Thanksgiving & Prayer in this state as in Connecticut Mr Coons gave us an Excellent Excelent discourse from the 1 V Verse of the 118 Psalm I think it one of his best efforts we have solicited a Copy for Publication if He consents I will send you one when Printed

Yourself & Sister were missed from our Thanksgiving Dinner, but our Harts Hearts were filled with Adoration and Thankfulness for the Evidence we have for believing that although seperated separated by space our Harts Hearts were united in sincere Thanksgiving to Almity Almighty God for his many Blessing the past year to us as a Famely Family , In sustaining through Dangers seen & unseen.. Temperal Temporal , & Spiritual, In giving us another Child, you another Sister, In having guided us in the selection of Places for your future Instruction which if Properly improved, will fit you both for Exerting an Influences for good which will not end with time but reach far on in Eternity. We were truly glad to heare hear of your determination to Leave of smoking — I pray God to Sustain you in this Resolution, and More Especially are we anxous anxious Since by your acknowledgment you had become so much under the Influence of Tobaco Tobacco , as to effect your nerves, your Apetite Appetite and your spirits, As you Value your own Health, Your and Our Hapiness Happiness , never breake the Pledge you have signed against Smoking — never, never , — As to a Guardian I am at a loss to know who to appoint not knowing the The the special duties devolving on that Office, I had thought of appointing your Unkle Uncle Bradley as He is Most frequently in Bridgport Bridgeport But your Mother Sugests Suggests that Miss Julia be charged with that most important Office. And as to Monthly Pocket Money, I now send you $5.00 & you & Mr Jones must fix the monthly allowance and if there is an Arbiter Necessary Call in Miss Julia, & when you write let me know the amt amount concluded on. I think the amt amount Should not Exceed 2$
