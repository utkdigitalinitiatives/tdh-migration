New Orleans June 9th 1849 Dr Dear Alex I have made inquiries as to the mode of selling negroes in this state and find that if you refuse to garantee guarantee the qualities of the negro except the title & health the law does not provide for a recovery against you on account of bad habits, and you can safely send your boy Henry here for sale, but this is a bad time of the year to sell & negroes are now very low. Memphis is said to be a good market. If you conclude to send him here I will do all I can to sell him to the best advantage, By the bye speaking of buying negroes I would like to purchase from you Emily and Mu??ch her daughter ( you got ⁁ them from Clinton Heslep .) It has always been the wish of Mrs C Coffee — and myself to repurchase them whenever we were able to do so, and I will feel it a particular obligation if you will let me take them off of your hands. I know nothing of the Cotton Market, for I never enquire about it. The overflow of the city still continues though it has not increased for some time You have no doubt seen accounts of the death of the old hero Gen General Gaines , he was to old to be of Service to the country, but he was so proud a man that he is a serious loss to us Give my regards to Ann, Ma & the family and be Your Brother Andrew J. Coffee
