Near Woodville June the 1st 1831 Dear Brother , After a long silence I once more address you a few lines to inform you that myself & family & Brother George and his family are at this time enjoying the blessing of common health, & hope that these few lines may find you & your family and all our family connections in your part of country enjoying the same blessing. The last summer was very dry in this country & corn crops were not generally good but the late rains made generally very good crops of cotton. The last winter was the severest that I have seen in this country & the early part of spring very wet & we are now suffering for the want of the rain. I have nothing to say on political subjects only that our State does not go with South Carolina in its nullifying policy; although most of our Citizens think the tariff of the United States is oppression in the Southern section of the Union, but they still think it a small evil compared to civil war with its accompanying horrors. Please give our most affectionate respects to my aged Mother, Brothir Brother & Sistir Sister Anderson & accept them for yourself & family, remember us affectionately to Aunt Duffill and all our relatives in your section of country. Please to write as often as convenient you know the difficulty that I labour labor under in writing from my hand being crippled, but you could write frequently. I remain with respect your affectionate brother Wm William Brown
