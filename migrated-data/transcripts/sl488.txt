Cairo 21st January 1819 Dear Sir Would it not be well to endeavour to get a post office established at the Bluff , at present to branch off from the Chickasaw agency, untill a direct road is opened from one of the post towns on this side Tennessee river I have no doubt this object may be accomplished by writing in to members of Congress, more especially when Genl General Jackson is there (at washington ) if asked to use his influence, If you concur in opinion with me you will please to address your friends in Congress on this subject and I will do the same I am not insinuating that I am to name commissioners to you for a certain purpose which shall be done in time I have not yet heard from Baltimore on the subject of the claim of the house of Mrs Winchester as soon as I do you shall hear from me. most respectfully Your ob obedient ' Servant J James Winchester Judge Overton attended to by J.O. and a Post office established from Reynolds house to the Bluff
