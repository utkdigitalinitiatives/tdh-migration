East Tenn. Tennessee College , Knoxville April 20th 1837 Dear Brother Charles, after having been so long silent I am at a great loss to know how the commence addressing you.- For it would seem that I have no grounds upon which to make a due and plausible apology.- But I have been busily engaged; and am situated in a retired and secluded place, where I seldom see company or news papers; consequently it is not often I am possessed of such information as would prove interesting to a correspondent.- However let us dispense with this apology, for it has already been sufficiently protracted.- The examination in this institution took place two weeks since.- It has been customary in this as in all other chartered institutions to have one exhibition at the close of the examination; but on this occasion in its stead the two rival Societies held their anniversaries; and they are said to have thrown in the shade every thing in the line

of an exhibition that has been seen in the town.- you will see an account of it in the Register I sent Henry; I had also made arrangements for and to be sent you, but through a mistake it was sent to Jacksonville .- Monroe and myself are continuing on College- hill this vacation.- He is employed in the practical part of Surveying; I am principally employed in reading.- The period of our state elections is drawing near; and the candidates in this section are urging their pretentions pretensions with considerable warmth.- Joseph L. Williams and Robt. Robert Anderson are running for Congress in this district.- Graves has no opponent as yet for the Senate; nor has Crosier opposition to represent this county in the house- Col. Colonel Havron of this Co. County and Mjr. Major John Smith of Roane are offering for floating number.- I believe but two are running in Roane, Stocton and Carter .- On Monday last the Hon. Honorable Bolig Peyton delivered a speech to a large congregation composed of both sexes from this town and its vicinity.- He is not an avowed candidate for Governor

but will be; and will receive the support of Judge White 's friends I would say to sister Caroline, that I now begin to attach much belief to her remark, that girls were curious creatures.- I am the more disposed so at present from the fact, that my own sister in whom I reposed so much confidence, having been lately seized with an amorous fit, became engaged in marriage to a gentleman, and actually consecrated herself his own peculiarly; and the matter was announced in the public prints and she had almost departed with him to a different state before I was apprised of the fact.- I do not mean to complain, for I had some knowledge that such an arrangement had been attempted; but I mention this circumstance merely to show my strong conviction, that girls are in some aspects strange creatures.- Since the subject of matrimony has been introduced I would mention I saw Mr K. Love about two months since; and he informed me that Mr. J. V. Mitchell had written him a letter informing him that his father was again married; but lately I have been induced to believe it was only a jocke joke .- Mr. Love was in good health &c. et cetera - I wish my respects to be presented to sister Caroline Margaret E. & brother H. I. Henry Inman and I hope you will accept of the same from your affectionate brother Fred. Frederick A. Welcker To Charles F. Welcker Esqr. Esquire
