Colonel Folsom the Choctaws have lost one of the lights of that Nation, and the Government of the United States a steadfast friend, who has been the same at all times. Col. Colonel Folsom has filled every position that a citizen of the Choctaw Nation can fill under the constitution, and by the voice of his countrymen. Col. F. Colonel Folsom served as a leader of a party of Choctaw warriors against the Creeks , during the creek war, where his bravery and friendship to the United States rendered him a cherished object of Government favor. He was also under Gen. General Jackson at the surrender of Pensacola . He was the untiring advocate of religion and education, and had the high gratification before his death, to witness a moral and intellectual change among his people. [N. O. Pic. 21st.
