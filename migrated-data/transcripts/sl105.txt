Cornplanter Sept. September 1839 My dear Sister, Will you forgive me for not answering your last letter before this time I know you would, if you could have seen how very busy I have been for some weeks past. We have had 3 of Mr. Wm William Bells sons of Pittsburg Pittsburgh staying here for a month and only left two days ago. The oldest is 17 — and is a very promising youth, indeed they are all very interesting, and I am indebted to them for more of a home feeling than I have experienced since I have been here. Could I see more of our relations, particularly my own family or rather some of my father's I should be better reconciled to the seperation separation from the others. At present I feel quite low spirited, and am in constant dred dread that each mail will bring me an account of my father's death. Have you heard of the death of Mr. Smith husband of Cousin Eliza of Missouri ? he died on the 12th of July after an illness of only 24 hours, and left Eliza a widow with four children, and an aged mother

to provide for. she says if she had the means of going to Philadelphia , she could not go with her mother, she is so infirm she wrote to me 12 days after her husbands death, and then she had, not had any of her neighbors to visit her in her affliction, at least not one of them had staid stayed a night with her, she compl ained? very much of their neglect and says she does not find them like her Virginia neighbors were in trouble, Poor woman! how sincerely do I pity her, I wish she lived near to me, that I might be some comfort to her, I intend to ask her to let me have one of her daughters to raise for her, I will treat as if she were my own, with all a mother's fondness and tenderness, such as my lamented Aunt showed for me — if she will let me have one, and Mr Bell thinks she will, (you know Eliza is quite a favorite of his) and he will cheerfully do what he can for her, at present he cannot give any pecuniary aid though it will be some relief to have one of her children educated for her — I wish my father's circumstances would admit

of his aiding her, you know what obligations he owes to her for his mismanagement of her father's estate. Write to her it is the least you can do, to express that sympathy which I know you all feel We are all well here, and Mr Bell so very busy attending to the building of his Grist mill, that he scarcely takes time to eat or sleep; but living in a continual excitement agrees with him, he is well, and contented — You excuse me from writing any more this time, it is late on Saturday and I am so tired after the usual cleaning, and washing 13 windows that I feel a desire to rest — Remember me affectionately to all enquiring friends All this family unite in love to you all Why does not Wm William write to me? I fear he will become so wedded to his farm as to neglect some important duties, not to write to me is to neglect a duty, tell him, I say so, and if he knew how much I think, and speak of him he would consider me entitled to some token of his regard. Write soon, and believe me your very Affectionate Sister Jane
