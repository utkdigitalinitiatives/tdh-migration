Memphis Dec December 23rd 1842 Dr Dear Sir Yrs Yours of the 11th Inst Instant came duly to to to hand enclosing a check for $212 on the F & M Bank — I will keep the receipt signed by Mr Brinkly and myself until I see you — Mr Brinkly collected a few days since of Lou W Falbot his note due Jany January 10th 1841 for $666.66 with interest there on amounting to $744— One third of which I sent Br James a check for — you can take his receipt for the same and we will give you one when you come down I sold on yesterday 2 lots to Joseph J Andrews of the firm of Andrews & Brothers of New Orleans for $10.000— viz videlicet lot no number 79 Howards corner with its income ? that is I am not bound to give him possession until June 1846 and lot no 114 immediately back of said lot fronting in Main Street The terms were to be cash at first until he found out how long it would be before he could get possession then he backed out & the trade now stands this way He is to pay $25.00 down that is as soon as you will make him a title Bond to make

him a title — the balance $ 7500 payable three years after date with interest from date which is six months before we would have possession or before Howards Lease Runs out — Now in the event he never makes the last payment we have his $2500 & will get possession just as soon as if the trade had never been made — I was induced to sell him the lots by two reasons first ⁁ and principally because Mr Brinkly and myself both thought it was a very high price for them higher probably than any had been sold for here before and secondly I am compelled at this time to have some money to build a ferry Boat (2/3 of which $25.00 I will get) — I say compelled because I have failed in my attempt to rent it out I can get no responsible man to take it & to build is my only alternative — Now you know Maj Major Winchester is not in a situation to do so & the whole falls upon my shoulders — We have a proposition to sell us one at Pittsburg for $4.000 one half cash part of which we will put our old Engine in for now. New Albany the other half he is to retain possession of by putting an engineer on her until the whole is paid or they will run her as half owners and divide the profits — myself and Maj W Winchester are going to Pittburg Pittsburg so soon as I can hear from you and have her examined if she is good

as they represent her to be I think we will buy her — if we do not like her we will have one build immediately — Now I do not do this through choice it is a matter of necessity but I hope to make some money? It is also my wish when you sell Winchester negroes to buy his Boy ? his family & wife & child — he is a good fetch and will suit me very well provided I get him upon reasonable terms — This I do not want known — I hope the sale of the Lots and the terms will meet your approbation I send you this mail a title bond drawn up as agreed upon for you to sign & send back to me also two bank drafts which by the title bond is made payable to you — you will please endorse it and make it payable to my order on the back — so as I can get the money upon it — I will send Br James 1/3 of the same — Andrew is very responsible — The title Bond shall not be delivered until the draft is paid — So soon as I hear from you, which I hope will be as soon as possible, Maj Winchester & myself are going to Pittsburg — Present my best respect to cousin Mary and believe yr your friend and relative J John Overton
