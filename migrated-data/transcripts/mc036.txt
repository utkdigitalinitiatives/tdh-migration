Memphis 21st July 1846 My Dear Wife— I came across the river last evening into the city, and was met with congratulations upon my appointment as chief of Genl. General Pillows staff. He sent for me and tendered me the appointment— which I declined because I hated to leave my company⁁ I was urged & I however finally concluded to accept it— I am now with Genl. General Pillow⁁ as his aid at the Commercial Hotel— and we will take the first St. Steam Boat, for New Orleans — As far as the comfort of the service is concerned I shall be in clover— Yesturday Yesterday & to-day I have had the piles, which has rendered me very uncomfortable— Our surgeon is a particular friend of mine, & he has prescribed for me & says I will be well in a day or two— I met at the dinner table to-day with Mrs. Judge Brown ( Mrs Boylan that was) had a brief conversation with her at table— & a few minutes ago, prepared a visiting card to call upon her, when the steamer came in view— & I now write this while the Genl. General has gone to procure a passage for us— I will write you again from Orleans— Please write to me immediately direct to New Orleans— My love to all Yr Your Affectionate Husband Wm. R. William Richard Caswell I am very anxious to hear from you.
