Jackson April 14th 1826 Dear friends! Since my Last of the 31st inst instant , I am in possision possession of your favour favor of the 23 of March. In reply of your questions about business in general here, I reply, that I think there is great & good prospects, for men of Capital in this place as well as in the surrounding country. At this time there are Seven Stores in Jackson, they are all doing a good buseniss business , beside Madison County (our county) which is settled mostly by wealthy people, there are from three to four Counties more, who do their trading in this Place — Jackson has considerably the Start of another town in the district, & I have no doubt will keep it for many years to come At present there is no Store Rooms or house to be had immediately on the Public Square; but as one of the Merchants is about to sell out, there might be a probability of getting his house, which is a good Stand on the Square near the courthouse yet unless application be made shortly, some body somebody else will rent it, as there is a talk of some new Store to come here; house rent is very high and not less than from 12 to 15 dollars or more a

a month by the year; Board & Lodging is three dollars & a half & without Lodgen Lodging three dollars per Week. — We get our goods by the way of the Mississippi River , they ⁁ are landed at George C. Barfields at the Canadian Reach, Arkansas . T. four miles above the mouth of Forked Deer River , on the Mississippi from there they ⁁ are forwarded in Reel Boats to this place; the freight from the Miss. Mississippi to Jackson is from 62 ½ cents to 75 per hundred pounds — they are landed one mile from town, and have to be hauled in wagons that short distance — The distance from the mouth of the Forked D Deer to Jackson is two hundred miles by water and one of the disagreablest most disagreeable River to navigate I ever Saw. — The nearest point from here to Tennessee River is about Sixty miles from here, & the best Landing would be Reynoldburg on Tens. Tennessee River, from which place good would have to be wagoned at the rate of $1.50 to $1.75 or $ 2 per 100 . — The Forked Deer is not navagable navigable all the year, but only in Spring and at the time of high freskes , yet it keeps up generaly generally untill until some time in May. — My advise would be, for one of you, to come first to this country & see yourself & take a rout route through the district and see the little Towns & their prospecks prospects . —

The last news from N. New Orleans are very discouraging cotton is selling there from 6 to 9 ¢ — this will have some influence in selling of goods, as money will be scarse scarce . Besides the Land office will open here on the 1st day of May to enter land at 50 ¢ per acre and will swap a great part of our circulating medium — yet after all this, there is still a great opening for men of Capital in sundry Speculation, & if I had only the funds, I could make money here, but the way I am situated from hand to mouth, I have to tipple the best way I can, yet hope to come out yet some day — I have told you now enough to give you some ensight insight of the Situation of this country & you can take your measures accordingly — In your letter I might have exspected expected something about my business I left with you, but ⁁ you did not even mention it — in my Last I requested you to collect the Notes and amounts the shortest way possible, I repeat the same, & would thank you when you write to me again to let me know what the prospects are — I remain your friend Charles L. Barth P.S. Post Script If the French cook of Elliot Bachee would still be about there ask him if he would come & live with me as a Baker & confectioner?? C.L.B—
