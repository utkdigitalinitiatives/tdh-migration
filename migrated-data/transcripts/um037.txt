Paradise Lagrange Ala. Alabama March 21, 1845 Dear Brother & Sister — : Your letter was received by the last mails. Is is needless to add the recitals of home were perused with interest. You intimated an apology for writing on fools cap paper, this was unnecessary, for I would that all the communications that I receive were were were spread out on these lengthy sheets, containing every variety of news calculated to call up fond apreciation appreciation , for it is nearly a luxury to the student's mind wearied down by clasic classic studies on metaphisical metaphysical sciences to have his attention diverted from these continuous themes, and indulge his thoughts in contemplating the happy scenes about his indeared endeared home. You perceive that I have followed your example in my selection of lecter lecture pa paper, not that I have so much to write but for another reason that will manifest itself in the sequel, For, for the life of me I dont know what to write that would interest or amuse you.

Though heavy frost this morning has whitened our mountain tops. The resplendant resplendent sun has shone forth in all her grandieur grandeur , as if, bespeaking her warmth wont no more be extinguished by the northern blast, the cherful birds have resumed their musical notes that have been hushed by the recent colds; as hailing the happy morn of spring. So the planter to his fields — The ladies to their gardens, and the student with renewed energy to his studies, so gone by — Sister Susan my imagination was scarce suficiently sufficiently vivid to paint that beautiful & amicable creture creature seen in the person of your lovely babe. & more especially as you would not grant the privilege of contrast with the unindentified drawing but as she is so fond of Memphis I shall cease to number her on my list of fairy beauties. her silph sylph like form & siren voice shall & ever will delight the fancy of others, while Bob pursues his destined course. You mentioned something about Mary & Julia . Tell pa: he has a son that has experienced the inconvenience & increased expense of changing shools schools . I love my church, It is my pleasure to see her institutions prosper, But consider either circumstances. With your permishion permission I will write to brother Kent on the next page as he requested a corispondence correspondence of this sort. You can bet him was that without showing him this my respects to inquiring friends Bob
