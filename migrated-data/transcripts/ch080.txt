Washington City Nov 11, 1857. Hon Honorable Sec. of the Treasury, Sir, As the attorney of the North Carolina Cherokees permit me to present for your consideration an act of Congress passed in their favor which bears date July 29, 1848 , and two decisions made thereon by two of your predecessors, Messr. Messieurs Mr. Corwin Mr. Guthrie the former establishing a construction which was reversed by the latter, to the great injury of the Indians. The act referred to will be found in the 9th vol U S. laws, page 264. Sec. 4. Be it enacted c et cetera That the Secretary of War cause to be ascertained the number and names of such individuals and families including each member of every family of the Cherokee nation of Indians that remained in the State of North Carolina at the time of the ratification of the treaty of New Echota , May twenty three eighteen hundred and thirty six , and who have not removed west of the Mississippi , or received commutation for removal and subsistance subsistence , and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury: Thereupon the Secretary of the Treasury shall set apart, out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated

Page 2

a sum equal to fifty three dollars and fifty three cents for each individual ascertained as aforesaid and that he cause to be paid to every such individual or his or her legal representative interest at the rate of six, percent per annum on such per capita from the said twenty third day of May eighteen hundred and thirty six to the time of the passage of this act and continue annully annually thereafter the said payment of interest at the rate aforesaid. Under the recited act the census was taken and the sum of 53.33 set apart in the Treasury for each Cherokee embraced on the Census Roll prepared by Maj Major John C. Mullay , which in the aggregate amounted to 80.901.61 In the year of 1850 , as the attorney of the North Carolina Cherokees I made application to the second auditor for the payment of interest due to the legal representatives of deceased Cherokees , for whom the investment had had had been made. The auditor refused to make payment and

Page 3

referred the question of payment to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Hon Honorable Wm M. Meredith . The letter of the second Auditor making the reference bears date 9th Jan. 1850 and is hereunto appended marked, A. The letter of the 2d 2nd Auditor It was referred to the 2d 2nd Comptroller for his decision thereon, by the Secretary of the Treasury. On the 12th of Janurary January his decision of the question was made as shown by his letter of that date hereunto appended marked B, in which he decided that the interest had to be paid to the legal representatives of the Indians while the Government as trustee retained the possession of the fund. He says, to use his own language, in case of the death of a person interested in the fund the legal representative of such person would succeed to his rights and might claim the interest so long as the fund continued. This is in accordance with the language of the 4th section.

This decision was adopted by the Secretary of the Treasury Wm. M. Mr Meredith and concurred in to effect by his successor the Hon Honorable Ths. Thomas H Corwin , and by his assistant Mr Hodge , as shown by his letter to Col A M Mitchell the disbursing agent under date of July 14, 1851 , hereunto appended marked C. In which specific instructions are given with reference to making payment to the legal representatives of deceased Cherokees , you will be governed by the following general principles To all Indians of lawful age now living payment of the respective sums due to each to be made to the Indians direct. All sums due to minor children now deceased to be paid to the parents of living. In cases of deceased wife or husband the amount due to be paid to the Survivor. In all such instances where the deceased left neither husband nor wife (as the case may be) then to be paid to the

Page 5

legal representative Under these instructions the payments were made and the amount of the agent settled and thus approved by the accounting offices of the Treasury Department. On the 3rd of March 1853 , Mr Corwin went out and Mr Guthrie came in to office, from that date I am inclined to believe that in the year 1853 an examination of your office will prove that the principle adopted of paying the interest of deceased Cherokees to their legal representatives received the sanction of Mr Guthrie himself. Be that as it may, on the 15th of Jan 1854 Mr Guthrie by himself or most probably by a subordinate in his office, attempted the change of the construction of the law and the established practice under it and to reverse the decision of his predecessors Messr Messieurs Mr. Wm. M. Meredith Mr. Corwin and the accounting officers of the Treasury department,

Evidence of which is found in the instructions to the agent Jas James W Terrell , appointed to pay the interest under date of Jan 15th 1854 , hereunto appended marked D which for reasons herein after set forth it is presumed should be set aside and the first construction of the law adopted in the payment of the interest now remaining deed. In the instructions referred to which appear to have been signed; but never examined by Mr Guthrie , the following is the then opinion upon the payment of the interest It has been decided that the annuity in every case ceases with the death of the Indian, and that the proper representative of such Indian can receive only the annuity up to the time of his death. In all such cases therefore you will make the compensation at the rate of 6.39, per annum from the 29th of July 1851 to

Page 7

the day of the death of the Indian and pay the representatives of the amount due according to such computation instead of the amount assumed to be due in the statement. The foregoing opinion contains conclusive evidence that Mr Guthrie never examined either it or the law to which it refers, I will repeat the evidence on which this assertion is based. The law made provision for the payment of six percent interest upon the sum of 53.33, which gives as the annual payment 3.19 98/100. In the opinion of Mr Gutherie or one of his subordinates it is said after stating that the interest would not be paid after the death of the Indian, it is stated that the agent would make the rate of compensation at the rate of 6.39 per annum, from the 29th of July 1851 to the day of the death of the Indian , can any one imagine that the HonHonorable Secretary of the Treasury of the United States would have committed this error if he had

Page 8

examined either the law or the opinion. If he had examined the law he would have seen that it was but six percent allowed the Indian, giving annual annuity of 319. 98/100, if he had examined the decision he would have seen that it was allowing twelve instead of six percent interest double as much as authorized by the law. The conclusion therefore seems irresistable irresistible that the opinion over this signature was not his opinion because it will not do to adopt the opposite conclusion because then it would be supposed that he was incapable of calculating simple interest. But in addition to the absurd contradiction in the opinion reputed to Mr. Mr. Gutherie 's it is in direct opposition to the views entertained by Congress upon making payment to the Cherokees of the principal as shown by the act of 1855 chap 204

Page 9

page 700, And be it further enacted That the Secretary of the interior is hereby authorized and required to cause to be paid to the North Carolina Cherokees embraced in the roll of John C Mullay or the legal representative of each of them as have died since their enrolment enrollment the sum of fifty three dollars and thirty three cents respectively for the expenses of their removal and subsistence now held in trust by the United States , according to the terms of the 4th section of the act of twenty ninth July Annodomini eighteen hundred and forty eight . I have now shown that the accounting offices of the Treasury and his secretaries decided in favor of paying interest to the legal representative of the Indians while the Government retained the possession of the principal.

Page 10

I will now try to prove that neither Mr. Guthrie nor the President of the United States had any power to change the dicision decision of the accounting officers of the Treasury. To establish this position I beg to leave to refer you to the opinion of William Wirt Attorney General vol 1. p 624, given upon the construction of the laws establishing the Treasury Department, In which opinion he says, With regard to the comptroller it directs that is shall be his duty to superintend the adjustment and preservation of all public accounts settled by the Auditor and certify the balance arising thereon to the Register no right of appeal from his decision to the President , (see act of 3rd March 1809 , vol 4 p 221, sec 2) makes it the duty of the comptroller to direct the Auditor

Page 11

to audit and settle any particular amount and to report such settlement for his revision and final decision, so also the act of 3rd March 1817 , which introduces the present organization of the Treasury Department Thus in every instance the decision of the Comptroller is declared to be final and it is manifest that the law contemplates no further examination by any officer, after such decision. But in addition to law plain Justice is on the side of the Indian. The Government has his money and had also millions held in trust for the different tribes. If she can claim that the interest does not descend to the heirs and legal representatives of the North Carolina Cherokees may she not extend the decision to all the tribes, and thus defeat the objects of the Government in creating annuities.
