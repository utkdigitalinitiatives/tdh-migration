New Echota Cherokee Nation August 29th 1829 Dear Sir, Your communication of this date Containing the object of your visit to the Nation under instruction from the Secretary of War is received and maturely deliberated in on in Executive Councils Convened for the express purpose. The deep interest felt on the part of the President of the U. States for the removal of the Cherokees West of the River Mississippi is Known to the Nation, It is a subject that has often long since been submitted for consideration and been deliberated by the Councils of the Nation with all that solemnity its importance deserves, and the conclusion and result of those deliberations have been expressed in soberness sincerity to the Govt. of the U States , adverse to a removal- And We declare that those sentiments and disposition remain the same and are unchangeable; you state that you are instructed simply to propose, that We will agree to meet Commissioners to be appointed

by the President, at such time as may best suit the Convenience of both parties for the purpose of discussing the subject of the Cherokee removing West of the River Mississippi ; and that we would then have an opportunity of hearing the propositions of the Government. - It is deemed inexpedient to enter into a special agreement to meet Commissioners for the purpose of discussing the subject of the Cherokees removing West of the River Mississippi . When it is well known that the disposition of the Nation is adverse to a removal and that no proposition could be made to change their disposition as to induce them ever to enter into a treaty on the Subject- Especially as the proper authorities of the Nation are ever ready at all times to receive in the most friendly manner all public public functionaries of the U States that may be appointed by the President for the purpose of Submitting Subjects for our consideration. The Executive Department of the Nation will never neglect to attend to such business

during the recess of the Genl. General Council (as is manifest on the present occasion) and the Legislative Department during its session (which is convened annually on the second Monday of October) in like manner will always receive and act upon all Subjects submitted for their consideration decision . The right of Individual States exercising jurisdiction over the Territory solemnly secured Guarantied to the Cherokee Nation by treaty, is a subject that is certainly questionable The principles contained in the Constitution of the U. States the Treaties establishing relationships between the U. States the Cherokee Nation are in variance to the exercise of such a power by the State Government. We are aware that a decision on this important Subject must seal our fate in prosperity happiness or in missery misery and distruction destruction - But Confiding in the magnanimity justice of the United States , we place our dependence upon their plighted faith await the result We are happy

States in the Nation And that you will take occasion to Communicate this fact to the Prest. President of the U. States in contradiction to the slanderous reports circulated by the frontier News Papers prejudicial to the best interest of the Cherokee People.

States , who would, in case of actual war, prove more loyal to the cause of the U. States that the Cherokees . Yourself as well as the President of the U States have witnessed this fact realized during the late war With great pleasure we reciprocate your wishes for the future happiness of this Nation. In return you will please to accept the best wishes for your health happiness for the peace
