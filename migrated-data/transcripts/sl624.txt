Pulaski Dec December 28th 1842 Hond Honored James C Jones Gov Governor The Columbia , Pulaski, and Elkton & Alabama Turnpike Company, having been finished from Columbia to Elkton, as you will see by reference to the last report of the commissioners which has been forwarded, and I presume, now on file in the Secretary's office, and I must therefore request of you your warrant to open and receive at all the gates on said Turnpike road___. I find from examination, that the Turnpike Company have heretofore received your warrant to open and receive toll at five of the gates between Pulaski & Columbia we are by law entitled to one gate more between Pulaski & Columbia and three gates between Pulaski & Elkton, being of our gates which we wish the authority of the state to open, which will be nine in all from Columbia to Elkton___ As some of the gates have been changed, and the particular gates [unclear] not specified in the warrant heretofore issued, it would probably be better to issue a warrant for the whole in order to prevent any difficulty. Yours Respectfully Thomas M Jones President of said company
