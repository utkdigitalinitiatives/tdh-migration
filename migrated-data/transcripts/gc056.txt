Alexandria ( La Louisiana ) 24th Decr December 1850 Dear Col Colonel . I avail myself of a lazy moment to write you a few lines, & trust they will find all in the enjoyment of fine health after spending a merry christmas. But's health is not very good, Eve & myself are quite well. We got through rolling our crop our week ago, & in consequence of the extremely dry weather & a continuation of it so long, my crop did not yield mor more so well as we at first anticipated, I made 390.000 lbs pounds & about 700 barels barrels of molasses, although every crop was not good it was the best in our parish to the fored, and will I think nett me after paying transportation expenses, commissions &c&c something like $22,000, my corn crop is not so good, but believe I have enough. The Cotton crops very very much, some good, some tolerably so, & others very bad, but the price bring so good it remunerates the planters well, I should have made more at it than sugar this year, but it has become so uncertain a crop here, that I think on the whole that sugar will be best, my great objection to the cotton is the immense outlay to prepare for the making it. My great hope & expectation is, (as it has already been partly accomplished) that this colonigative society, by its buying up this slave coast in Africa & the influence that it will naturally wield, will in a great measure, if not entirely abolish the carrying if african negroes to South America, Cuba & other west India islands, when that is completed, Louisiana sugar will pay well, without our government coming to our aid, by laying a high tariff on imported sugars.

I have never heard from you whether you received the money remitted to you by my murcht , for the payment of the girl bought for Sarah, although I presume you have, in whose name was the title taken? if in Lasah , is there no danger in her being taken for old debts? I ask, as I do not know any thing on Tenn Tennessee . laws. How is Brother doing? is he making a respectable support? is he industrious? and will he ever be able to get along. This is all confidential. I have a great desire to see Sarah comfortable, & will do what I can to attain that end, and feel confident that she will do her part, but I am afraid that B. is too inert, and has too little energy. I am urging Imus to forward Sarah's negroes to her, & have recently given him a good scolding about his negligence, and hope he will attend to it this spring Where may we look for Tom Butler, I have not heard a word from him for a long time. The Bishman ready to pay him, when he has his wife's signature to the sale of the land. so they say. Cant you & cousin P. come down this spring, nothing would please us so much. I calculate to go north next summer if nothing occurs to prevent me, I should go on one of the steam pockets to New York , and can not now say whether I should return by Tennessee . or not The sole object of my visit is to reinstate my constitution that is more or less impaired by exposure , and remaining a long time in a southern climate, & absenting myself one season from my business will accomplish it, at any rate to a certain extent. My intuition is to travel & not spend any time at any particular place
