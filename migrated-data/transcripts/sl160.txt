Cincinnati June 19th 1846 My dear friend I beg leave to inform you of my arrival at this place, and that I am somewhat better than I was when we parted at Smithland . Still finding myself rather feeble, I have concluded to go to the Virginia Springs & to pass a week or two there before I proceed on to New York The following morning after you left, I got on board the SSW Cincinnati, for Louisville — We overtook the Peytonn about 100 miles below Louisville with her other shaft broken, & took her in tow. Besides the shafts, the engine of the Peytonn is much injured — The repairs which the boat will require, will I am told cost at least $7,000— Capt Captain Shallcross appeared very much dejected at his misfortunes & estimates his loss of time in consequence of them as very serious. Remember me most kindly to your lady, & to your good Uncles. I regret exceedingly that I was deprived by indisposition of the pleasure of seeing them at Nashville — I think, however, on account of my health, that I acted prudently in not going up the Cumberland . I hope you found your wife & little boy in good health. Believe me to be with sincere regard Your friend Thos Thomas Layton Mr James A Woods Nashville
