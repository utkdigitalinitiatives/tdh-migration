Nashville April 30th 1850 Dear Mary I went up from the river to the "Telegraph Office" Yester day morning to notify Mr Barksdale that Yourself and "Lou", were underway but alas the Wires Were under the Water, and it was no go — So I consoled myself with the reflection that You would reach Clarksville at least an hour before sundown and that Mr Martin , the clerk, would see you safely to Your quarters, where I trust You are in the full enjoyment of health and spirits Did You blow up the "life preservers" and have them ready for an accident — Your Ma; said that they would not be of any service at least to You— that You would not jump into the water with one on; on any account Dont be afraid — should necessity require it — You will be perfectly safe with Your preserverer preserver to get into the Water any where — I did not rest well last night, being very lonesome — and was up very early this morning, and off to market to deal in Beef, poultry, butter and eggs — We are well — I found out the Strangers now in our city — who we saw at Cincinnati —

I attend old Mr Bateman s funeral this evening — he died Yesterday about twelve oclock — Dr Edgar preached his funeral by request of the old man, before his death — We have nothing new in the city — Tomorrow — "if clear" — will be a gay day — as well as May-Day — I expect to be out with the Temperance badge — to assist in dedicating a "Temple" — Tell Lou we shall look for her and You on Next Saturday — Mr Bourne has not as Yet reached home — When he comes I shall be about ready to gett get off — but it May be not until the 10th or 12th— Here is the Conundrum that took the "album" last night "Why is the Cumberland river in its high Condition, like the California Gold; Because it has a much Wider Circulation than when Confined within its banks"— Ask Mr Barksdale what he thinks of it — I dont Know that I shall write to You again — unless some extraordinary occurrence should take place — I think it is hard that You should be absent the last ten days that I contemplate being at home for several months — However if it affords You pleasure in the trip I am Content —
