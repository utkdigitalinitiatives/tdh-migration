Dearest Mary As there are but few who shed much ink in token of their regards for one so lovely— the task devolves again upon one, who has devoted much time, ink and paper, in that way— I am at this moment called to visit an old lady at Franklin who cannot possibly come to Nashville , and who is with cancer and asthma, the writer William S. Campbell , urges me to come soon, and says she is abundantly able to pay all charges for my trouble and &c et cetera I think it probable that I may go sometime this week— Should I do so— I wish to make the trip in a single day, and will endeavor to do so— When you go out to Morts, tell Em if there is anything she wishes me to buy for her in market to let me know and I will endeavor to procure it for her with the best of my ability— Thou who art ever present upon the tablets of my memory, and seated in the arm chair of my affections— once more adieu Your loving husband George April 5/48
