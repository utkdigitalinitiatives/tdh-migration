City of Washington Feby February 9th 1824 Dear Sir Your letter of the 22nd ultimo which is last and afforded me much pleasure. The account you give me of my overseer, & the progress of my farm & Domestec Domestic concerns is gratifying — I feel gratefull grateful to my young female friends for their attention to Mrs. J Jackson . that her spirits should be kept up is all together important to her heart; and nothing as likely to obtain this, as the company of her young female friends. The view you have taken of our relations with Europe ; and the entention intention of the combination of the Holy alience alliance , one well founded. I have no confidence in England ; nothing but her interest will induce her to take a stand against the combination of Europe, but this may; her ⁁ own situation is not without its perils; Russia has been endeavouring to shut her harbors from her Dominion, South America has opened to her view a profitable commence, & a markett market for her many fortunes, this may induce England to act in behalf of South America, and her interest will induce her; If ⁁ it does; with the stand the U United States has, & will take, the —

despots of Europe will pour before they attempt to interfere with South America. The presidential question begin to agitate the minds of the people much; the attempt of a small minority of the members of Congress to get up a caucus & form public opinion to take up a particular candidate will still agitate it more; & I trust will eventuate in prostrating the caucus system all together; should the people suffer themselves to be dictated to by designcy demagogues, who carry on anything by intrigue, & management they cannot expect to see their present happy government perpetrated; it must sink under the scenes of corruption that will be procured under such a system; and in time open bribery may , & I have no doubt will be resorted to, to obtain a seat in the Presidential chair, if the people do not assume their rights of choosing a President themselves. In this contest I take no part; I have long since prepared my mind to say with heart felt submission , may the lords will be done; If it is intended by providence that I should fill the Presidential chair. I will submit to it with all humility, & endeavour to labour labor four years with an eye single to the public good, employing the guidance of providence in all things; but be assured, it will be an event that I never wished, nor expected. My only ambition was

to spend the remainder of my days in domestic retirement, with my little family; it has turned out otherwise to very great annoyance; still I submit with proper resignation. I thank you for your kind attention to Mrs. J. be good enough to continue your attention to her, present me respectfully to your good lady, Emily & little family & believe me your friend, Andrew Jackson Capt J. Captain John Donelson Sir P.S. Post Script present me to my Mrs. J. Mrs. Jackson say I wrote her two days ago.
