Washington Dear Sir Enclosed you will receive a Bounty land Patent of the Heirs of Samuel White decd deceased on Military Land Warrant W ½ of Section 32. Township 47 of Range 28 in the Distric t subject to sale at Clinton Missouri Please acknowledge the immediately. Your other Papers to Mr Edwards have been re of the result of which you will be informed immediately on th to me — You will perceive by the Newspapers that I voted on the last Ballot for Thomas J Campbell . Whig of Tennessee and elected him clerk. I do not know how this may suit the views of my Democratic friends in Tennessee but my action was predicated on the clearest and most satisfying view of my duty and upon this I must stand or fall — Mr Forney of Penn Pennsylvania was the the Democratic Candidate for clerk. I voted for him two weeks and during twenty ballottings balloting continuously. on the day before Mr Campbells election several Northern Democrats deserted Mr Forney and left him only 96 votes and it was evident that his chance of election was utterly hopeless. yet he would not withdraw and there was danger that the Whigs and Free Soilers would unite and elect a Free Soiler as they had already tried to do in the person of Solomon Forte — Under these circumstances the House being disorganized the business of the Country stopped. every thing deranged and no prospect of any Democrat being elected

Mr Campbell being T ennessee Whig and a good Southern man. his office being a trial one involving in his election no principle of our Party. I thought due to the Country and the People I represent that my vote cast the election. Upon consultation with several with of my Democratic Colleagues from Tennessee they thought it right for me to vote for Campbell and it was done I trust my old friends will appreciate my motives Yrs &c Yours etcetera Andrew Ewing
