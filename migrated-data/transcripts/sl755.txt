Murfreesboro 5th April 1819 Gentlemen, I was duly honored with the receipt of your letter, touching your appointment from the president of the United States authorizing you with Col Colonel Cannon to hold a treaty with the Chickasaw Nation of Indians, for the purpose of obtaining a assign of their claim to a salt spring referred to in the 4th article of the late treaty held by Jackson & Shelby with said tribe of Indians. I acknowledge that the Legislature of the United States have acted very generously in transferring their right in this spring, to the State of Tennessee , and I also admit the justice of charging this State with the necessary expenditures: But I have to regret being compelled to assure you that there are no funds at my disposal by which to enable you to affect this very desirable object. It is therefore obvious that no public resources can be placed at your command until the

sitting of the next Legislature, when, I flatter myself, no difficultly will arise in obtaining an appropriation commensurate with all the necessary demands.__ I have the honor to be Your Obt. Servt Obedient Servant . Jos Joseph . McMinn John Overton Robert Weakley Esquire
