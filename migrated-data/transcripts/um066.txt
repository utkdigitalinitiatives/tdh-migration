Columbia Female Institute January 7th 1841 My dear dear Mama I would have answered your very kind ⁁ letter sooner but I thought that Papa would give you all the news. As I want to receive a letter very much indeed from home. I will will write so that you will have to answer it. You cannot imagine how much pleasure it gave me to see my Papa; he told me so much about you all. I made him tell me what how all the children were employed when he left home and all about Aunt N's Narcissa's sickness. O Oh ! Mother I disliked for him to leave me so much. he promised me that he would visit me again in March. I do sincerely hop hope that he will remain with me longer. I sent by Miss Littlefield to Nashville for my Dress in Box but there was none there but w h at cost 20 or 30$ and certainly she did not purchase it. She got me a little trunk which will answer my purpose just as well. Mama Mr Smith has requested all of us girls to

subscribe to the Organ. he says that 2, 3, 4, or 5 dollar will be sufficient for each one. He told us about it four or five weeks ago but I forgot to mention it to Papa until now, for my mind has been so much occupied with other things. Tell Papa as much as he is willing for me to subscribe please to send it in any next letter & I will give it to him. Dear Mama this day two week is the examination. O Oh !

There is one consolation no person will know who the compositions belongs to. I wish that Papa or some one of my relations would come up to it. If it was not for my French. I would have more time to study my other Studies. My Music Teacher has not concluded what peice piece I shall play at the Examination. I want to take under some other teacher next session for I do not think that Mrs Boardman does me justice, as I told Papa. We are engaged all day Sundy Sunday (except when we are at Church) in reciting our Moral Philosophy and Some Prayers, out of the Prayer Book. I entend intend to study all next Saturday. O Oh ! that was such a pretty Book that Papa sent me; it gave me so much pleasure to receive it. Yesterday you know it rained rained very hard. When Uncle Jim came from the Post Office with the letters all the girls crowed crowded around him to see who had one. his hat being very wet. one of the girls out of mischief knocked off his hat. When he gave Mr Smith the letters he told Mr S Smith — that one of the girls had knocked his hat off. and he asked him why did
