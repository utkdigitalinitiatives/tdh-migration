The Old man Is supposed to be a Spaniard but calls himself a Catawba Indian. His wife children are Negroes John Smith his X mark Test Testimony E Jones

We the undersigned certify that a man named Hosea Morgan Having the appearance of a Spaniard but representing himself to be a Catawba Indian having spent many years among the Spaniards and having with him a Negro family, came into this District six or seven years ago or there abouts. On his first arrival he applied to the Council for permission to reside in the Nation as a Citizen but was refused About two years ago Mr. Smith obtained a permit for him to attend my his mill. But he has never made any pretentions pretensions to have any right or title to land or Citizenship in the Nation till he was received as an emigrant to the Arkansas. Now we respectfully but earnestly protest against, persons having no Cherokee blood and possessing no sort of title in our country being allowed to alienate portions of the land in this way which we conceive to be utterly unlawful for our own acknowledged citizens to do. Signed on behalf of a full meeting of the Citizens of the Dist. District Test. Testimony Situagi his X mark Sweetwater his X mark Peter his X mark
