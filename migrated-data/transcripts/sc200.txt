Washington College Oct October . 16, 1848 Dear Sir, After remaining here nearly a week your son William left and is I presume doubtless at home before this: I employed all the arguments I could command to induce him to remain and regret much that he has left us. My own impression is that under the circumstances he will not attend to his studies any more and I would suggest that some active occupation would be more likely to engage his attention than study. I paid his tuition to the Treasurer of the Board before I knew of his intention to leave whether they will refund or not I do not know as it is against their rules. As the Board pay me a stated salary I can have no control in this matter. The servant I had engaged proved to be utterly worthless and and as Francis is well pleased at Mr Stuart's I think of letting him remain here at least for the present. If the servant you made mention of as being for sale could be hired I would like to hire but I am not able to buy. Francis is desirous of private instruction in addition to the regular College course. I am willing to give him private instruction but it would cost him much more as it would require the same amount of labour as to teach a class of ten_ The ordinary price of private in instruction is fifty dollars per session_ I could not charge less than thirty If you prefer his taking the common course you will please inform

me. The course he wishes to pursue would I have no doubt be far more improving to him. I hope William will change his mind and come back in a few weeks. Our school is still growing and I think will be a good one in the course of the session Please present my highest regards to Mrs. Alexander. Yours truly A. Alexander Doak
