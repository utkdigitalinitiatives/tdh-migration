Murfreesboro October 26th 1825 To his Excellency the Governor of Tennessee Sir, In obedience to the instructions given us by you for taking the latitude of Walker's line between this State and Kentucky , & also of that recently run by Colonel Steel of Kentucky in this state: We now have the honour honor to report that, on the nineteenth of this month we commenced the business assigned us, and found the latitude of the line run by Colonel Steel at a point near Springfield to be 36 degrees 28 minutes and 44 seconds. We then proceeded to Walker's line and found the latitude of the same of the point where it is crossed by the road leading from Springfield in this State to Russelville in Kentucky to be 36 degrees 37 minutes 9 seconds. From this it appears that the line run by Colonel Steel is south of latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes one statute mile

and a half: and that Walker's line is north of latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes eight statute miles: making the distance between the two lines at or near the points where the latitude was taken nine and a half statute miles very nearly. From the very favourable favorable circumstances under which the observations were made, we feel warranted in the belief that the above statement is correct Respectfully submitted William L,, Williford George W. McGehee
