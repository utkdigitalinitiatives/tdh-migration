Columbia Female Institute November 7th 1840 My dear Mother I received your kind and affectionate letter on last Thursday. I had began to think that you did not intend writing at all to me for it was so long a time before you did write— but I can forgive you for that, for when it did come it contained so much good advice to me, that I read it and all of the rest of my letters over eve⁁ r y night. (for I have not time to read them in the day time.) Dear Mam ⁁ m a you requested me to read my Bible; I do read it every morning of my life. I hope that you will forgive me for not writing home last week: but I thought as I had written two letters home week before last that you would not be uneasy. I just got time last week to answer cousin Rachel's letter. Please tell Eliza Bigelow , and Frank Patterson to write to me, not to wait for me to write to them for I have hardly time to write to you. Mam ⁁ m a although you wrote me that Aunt Narcissa's sickness was not serious, I cannot help from feeling uneasy. Tell her that I shall feel uneasy until I receive a letter from her I want her to fill the three pages. Tell Uncle

and cousin Will they do not know how much a letter from them would gratify me. I am almost tired of asking Aunt P, cousin Jane, and cousin Martha Ann to write me. I cannot let brother John, and sister, off with one letter, they must write to me again. I am expecting Papa up to see me every day. Mam ⁁ m a Please send me up some hazel nuts by Papa if he can bring them with conenience convenience . I expect that you will think it a very strange request, but I have not had any thing good since I ⁁ have been here. You wanted to know what I was studying and how I stood in my classes. It's of now no use for me to write you as I expect Father has received my record by this time. We had a dreadful hail storm last evening—⁁ Some of the hail was nearly as large as a hen eggs, four or five pane's of glass was broken at the Institute. Sixteen panes were broken out of Aunt Walkers house, there was a great deal of lightning with it. We were all very much frightened I can assure you. I was thinking about you all at home all of the time. How many teeth has brother Sam got now. I expect that he can walk and talk I dont want him to forget me. learn him teach how to call my name. Do not let any of the children forget me. Has Mary Ormand forgotten me. I have been away from home for so long a time O! it seems to me that it has been a year. If I could receive a letter oftener more often I could pass my time more pleasantly. Dear Mam ⁁ m a Give my love to my Papa & all of my Brothers and my sister, and to all of my Aunts and cousins and Uncles

Post Script Please excuse my bad writing and spel⁁ l ing for I just wrote on a book in my lap in a very great hurry I can assure. Give my love to all of the servants
