Columbia F Female Institute December [8th], 1840 My dear Mama Your long expected letter arrived here on Monday to very welcome hands I can assure you. O Oh ! I was so very happy to receive one from you and to hear how you honoured honored my Birth Day . I would rather that you had honoured honored it in that way than any other. I hope that you will write to me often now. I am so much pleased to hear that you intend writing more regularly nowt now . mind I shall expect you to keep that promise. M. J. Mary Jane Chester P.S. Post Script Do you realy really think that I have improved in my letter writing. I am afraid that you will not think so in this one for I have scarcely any time to write in. Tell me what did you think of the first letter I wrote to you. It was about Dusk

when Mr Brinkley sent word to me that he would carry it for me. You know that I was very weak then. Well I sat down to try to write. I could think of nothing at all to write. I would have given any thing in this world to have had you by me then to show me how. but I had no person. I thought that there was nothing like the little word trying. You know that I had never written a letter in my life without you telling me every word to write. I folded and backed it. Cousin Jane I suppose wanted it to look very nice as she had to cary carry it. So it was she looks it open and backed it again. I wish that you would burn it up. I know that you did let any one see it. I beleive believe that I have given you the History of my first letter. It was as difficult for me to write the second one. You have no idea how very difficult it is for me to get my things down town. I have not got near all of my Winter Clothing yet, because it so inconvenient to the Walkers & Mr Smith will not permit us to go down town ourselves. So I think that it would be better for me to purchase my things from Mr Smith. He has said that the girls shall not get more than 50$ worth on any account whatever. I will get nothing more than is absolutely ness ⁁ cary necessary . He says that rather than the girls should get me he would give them things. I am assure her that I would not accept of any of his presents. My dear Mother I do not think that you need be

be uneasy abut about my sleeping in the 3rd Story as Mr S Smith has had all the Chimneys burnt o ⁁ u t. I do not think that there is any danger now. I beleive believe he has no idea of changing my Sleeping Room. O Oh ! I am so glad to hear that Miss Rebecca Moles has got married at last. I think as you say she has a very good beginning for a young Lady. Tell Sister and Brother John that I am looking very anxiously for their letters. Does not Brother R. write well eneough enough to write to me. I think that he might answer my letter. I wrote Cousin Jane Rawlings a letter the other day I hope that she will answer it soon I received a letter from Cousin Dick the other day saying that Aunt Narcissa had another of the over lasting Chills. I wish that I was there to help nurse her. O Oh ! I am so very sorry to hear that she is sick again. I'll I will tell what I think will cure her (or at least it cured me) On my chill days Cousin Elen made me lie in bed all Day take Quinine every half hour and a Wine Glass of Toddy every half hour. I did not want to take so much but they made me. Its true that It made my head very dizzy. but that was nothing compared with being well. Do tell her to try it. perhaps it will do her some good. Tell her that she must come up Christmas any how. I wish you would tell Aunt Butter that she must excuse me for writing that very short letter to her on Aunt N. paper . She must answer it soon. I was very much astonished to hear that Aunt Frances had gone to Shelby . I did not expect that she would go down this winter. did she leave any of her children at our house. Give my love to Papa and my Sister & Brothers
