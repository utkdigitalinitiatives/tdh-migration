Camp Ringold Near Matamoos 22nd November 1846 The Tennessee Regiment of Cavalry have crossed the Rio Grande, and encamped upon the Mexican side, and is now the strongest Regiment in the whole army of the United States— Strongest in numbers, and in the vigorous health. And tho' though there have been very many cases of sickness in ⁁ the Regiment upon their march yet there have been remarkably and wonderfully few deaths— This is very much to be attributed to the vigilance, and skill of the acting surgeon of Regt. Regiment Dr. Robards ⁁ who has prescribed during the time of his acting as Surgeon for almost every man For his devoted attention to the sick of the Regiment ⁁ upon their arduous and tedious march thro' Ark. & through Arkansas and Texas. he is entitled to the gratitude of us all and of our friends, — He has been supplanted as Regimental Surgeon by the appointment of Dr. Allsuss'— But Dr. Robard is a volunteer and has generously volunteered ⁁ a continuation of his⁁ valuable services to the Regiment without compensation— And so numerous have been the applications to the Col. Colonel Couidt to furnish Dr. Robards with medicines that this evening the Col. Colonel has promised the officers applying, to furnish the Doctor with authority to procure medicines— If he does not receive the pecuniary compensation and the compensation of rank in the army ⁁ which he so well deserves let him at least receive the reward he deserves in the of public gratitude.
