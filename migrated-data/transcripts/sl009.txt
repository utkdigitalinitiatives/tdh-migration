Nashville , November 22d 1821 Sir, I have the honor to enclose for your information, a letter of the 29th of August last from Mr Peniurs with his memois memoirs on the Floridas. Being much pressed with business at this time, I have been compelled to refer Mr Peniurs to the Secretary of E. East Florida (W Worthington) for the information he has desired. Mr Worthington has a copy of my talk with the Indians, and has been particularly instructed upon most of the points upon which Mr Peniurs wishes to be informed. He will therefore be able fully to explain to him the course which I have thought ought to be pursued towards the Indians within the Floridas.— A copy of this talk I also transmitted to you in my letter of Septer September 20th last. Mr Peniurs has desired permission to present his accounts for settlement to the Secretary of East Florida— this I could not permit, in as much as I have forwarded my
