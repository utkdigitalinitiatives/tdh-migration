On the Day Major Curry was at Ross's old place I was there drinking. David Ross adver wanted to buy my place and offered $25 for it I refused. Jas McGrey took me aside rather privately and offered the same and wished me to let him have it I refused him also- Then Ross and McGrey endeavored to persuade me to enroll but I refused This is the last I remember for I went to sleep. afterwards a white man who was present told me that they wakened me up and took me to the agent and tryed tried to make me take hold of the pen to mark but did not do it, but they put my name down. Next day when I recovered from a state of inebriety and was told I had enrolled I thought they were in jest. In three or four days I was told that they held me bound as an emigrant. and some white people are now claiming my place and threatening to turn me out of doors having bought the good will of James McGrey Signed this 9th April 1834 Edward Walsh his x mark Test.
