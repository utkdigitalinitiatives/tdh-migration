Executive Department Nashville April 22d 1845 To the Sheriff of Washington County Tennessee Sir Enclosed you will find a warrant for the apprehension of William MS Bales Nathaniel L Brown John S Block and Arless C Collins charges with the crime of highway robery robbery in the state of North Carolina . These individuals have been regularly remanded acording according to the requirements of the Correction and Laws. I am aware that there is much feeling and excitement in your County growing out of the case but I trust that the Law and Constitution will be regarded as paramount of the guilt or inocene innocence of these individuals I know nothing they may be inocent innocent but this is not a question that I or you or any other authority in this state is competent to decide. The simple question for my consideration is have they been charged with an offense against the Laws of North Carolina and is the evidence of this fact made to me according to law if so I have no alternative and it is equally the duty of all the arch officers of this state to do their duty You know your duty and I doubt not will perform it Yours Respectfully James C Jones
