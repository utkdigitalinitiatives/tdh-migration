Columbia Tennessee Feby February 1st 1841 My dear Papa Your kind letter of the 24th Ult. Ultimo arrived here yesterday. It was very kind in your sending me that money. I gave it to Mr. Smith , he seemed very much pleased and said that it was a very liberal subscription. I told him that $1 ½ was for the Paper. The examination is just over. It continued three days there there were not many people the first day ⁁ on account of the weather but the ⁁ third day the house was crowded. I missed but one question the whole time, and I do not think that I should have missed that one had I not been so much frightened. Mr Walkers family came every day. Cousin Sam said that he intended to write to you immediately after it was over. So I expect that you will receive his letter before you do mine. The Rev Reverend Mr Wheat of Nashville was here: and read out the Composition. Father you requested me in your last letter not to write so many letters. I will discontinue all my letters to every person with the exception of our family. I was very much distressed when I read that part of your letter. I did not think that I had ever written any thing that I would not be willing for any person

to read. I am very glad that you have told not to write. I will do any thing that I think would please you and Mama I know the reason that you did not speak of it when you were here. You did not like to speak of any thing that you thought would give me pain. I do not think that I can graduate this Summer. I wish that you would write to Mr. Smith about it. O Oh ! I should like to graduate so much. I study as hard as it is possible for any one to study. Next session I will try and get the Premium in dilligence diligence , but I should like for that to remain a secret. I have not time to write a longer letter. Give my love to Aunt P. Patsey & Aunt N Narcissa , and all my relations kiss my Sister and brothers and Mama. I remain your ever affectionate Daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester Col Robt Colonel Robert J Chester P. S.
