Paris Tenn Tennessee June 15 — 49 Mit — Your kind favor I have just perused I dont do not think a letter ever came in a better time. It served so well to cheer the drooping spirits of a convulecent convalescent man. It was the first letter I had taken out of the P.O. Post Office in person for two weeks nearly. I have been mighty sick for a few days. But I feel thankful that I am up & able to visit & go about the streets when necessary, again. I was fearful that Pa & Ma would grow uneasy about me from the contents of Sis Sister Susan letter which I wrote when I had just begun to mend a little hence I wrote to them by the last mail in course, but it fail to go out hence I shall not send the letter. I have not much to tell you about "storms & company & courting". For I give it up, that you can beat me on exciting topics or that, rather you can write with more life. I could tell you about sickness & disease, melancholly melancholy feelings & lonely moments, but I am recovering from all of these fearful ills I trust. Just about now I think that it would take some extra occassion occasion to drive dullness away from Paris, by the way we are to have a temperance celebration, speech, procession &c et cetera here tomorrow. I have not determined whether I shall attend. I gazed over town this evening & I thought that it looked more lovely than usual, we have in the centre center s of our " burg" more pretty shade trees than I ever saw in any little town, which adds much to the comfort of loungers &c et cetera My hand seems to be out this evening — perhaps I should indulge a more serious strain. But I confess myself frequently at a loss what to say next, as I write just as the words & ideas f low which is very slow
