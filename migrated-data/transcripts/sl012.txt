Hermitage Febry February 28th 1845 — private — Major Wm William B Lewis , My dear Major, Your interesting letter of the 17th instant is received, advising that mine of the 4th. & 5th. had reached you — Before this reached you Col Colonel Polks Cabinett Cabinet will be known, and I am sure there will no one compose it unless under the terms I framed to you — should there be, then Col Colonel Polk must have changed his mind after he left me.

Common sense will at once shew show the evil consequences that struck to Col Colonel Polk, to put himself in the attitude of providing Mr Tyler for the succession — It would split the democracy to pieces, and redouned to the great injury of Polks administration — I love from the moment I heard it put my face against it, & hope I have checked this inconsiderable movement — I hope there is not truth in the rumor— if there is, there is less common sense in the movers than I calculated upon, let me hear from you. Your sister, Mrs. Leister , & one of her daughters spent day before yesterday with me— They all carry good health — All my Household join me in the kindest salutation, yr your friend. Andrew Jackson P.S. Post Script My shortness of breath increases — I am greatly affected — A.J. Andrew Jackson
