Columbia Tenn Tennessee Decr December 22 1843 Govr Governor Jones, My dear Sir, Will you pardon me for attending upon your notice, the fact, (unless I am misinformed) that no provision is made by Legislative enactment in this state, for the maintenance & instruction of the blind. Surely they are a class of unfortunates that most justly claim our sympathy & properly may demand protection & support at the hands of an enlightened government. It would be alike creditable to your administration and to the Legislature of the state which ranks as fifth in the union in population, & which falls behind none in sentiments of honor and justice that some provision be made for this purpose. If an institution cannot be established within the state for the blind, at least an appropriation might be authorized from the Treasury, to aid this unfortunate class in availing themselves of the benefits & privileges of such institutions in neighboring states__ In the multiplicity of cases which claim the attention of the statesman, it is not surprising if such a subject as this, should be overlooked. I have deemed it only necessary to present it to your notice, feeling confident that you will judge wisely whether to make any suggestion or not

to the Legislature now in session. Although I address you under your official title I wish this communication to be considered as entirely private & confidential. If you do not deem it a suggestion worthy of notice, commit this to the flames and say nothing about it. I remain dear Sir very truly & sincerely yr your friend Jas H. Oley
