Nashville 24 June 1837 Br Brother Ewing I duly received your very brief note enclosing $5.00. I wrote you two or three times last winter and no reply. once from Leighton Alabama You have learned by this time the action of the Assembly in relation to the College and paper. The first I believe will do well The other I have reason to fear will not be continued. The terms of the continuation you have seen. I do most anxiously desire to see Cumberland Presbyterian in possession of a good paper but am nearly hopeless on the subject. as I hardly expect the brethren to return their pledges and it has come to such a pass with me now that, without being put in possession of what is owing to me however willing I cannot go on. Judge yourself of my condition from the fact that my printing office alone cost about Twelve thousand Dollars the Cumberland Presbyterian Debts amount to about to $13,000 I have on hands books and due for now sold about $6,000

all of which is unavailable, the banks have stoped stopped business, and every man to whom I owe crying give, give, give added to this I have been printing the Union (government paper) and a methodist paper, for which the Editors owe me nearly a thousand Dollars & I cannot get it From this parts and the circumstance that when I commenced business my whole capital was only about $1,500. I leave you to judge what my perplexities must be. Did the Church by a rigorous exertion collect and pay me one half what is owing me by her members I could come out triumphantly, but on this subject there is little hope and being convinced that the longer I go on as I have done the worse it will be I shall have to stop. I think I can sell out my printing office so as to pay what I owe and then the world is before me though it is a hard matter to take for the benefit of brethren for years and then be ruined by them and have to begin anew with a large and very

hepless helpless family. But I thank God I have some fortitude and if for my sins I have to be trampled in the dust I hope I shall have grace to bear it. On the other hand if the brethren will exert themselves I will go on that is if they collect enough to make me so to do. I had made out all my accounts for western Missouri clergymen to send them to you to have them distributed among the brethren but hate to trouble you and therefore decline for the present. The truth is I dont know what to do O that God would direct me yours in best ends Jas James Smith you know Raines published a C P Cumberland Presbyterian paper at Pittsburgh , it is dead and he has disgraced himself & his church JS James Smith
