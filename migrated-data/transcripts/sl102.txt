Nashville , Nov. November 1826 My dear Mother It was my intention to have written by last mail but I forgot that Tuesday was mail day 'till it was too late to write, and I regret it as I had good news to communicate. Mr. Campbell will preach in Charlotte the first Sunday in December, and I hope it will be convenient not only for you and my Father to attend, but also the little ⁁ girls and William , if he is not much altered, will be delighted, to attend, preaching, and I am very desirous he should hear Mr. Campbell , that the want of new clothes may not be one apology for his not attending, I send him a new suit by Mrs. Gould had it not been for this preaching I would not have given them to him 'till Christmas and made them up myself. at present I have no measure to cut by, I hope it will be convenient for you to make them but if not employ Mrs. Stokes , and I will pay her for them.

Last Sabbath was a Sacremental Sacramental Sabbath in the Presbyterian church, and we had a very agreeable meeting, how sincerely did I wish that you had been here to enjoy it. Mr. Farrar was here, and Charles informed me that he had seen my Father last week, Fredonia Marable spent a day in town last week, and came to see me, the Doctor was also in town, but when Fredonia was here, he was at Gen. General Jacksons at a great dinner, which was given to the members of the Legislature. I am always delighted to see any of my friends from Dickson or Montgomery , and I regret very much it has not been in my power to spend more of my time with Mrs. Gould since she has been in town, I intend to spend tomorrow with her.

I regretted it very much, particularly on my little Parsons account, whom I know will feel much disappointed about his clothes but at all events take him to hear

Mr Campbell — he informed me yesterday that he would administer the Sacrement Sacrament in Charlotte when he preached there, I wish very much he was not going 'till Christmas, but I cannot think of leaving here till after our examination, and also at the Academy so that I shall not in all probability reach home till the 24th Decr— December I have not heard from brother John since I wrote to you, nor can I account for his silence I spent last Saturday with Mrs Peyton Robertson , she desired me to present her love to you and the little girls. My whole time is devoted to the School and the parties I attend are prayer meetings and my escorts are Mr. & Mrs. Campbell , who polite as to call for me. Mr. Wade has returned from the Western District , the reason why he did not call at your house was because he had a large party with him. Excuse the brevity of this epistle but I have not time to write any more at present. Please present my love to all the family and believe me Your affectionate Daughter Jane
