I am afraid Mother will not be able to get down if she stays up here much longer. College commenced last Monday and I have been regularly installed in College, also into the Society. I found it quite hard to commen ce Study, but soon get used to it. We have about 21 new students, most of them from the south, and some of them even from Baltimore . We went up to Madison a few days ago, and bought us Candles, and a few other things. We have also engaged 5 cords of wood.
