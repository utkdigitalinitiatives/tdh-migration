No number 20 Steamer Col. Colonel Cross' — Rio Grande — Octr. October 31st. 1846. My Dear Wife My last letter was from Monterey, in which I gave you kind of journal up to the 22nd— I met with no adventure upon my return to Carmango worth relating— I caught a bad cold either by getting my feet wet in a branch one night, on my return, or else by sleeping out in the Chaparral without a tent, which I did on two nights on my return, being the first time I have passed a night during the campaign without a shelter— The next morning after I returned to Carmango I went across the river to Gen. General Lamars, camp to hunt for your Uncle Frank , (whom I met on my way to Monterey, as I wrote you ⁁ in my last) and to my great disappointment, I found he had left the camp the night before and had gone with the main body of his company about 10 miles distant upon his way to Loredo —I wrote a note which I sent & which would overtake him before he should get any further, urging him to come back at once to my quarters in Carmango, but I had not heard from him when I left— I have met on board this boat, the 1st kinsman of my fathers' whom I have ever seen, a cousin of my father—his name is Gatlin, a brother of the Dr. Gatlin who was killed at Leade's battle ground in Florida — this gentlemen is a Captain in the U.S. United States Army— promoted from a Lieutenancy, for his gallantry in the battles of Resaca & Palo Alto — he has been wounded in the battle of Monterey, (in the arm)— and is on his way to the U.S. United States for the benefit of his general health which is not good— I think he is very much of a gentleman—

I heard yesturday yesterday morning that our Regiment was on their way to Matamaroo & would probably reach these in a few days. I immediately tendered my resignation as Aid De Camp— and recd. received orders from Gen. General Patterson, to take command of a detachment of our Regiment who had arrived at Carmango two days before⁁ as invalids— and proceed with them on board this steamer—the steam was up when I recd. received my orders— I was on board in an hour— and shall soon be with my company again. I regret very much to hear that James Brazelton has behaved very badly (very dissipated) and that he has been discharged. I thought I was very badly hurt this morning— I went to take a bath in the wheel house of the S. Boat— the wheel was turning slowly, and I got as close to the wheel as I could, so that it might throw the water upon me— the steam was let on suddenly & the wheel threw the water with such force I sprang farther off — my foot slipped & I fell upon the open slats and cut a gash above my left ear which bled very profusely— but as soon as the bleeding ceased I dressed and ate a hearty breakfast. I feel no other inconvenience from it, except such I have often felt from a bruise, I will continue to write to you frequently, but my dear wife I have despaired of receiving your letters by mail— tho though my anxiety is very great— to know how you are— how Eliza is— & how the little boy is— I know I ought to be with my family— & for one out of many other reasons that Eliza might be at school—

I have generally lived very economically & saving and have had hopes of saving something very clever but my trip to Monterey⁁ including purchases of mule & mustang & this journey to join the regiment, will make a considerable addition to the hole in a moths months pay which is made by necessary expenses— My calculations is that we will remain at or in the neighbourhood neighborhood of Matamoras some two or three weeks, and then that we shall be marched toward Tampico — it must be several months before I can get back home— I had lost some flesh until my trip to Monterey since which time I have been fattening,— & have felt stouter than I have since I left home— Direct your letters to me—as Capt. Captain C Tenn Tennessee calvary— U. S. Army— Mexico — My love to Eliza—& your Ma & Hal— & to our little boy— Yr affection Your affectionate Husband Wm R. William Richard Caswell the tremor of the boat has caused me to write so bad a hand.
