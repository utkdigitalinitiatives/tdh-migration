Russellville Feb February 25th 1850 My Dear Mary On my return this fall, I found so many things pressing on me, that I defered deferred writing till I could adjust matters, unless something compeled compelled me to write & promised myself to make amends after Christmass Christmas . But I have suffered much with pain in my head & eyes since that time, & am now just recovering from an attack until I am almost as bad a correspondent as yourself & your mother, Indeed if it were not for the Capt Captain I should never write to either of you with any certain prospect of hearing from you. But now the time has been so long since we heard, & every now & then I am interogated interrogated about when I heard from you & it is time I should respond — Very recently I wish I had something interesting to write you, but what could I have — This certainly has been the dullest winter for ma n y Presley has been absent , & Mr E & Henry has been a goodeal good deal from home — They are winding up the store at Adairville

James left it — So your mother can see how she is blessed in having all, or nearly all of her children settled around her, & doing well — We are all moving on much as usual — Mr J. B. Bihh & wife talks of going to New Orleans shortly, If the Cholera does not deter them — Mrs. R. Bihh is in usual health this winter — O we have had a wedding this winter, but a very still one, Mrs. ⁁ J Davidson to George Grey — I suppose you would like to hear something from Mrs Mauy — She is living at Mr Skyles His last daughter was married this winter, & they were anxious to have Mrs M Mauy 's society in thier their loneliness — I think I have given you all the news that I am in possession of — Now let me entreat you to do the same — One thing however for the Capt — Our state as he will have seen

is in a perfect Commotion relative to this new constitution, Mr. E. was called out to address the people to day ⁁ against it (being County Court day) & it is thought from the signs of the times that Logan will reject it by a large majority. How the state will go is yet doubtful, but the thing is very odious to many, & the whigs particularly — They laid down thier arms & made a truce with the democrats, & united in this perplexing Slavery question, by which they got a majority of democrats in Convention, & they have made a Constitution as they think for them selves but it suits no body well, for it is perfectly uninteligible that ⁁ is many Clauses, & they differ among themselves as to the constitution But its a model for schools in its grammatical structure, or arrangement, to be handed down to our childrens children as a specimen of our literature — But enough, we are already sick of it, & God firbid forbid the people may not be sicker My paper runs short but permit me to ask the favour favor of you to get the reciept receipt for the rough & ready cake, & enclose it — I lost the one I had — Also ask your mother about the Peas she gave me, what they are good for, How to grow them, & who the four papers were for? Please remember me kindly to all, & particularly to Sally — Are you not coming over soon ? Will not Mary Bostic come with you?
