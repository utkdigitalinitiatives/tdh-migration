You will be surprised at any reasonable man were he to say it was a bad cause yet there are a great many, who are fond of drink, and know that it would be disgraceful for them to indulge, were the temperance reform to gain the ascendency ascendancy , these men say every thing they can against the society Excuse my short letter as I have to go to Charlotte , and were I not to put it in the office to day today , I should not have an opportunity of sending it for some time.
