Nashville 6 Nov November 1847 His Excellency N. Neil S. Brown I take pleasure in stating to you in writing the substance of what I said to you in person before the pardon of McCoy was obtained for he was charged with negro stealing; and tryed and convicted before me_ the slave had before the theft been hired to some one in Memphis his master resided five f or six miles from Town McCoy had several times been at the shop where the slave was at work, where some conversation passed between them in regard to the slaves emancipation, the precise purport of which I cannot now detail__ the third or fourth day after the last meeting between McCoy & the slave as seen at the shop McCoy hired a horse & buggy and drove out some five miles, not so far as White s the owner of the slave_ upon his return three or three & half miles from Memphis the negro; hailed the prisoner_ who drew up his horse the conversation which passed there was not heard by witnesses who were lying in ambush to watching his movements_ as soon as the slave arrived at the buggy he mounted into it_ when McCoy drove off at a fast speed_ these were the material facts proved on trial. Altho Although I refused a new trial, my mind was not however fare far from doubt, as to his possible innocence; If there had been proof of his good character I would have given him a new trial_ he has now been in prison for nearly three years, and upon the whole, if he has proven a good moral character I am of the opinion he ought to be pardoned your friend E. W. M. King
