Readyville , Tenn Tennessee June 26 1837 To the Executive Board Nashville Tenn Gentlemen, Since I had the pleasure of meeting you at Nashville, on 8 inst instant I have rec examined the country from the vicinity of Columbia Eastward towards Shelbyville , 15 miles; several days have been spent about Columbia, in endeavoring to find a practicable route through it; and I have also examined the country as far east as the head of Stone's River , passing near Gideonville , Versailles , Murfreesboro , Readyville and Woodbury A large part of this route has been actually surveyed, and a large scope of country examined The party arrived here yesterday, (Sunday) and are now engaged in making a survey of the ridge between Cripple Cr and Stone's River Mr Nance is behind, engaged in continuing the examination of the route heretofore examined by him from Cherryville by mouth Duck River Franklin &c He in expected here tomorrow. I shall move on tomorrow beyond Woodbury and set the party to running a line up one of the branches of Stone's River, and down Charles Cr. Creek whilst I extend still further my examinations. There is no doubt but that the route must go either down this creek, or on the contiguous ridge if it ever touches the valley of Stones River. It will be impracticable for a Rail Road to cross Caney Fork below the Falls. From some point near the mouth of Charles

Creek, I shall return with the party towards the Forks of Duck River, and survey the route from mouth of Noahs Cr. to intersect the route down Charles Cr. either at the head or near McMinnville I shall myself have to return to the vicinity of Cedar Spring in Maury County , to resume my examination of the southern Route. It will probably be two weeks before I finally leave the vicinity of McMinnville, and it will require three or four weeks more to cross the Mountains. There has been some sickness in the party for a week or two past, owing chiefly to our exposure to the weather, which has been very unfavourable unfavorable . But I anticipate a much better state of health for all the party when we get into the mountain regions. Every member of the party seems to do his duty cheerfully and industriously. Very Respectfully Albert Miller Sea, Ch Engr Chief Engineer State Tenn.
