Tellico Blockhouse April 25th 1796 Sir In my letter to you of the 18th Instant forwarded by Mr Byers I quoted a paragraph of a letter from Governor Blount who as Governor of the S South Western Territory was Superintendant of Indians affairs for the Southern District respecting necessary expenditures in the Indian department to which I have yet recieved received no answer Heretofore when any principal chiefs or other Indians on public business came to this place I was authorized to supply them with provisions whiskey and such articles of cloathing clothing at their services intitled entitled them to, and should such supplies be now with held I fear it would excite in them a suspicion that the late change of Government in this country is connected with a Change of the disposition of the United States towards their nation, which might be attended with the worst consequences.__ Permit me, Sir, again to solicit your attention to this subject and to request the favor of a line by the first opportunity. I am, Sir, with respect your Obedient Servant John McKee Col D Colonel David Henley Agent Dept Department War
