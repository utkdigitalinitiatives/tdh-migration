Kingston Roane Cty E Tenn County East Tennessee May 18th 1834 Dear Brother The present opportunity of addressing you a few lines affords me great pleasure— I understand fr from J. W. Wester that you were in good health, and also that you were still well pleased with that County— Father took a trip to the W District about the first of March he went Judge Mitchell's and found them all in good health he stayed only one day and and continued his journy journey when he arrived at Denmark he found the timber on his land very much abused— There is a railroad in contemplation which will pass from Jackson to the Tennessee River , there have been three routs routes surveyed one passing 7 miles from Denmark one 5 and one passing over one corner of Father's land,— it is thought that it is most probable to pass over Fathers land. But let it pass where it may it will certainly enhance the value of land in that section of Country Father says Denmark is still improving tolerably fast

Fain and expect to stay untill until Geo George S Gillespie returns and opens his goods, I am staying merely to get a little knowledge of the business and I do not know at this time whether or not I will continue at this business this summer or not Father says that if I like the business he will sit me up with a capital of $2,000 at Denmark next Spring. If it Should so happen I shall endeavor to get a partner. But I would certainly be very Cautious in chosing choosing one, for in a case of that kind, a persons welfare depends very much on their partner There is but little news of a general character in this Country The Neighbours Neighbors have generally been well
