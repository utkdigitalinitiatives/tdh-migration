Tulip Grove April 25th 1850 My dear Son Your letter of the 27th Feby February with one to your Sister Mary came in due time. Nothing can be more gratifying to us than to know that you have weathered in safety the exposures of the past winter, and that the period draws nearer and nearer when we may be blessed again with your presence in the family circle I have written to you twice since my return, but fear that you do not receive letters addressed from this point. We are again well arranged in our household matters and by the time you reach us hope to have our house newly papered and painted, so that should you or Mary wish to marry, our friends may meet in cumfort comfort to partake of our happiness.

But I hope there will soon be a reaction and that when you come again things will wear a better aspect, and our society become again distinguished for its support of religion and good order. I am saving a good horse for you and will have ready for you a body servant. Take care of your constitution, and remember that of all the gifts of God that of good health is the most precious. we may struggle against poverty but without health there is no capacity for the acquisition of any of the cumforts of life. I will write you evry every month. Accept the prayers of all the family for your safety and happiness, and our hopes that you may join us again before the year is gone Yr. Your affectionate father A J Andrew Jackson Donelson Lieut. Lieutenant A J Donelson
