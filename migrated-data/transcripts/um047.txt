Bond Co. Ill. County Illinois Aug Sept September 15 1837 Dear sir yours was recd received a few days since I write you at present to comply with your request. I have, the past summer, traveled extensively thro through this state and from observation could tell you much about it. It has been unusually healthy in this state the past season. The most desirable part of the state is that portion which lies between the place Illinois & Mississippi rivers. Called the military military trail. And of that portion, Warren Co. County is the best. It has a rich soil and a salubrious climate chills and fevers are scarcely known except near the large streames streams . It is a well watered region. You will frequently find springs & and permenant streames permanent streams flowing from them thro through the prairies. Water can be had any where by digging at a convenient depth. Monmouth is the Co County seat 12 miles from the river. Okauka , lately laid out on the river, will be a considerable place. Burlington , about 200 miles north of St Louis , on the west side of the river, is a flourishing town I would advise to go to Burlington and make enquiries inquires & explore the country on both sides of the river. It is probably the best portion of North America . Stone-coal is abundant. I was better pleased with Warren than any part of the western country I have seen.

time concluded to go there this fall: But for certain reasons have put it off untill until next spring. The eastern part of the state when you get as far north as 39° 30." is a very sick country, but it is low & unhealthy. A great number of Eastern people are coming into the state. The harvests in the more northern parts of the state were excellent. The corn is very good thro. throughout the state Improvements of all sorts are going on with great rapidity. I am glad you have made a final settlemen settlement of my business. My money $300.00 was paid over to David Reinhardt of Lincolnton on the 8th of Jan January . and I see from your letter that C. E. Reinhardt has not acknowledged it until the 8th of July . I cannot see what right they had to the use of $300.00 of my money for six months. I have heard of the fall of Mr Edmonson of Paris . If you have the paper in which he is published, I would like you to send it to me. In the midst of the sickness and mortality that has prevailed in your town, I am glad your family have escaped. I have been from home for 5 months, with the exception of calling & staying a few days 3 or 4 times. My agency is now nearly out, and I design to spend the winter at home. My respects to your family yours &c and et cetera Jas. Stafford
