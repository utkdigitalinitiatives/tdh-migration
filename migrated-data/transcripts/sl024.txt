Nashville 7 Sept September 1819 Sir I have the honor to acknowlege acknowledge the recpt receipt of yr year letter of the 10th Uti Ultima with its enclosure On the recpt receipt thereof I referred it to the asst assistant Surgion Surgeon general for his report therean therein . Shortly after I was attacked with my old complaint, with unusual violence, that confined me to my bed, and from which I am just recovering, much emancipate & debilitated. yesturday yesterday was the first day, that I could sit so long as to write even a short note, which will account to you for the delay attendant on my aswer answer . I herewith enclose you the asst assistant Surgion Surgeon General's report, from which you will find, that there never did exist such a Division order as Doctor Gale refers to in his report. The order of the 21st August 1816 was long previous to the present organization of the Medical Staff — That of the 18 August 1818 was merely to change the reports required to be made to the Asst. Assistant Generals office, to that of the Asst. Assistant Surgion Surgeon general's of Division These reports were intended for my own information as to the health of the army, and did not, nor were intended to have interference with the orders of the Surgion Surgeon General. From the orders required

to be made of Surgn Surgeon General, I discovered that no report was ordered to be made to me. It was not only my duty, but all important for me to know the state, condition, and health of my troops; and have the Medical Staff performed their duty; that if — neglect existed, a speedy remedy might be applied, for without the health of an army be preserved it cannot be effective; and to have knowlge knowledge of this without lending in the least to interfere with the Surgn Surgeon Generals Department was my alone object Your order directing the arest arrest of Col Colonel King 4th Infantry come duly to hand, & has been promptly attended to, of which you have been advised by my adjt. adjutant General. Genl. General Gaines has communicated to me the recpt receipt of the orders to him, on this subject, & of his prompt attention thereto. Will you permit me to remark that the manner of the arrest of Col. Colonel King is I think without precedent. Permitting subordinate officers, charged with high military offenses, — under arrest, & a court ordered for their trial, to prefer charges against their superior, and to send them to you contrary to possitive positive rule; drawing that represents a footnote & at the same time, the trial of the subordinate to be suspended until after the trial drawing that represents a footnote Art of War. 34 & 1st sent. mil. correpce sentence military correspondence p.55

of the superior is had, is to destroy all subordination in the army. This precedent may be insisted on in cases hereafter, and will produce the worst consiquences consequences , exciting subordinate officers in all like cases to prefer charges against their superiors by way of revenge, & to procrastinate their own fate I have also the honor to acknowlge acknowledge the recpt receipt of your adjt. adjutant & Inspector Genls. Generals letter of the 10th ult ultimo with its enclosures. Before its recpt receipt B Brig Genl Brigadier General Bissel had been detailed on the court for trial of Col. Colonel King. I have ordered him to join his regiment on a dissolution of the court, & duplicate orders are sent to him I expect to be be compelled to prefer charges against Genl. General Ripley , which if I do will be laid before you, for your consideration; when a detail of either a full court from the Northern Division; or a President for the court now detailed for the trial of Col. Colonel King will be necessary, as there is no officer in my division of Genl. General Ripleys grade that can preside.... I can not get a report from him on the subject of the relatory? road, or how the troops are, or have been, employed I am very respectfully yo mo obt sert your most obedient servant Andrew Jackson The Honble Honorable J.C. Calhoun} sec secretary of war}
