Cornplanter Decr. December 6th 1837 My dear Mother, My brother and Mr Bell have informed you of my being in this place. You no doubt think me to blame for taking such a step without consulting you and my father, indeed, no inducement which could have been offered, would have prevailed, had I been ignorant of your sentiments, but knowing you your favorable opinion of Mr Bell I acceded to his proposals not without regret that you had not been formally consulted. A few weeks since, I had not the least idea of coming here before next spring if then, but all my pleas of ill health your consent &c et cetera had no weight with Mr. B. Bell as I told him a sickly wife would be no prize, but this situation is so healthy that he flatters himself with the hopes that my health will be

good. so long as I am able to talk and laugh he appears satisfied and I have learned not to complain. We spent 2 days in Pittsburg Pittsburgh at Mr. Wm. William Bell's where we saw Mrs. Anderson though not so pretty as when I last saw her, is a very fine looking old lady for 65. she and Mr. Wm. William Bell's family received me with much affection and there also I saw Mr. Bell's son William and his daughter Martha , the latter is going to school in Pittsburg Pittsburgh they both received me with so much cordiality as was quite gratifying, Wm William lives at a furnace 3 miles from here but has been at this place since I came here, he says Mother so affectionately and respectfully that even the most fastidious would be pleased. Wylie is a very intelligent boy, and Theodore is the most interesting one I have known ( The parson always exrehted exerted ) had I met with him at an acquaintances, I would have caressed him more than I do here, it shall not be said that I make great pretensions. If the children would only call me Sister I should feel more at home Miss Gormly has

lived so long in the family that she feels quite a sisterly regard for Mr. Bell and I dare say thinks herself in duty bound, to pay every attention to his wife, She attends to the domestic concerns, and I sew and knit as I did in Clover Dale and read for Mr. B. Mr. Bell as I did for my father. This is a handsome situation for Iron works, on the river Alleghanny Allegheny The dwelling house is frame with five rooms, 2 down stairs downstairs and 3 above it is not finished and they are building an addition of 4 rooms and when completed, will be quite a comfortable house. Mr. B. Bell had his furniture brought from Phila Philadelphia , carpets & Piano &c et cetera . Tell M if she will only come out here she may on a sofa and read novels, or fancy herself a heroine of romance. I have been quite disappointed in not hearing from her before this, I have been here two weeks without receiving a letter, and find whether Clover Dale , Phila Philadelphia or Cornplanter, to hear frequently from my absent friends is necessary to my happiness. I had intended to have written you a letter instead of this scrawl, but we have had company till a late hour, and I shall have an opportunity of sending this to Franklin early tomorrow morning, but I will write to Caroline next week and as Postage will cost you nothing I wish you would keep a diary

of all that is passing at Clover Dale and send me weekly. Tell Wm William Wylie and Theodore speak frequently of him, the latter is delighted with the idea of going with me to Tennessee to see him.
