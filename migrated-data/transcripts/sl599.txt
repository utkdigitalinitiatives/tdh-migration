Matamoros, Mexico Decr. 31. 1846 Dear Sir: Herewith you will find enclosed a very hastily prepared Muster Roll of my Company as it is on this day, together with a brief notice of its march & its future condition Maj Genl Major General Patterson's Division, is to day & will be tomorrow in Victoria, the Capital of the State of Tamaulipas __ 230 miles South S. West from this place. I went to San Fernando, 90 miles, but was on the 28th ordered to march back to this place, to procure supplies for the army. No Troops are now, or will be left on this route.__With 50 or 60 men, & about 100 teamsters I am ordered to march to Victoria, through the bilingo country. We do not expect opposition yet we know that any of the Towns intervening, together with a few neighboring ranchos, could assemble 4 or 500 men, to dispute our passage. We do expect it, because we believe, that a majority of the people are averse to engaging in our military expedition__ Genl General . Couales, is said to be 30 or 40 miles north of San Fernando, with from100 to 500 Rancheros: again he is reported to be within a few miles of the City. Yesterday, when we came in sight of Town, a sectorial reported 500 Cavalry in sight; a patrol was sent to resist us, & the whole city seemed to be quite alarmed, until they saw we were friends, and not Mexicans under Couales.

Tomorrow we leave, again to march the dry, & hot plains, this side of San Fernando: again to march from morning to night without water for ourselves or horses. N. inporte! Not important We can not complain. We came to serve our country, & we are now doing it. "The two points great points of our army says a great General, are the front & rear: & of the two the rear is the more important" So you see, although placed in the rear, we have a more dangerous march than if we had gone in front. Your kindness in forwarding the Muster Roll is gratefully felt. Please accept my thanks, therefore. Please present my dutiful respects to his Excellency, Gov. Brown, & say to him that I shall endeavor hereafter to send a copy of each Muster Roll of my company to your office, to be filed there, according to his request. I have the honor to be very much your mo. obt most obedient . friend Milten A. Haynes Capt Captain . Giles C Trooper Ten Rich Cavalry Genl General . R. B. Turner Adj. Adjutant Genl. Tennessee}
