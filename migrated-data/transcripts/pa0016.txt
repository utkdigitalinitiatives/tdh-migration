Chickamoga June 30th 1802 Sir As you have at length returned from from from S. W. Point . It is time to know how the horses stolen out of my possession belonging to the family are to be paid for, There being no positive ( altho although very strong circumstantial) proof against Estridge , it appears plain to me those horses ought to be paid for by the Government, agreeable to Tellico Treaty I may add agreable agreeable to Col Meigs own decision at the green corn dance held at Wellstown , which agreable agreeable to Wm Vann s report, of Wm Hicks , the public Interpreter runs this . That Shorey ought to Seize so much of Estridge 's property as would be sufficient to indemnify the loosers losers of the horses, and if there was not sufficiency found the UStates would make up the remainder, ,, as both Wm Hicks Wm Vanns speaks. I understand the English well, we could not suppose they could be deceived in the Colonel's meaning. I presume to think if any Indian horses stolen by whites are intended to be paid for under the treaty

those I mention undoubt ed ly have, These happening to be stolen out of my possession does not lessen the claim of the nation. Natives may send their horses on their necessary business to any post within their own boundaries, if stolen out of those boundaries by Whites, their claims on the UStates are as strong as if stolen out of the range. Hon Honorable Colo Colonel Meigs in whose integrity I have high confidence should afterwards deviate from his decision at Wellstown . I cannot accounte account for otherwise than by the false malicious statements of Enemies, who, I am well informed, told the Colonel that one of the horses for which payment was demmanded demanded was mine, tho though the contrary is well known can be made more manifest if required. You recollect on Estridge s return to the nation last winter, the grounds of the charge against him was submitted to your judgement, after afair a fair candid investigation you passed conditional judgement against him

which afterwards, by his own conduct became final, but the loosers losers of the horses have not been able to derive any benefit from that sentence, this failure is in a measure owing to the Colonels granting him some instrument of of of writing, the contents of which I can say nothing about, only from report, but be the contents what it may, it appears it served to favour favor his flight from this part of the nation to obtain from the Tortle at home , the horses lodged in his hands as security, he is now gone to Georgia , but whether he will have the audacity to return is uncertain You will excuse me Sir if I observe that an Agent could not exercise the function of an Agent to better advantage to the UStates , than to order all the Estridges out of the Nation, which I think may now be done without opposition. Calwell Miles have lived in every Indian Nation to the Southward have rendered themselves obnoxious to them all. The Cherokees have become their last retreat to the South, it

would be well to compel them to seek their fortune further abroad Shorey would be obliged to you to let him know as soon as possible whether he has any expectations from the Chief Agent on this subject or not. With due consideration I remain Sir your most Ob Servt Obedient Servant Daniel Ross Major William Lovely Agt Tennessee Agent
