Nashville , 24 December 1835 Uncle Finis Yours of the 22nd October came duly to hands enclosing $50.00 for which I thank you are so candid in your remarks on my church history the candour candor almost borders on severity Pray where do I hold out the idea, that immersion is the proper mode of Baptism True I state the fact that in the 1st Century the practise obtained now had you read a little farther on you would have found it stated that they immersed females naked. Can it be infered inferred from that statement that I believe such a practise consistant consistent with the discipline of the church of Christ But, in my opinion the last inference is as fair as the first But as Uncle Fine appears to have read only the 1st Century and with the same object in view that a certain methodist preacher had when he read a page or two about Wesley. viz videlicet to kick the Scotchman I will not cavil about it but bear my Kicking with all meekness and if I live to publish a second edition I will so surround and satisfy and explain both these statements that no man will believe that I view immersion as the proper mode whether the subject be naked or clothed

I do not know whither whether I will want the $200.00 or not in spring but 10 percent interest is certainly usury and I am Sorry to hear that your state authorities sanction such conduct. You talk of 6 errors in that Lectures come up to 20 and we may strike a bargain usury notwithstanding I have not yet get the paper for your work but will publish a prospectus and have the work out by the assembly. But if I wait the brethren get a sufficient number of subscribers I will wait until my head is gray. I Know them to too well to expect much in that way. So you must excuse me I have set my heart on the publication of the Lectures and if the Lord in his providence does not say no the brethren may say what they please, Ill bring the book out if I have to peddle it off myself. What a blessing I have gotten before this for the typographical errors in Br Brother Ewings last sermon well now it is too bad that my brethren should have me running all over the country dunning for a little money to meet demands on the office and thereby expose me to the censure of those whose productions are mangled and murdered in my absence; But in earnest before I left

I corrected the sermon twice but find the last were neglected to be inserted Shall the Pulpit live or die? I have only 2 or 3 sermons on hand cant begin the 2d vol volume without a better supply. what will Uncle Fene do? Some of the big brethren within a thousand miles of Cumberland College would write were it not for the ssociation!!!! Could Br. Ewing by some means inform such (without comitting committing me) that their bigness savers savors not of the spirit of the Gospel. Two sermons from Loury in the last number worth their weight in gold. The date of your letter with fifty dollars I mention ureny I have not the proper letter before me very affectionately yours in best bonds Jas James Smith P.S. Post Script That is an old adage "A fool and his money are soon parted" Dont however design to hint that you acted unwisely in giving an incompetent brother 25 cents to read my letter and gave away your money for nothing. Maybe he will attempt this for 50 cents and choak choke at it before he is done My Printers Devil will undertake it for fourpence, half penny and board himself while he is at it. aye and pay half a cent for every word he mises misses . Ye must be poor readers in Missouri
