House of Representatives Washington Oct October 5. 1837 Sir, I have received your letter and have delayed an answer for the purpose of obtaining the information you requested. As to the claim of Mr Fair , nothing can be done until the regular session, a law will have to be passed for his special benefit to enable him to get his pension for the time that he was dropped or stricken from the pension roll and this congress determined early in the session that they would entertain no business except that which touches the recommendations in the Presidents message, This was against my wishes, but I assure you that nothing can be done until the regular session, at which time I will use every endeavor to have a law passed to remunerate him for his lost time It will be necessary to take the evidence to show that Mr Fair was improperly droped dropped by

the commissioner of Pensions. the case will be refered referred to the committee on claims, and if it is sufficiently made out to receive a favourable favorable report from that committee I doubt not but that the law can be passed. As to the claim of Mrs. Kezia Mc Carroll I have not been able to obtain any information, which will be of service to her claim. I have addressed Mr. Edwards the commission of Pensions, upon the subject of her class case, but have not yet received an answer,_ As soon as I have learned from him, the specific objections to her case, and what is the point needing additional proof I will write to you & let you know_ I have enquired of the Representative from New Jersey & from the district of Morristown & he can give me no information about the persons or families you named in your letter.

I learned that the Hon. Honorable Lewis Condit of Morristown will probably be able to give more information about it than any one else, as he has been engaged in the pension business. I will write to him, as soon as I get an answer from the Commissioner of Pensions should that answer make it necessary to obtain further information._ I shall be at home by the last of this month, and will then see you & cheerfully attend to any business here which you may have_ In the mean time I am with respect your Obt Servt Obedient Servent Wm B Campbell Adam Ferguson Fergusson Eqr Esquire

I have only to add that the administration party having the majority in this house introduced a resolution declaring that it was inexpedient to charter a national Bank, and without permitting discussion have called the previous question upon it & cut off all debate_ They are determined to keep out the light, to keep the people in darkness if they can & to prevent a fair discussion as long as they have the majority_ If I could have got the floor I should have said something upon that resolution _ at the regular session the Bank question will be brought forward by its friends_ & then we will be heard. your &c and etcetera W.B. C. Campbell
