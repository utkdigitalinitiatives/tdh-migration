Head Qrs. Headquarters Eastern Division TN Athens Ten. Tennessee Nov 9th 1838 Memorandum. This last requisition for funds to defray the expenses of Twelve land detachments of emigrants, takes the numbers so emigrated, from the several muster rolls in the possession of Capt. Page , disbursing Agent c et cetera which muster rolls make the whole number emigrated, by land, under the arrangement entered into with me, 11721 souls. But the Cherokee authorities, a party to that agreement, allege, that after several of the muster rolls were closed, many additional families and Individuals joined the detachments in March increasing the twelve detachments emigrated, by land, to the aggregate of 12608 emigrants making a difference of 887 Souls. Should this be found to be correct when the said land detachments shall be finally mustered West, an additional requisition may be made by the Cherokee authorities for the excess of individuals, whatever the number, over and above the number of 11721. Who have been in this Country mustered in the twelve detachments which are now on the road.
