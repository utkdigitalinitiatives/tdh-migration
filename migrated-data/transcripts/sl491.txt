Paris Ten Tennessee 30 June 1844 Dear Gideon To give wings to a few dull Moments and Promote another object I now attempt writing your a few lines. I am in the enjoyment of tolerable health & so are the Cols Colonel's family & the people generally about here. I have been at home about two weeks. I spent several days in Davidson on my way from Marshall and I thought I done some decent courting, at any rate, I know I courted at a decent looking girl; but I was in the worst fix for doing anything of the kind that I ever was on any life, The weather as you will probably remember, was oppressively hot & I generally lead two of the worst sort of boils under one or the other arm: there causes kept me a little more than half sick & at last forced me off a little sooner than I would have left under other circumstances. But not with standing all these difficulties I think I got along tolerably well. The business of selling goods is with us, at this time, quite dull; people generally have tolerable prospects for crops of corn & tobacco- very little excitement about the Govs Governor's election. Ours you know is a modern democrat county_ we have two democrats out for the lower branch, is Frazier & Col Colonel Copeland , both in favor of repealing the "?pling act" we have one whig opposed to it should the locos continue to run we will lay

it on them. tho' I think the whiskey law will be more the question than federal polities at any rate it will divide each party against themselves Polk & Jons are to be in town next week and will have a good crowd. I see that the union! correspent correspondent from Shelbyville says that Long corners your man Baxter at every point, the Col says if this be true, your men cant be much. The Locos all here had little or nothing to say against the message & until they saw what the union and its correspent from washington said of webster's letter to Fox they admired it very much__ Since that they dont think so well of it. Gid Gideon , If I live & am well I intend visiting Nashville again on the 1 Aug August __ & if I can wind up my matters there as I think I can I will be out to see you in the last of the first week of that month and I want you to hold yourself in readiness to go with me. I think I can shine. If I can I will depend on you for the first pig &c etcetera after myself. You remmember remember that I told you I wanted to do the raking myself. But I think you will be well suited if blood will suit you ie id est if you call Bell blood Paris. We have a good deal of rain for the last two weeks, it now looks like being dry and very warm & I fear that we will be sickly again this Season tho if I Keep up a few days
