November came to hand, and I am truly gratified to learn that you are pleased with the manner in which I have conducted your business in this county — My business here, at the present ⁁ time is very much complicated, and requires all the energy and industry that I am master of to keep pace with it — I have a great deal to do as Sheriff & Collector — also surveying — Bank Agent — and agent for many individuals for selling & leasing lands in my county — making in the ⁁ whole with my own business a very heavy task — but I have done it heretofore & I have no doubt but I can still continue to do it satisfactorily to all parties — no exertions shall be left untried to lease your lands according to instructions, and that on the best possible terms — No person has yet applied to redeem any of the lands purchased for you — but if they do, your instructions shall be strictly adhered to — I have not heretofore kept any regular acct. account between us, but I will commence it from this year I will continue it hereafter — the amt. amount paid by you before this year can be settled by the receipts which are now in my possession — vey very Respectfully your obt servt obedient servant Jno John Charlton Jno.

P.S. Please enquire of Mr. Jesse Wharton whether he has paid into Bank the amt. amount of his loan in this county for the present year with the fees on the sheriffs deeds which I procured for him according to the acct. account transmitted by me to him a few weeks since — perhaps you can learn this from the offices of the Bank Respectfully JC John Charlton
