Gentlemen, The reasons I have to offer for an application to you for the name of the author of the article signed " A Citizen of Nashville " are such as must, I think, readily suggest themselves to your minds. The article in question contains a direct personal attack upon me by name, in such a manner is according to all the principles of fair dealing, entitles me to know by whom I am this assailed: and when an editor admits such articles into his columns, I have always understood him bound to make known the name of the author to the person assailed, or as assuming, by a refusal, the responsibilities of the authorship upon himself. Under these circumstances, I presume you will no longer hesitate to comply with my request. Yours &c and et cetera W.G. Hunt Nov. November 13, 1824
