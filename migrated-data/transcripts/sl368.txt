September 20th 1818 Dear Brother I have recieved received your affectionate letter dated August 12th and with a sense of thankfulness write you that you may welcome it as cordially as I did yours. I have already informed you of Grandfathers death, and the pain he suffered before his departure. He has gone from our sight but his memory lives, lit let us be mindful of him, and mark his steps as long as we may enjoy life this world. Your advice to me concerning our Grandfathers rules and regularities are remarkably good and quite interes ting It is my sincere wish that we may never be so delighted with the follies and vices of the world as not to pursue Grandfathers instructions and advice The time is approaching brother we will have to transact all the varieties and turns of life within ourselves and by our own assistance. Our principal guide is gone; that is Grandfather he is no longer alive to aid and assist through the amiguous ambiguous courses of life. I was very much rejoiced your when I recieved your letter to hear of your
