Dear General, June 1st 1828 I have just bu been informed that one of my negroes has been convicted of breaking open a store near Williamsburg and sentenced to be hung.__ You will excuse the liberty, I have taken, as well as this scrawl__ my health has been very bad, ever since I had the pleasure of seeing you at Washington which has prevented me from returning home, I am still under medical advice. I have to request it as a great favor to be permitted to send the negro out of the state, I am unable and have been confined, in Maryland , and it appear, my enemies are determined to ruin my estate__ I have reason to believe, his [unclear] his trial was not an impartial one, and his he evidence from some of the negroes were coerced.__ I feel much agitated and believe this justice will not be done, I therefore as a friend to humanity and citizen of Tennessee want by your permission to send him out of the state__ you will excuse this scrawl, and accept my friendship. Your obsev obedient servant L.T. Greenfield
