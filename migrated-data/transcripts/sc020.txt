Hermitage March 25th 1822 Dear Call By last mail I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 24th ult. ultimo and am pleased to learn that Mr. Brakenridge had shewn shown you my letter upon great consideration, on the recpt receipt of the documents, and a sight of Fromentines letters to the Sec. Secretary of State (for baseness, Falshood Falsehood impudence has not their parralel parallel , and which the Judge never expected to be before the public) I adressed addressed a letter to Mr Monroe , calling on him for an explanation in a friendly way, of the "good cause he had to believe" that Fromentine myself thought we were both acting agreable agreeable to our respective powers; as he has expressed in his communication to Congress on the 5th of Decbr DEcember last. and to be consistent, and not to depart from my friend untill until I had a full explanation with him, or untill until I had satisfactory proof that he had departed from me, I enclosed him a copy of the enonimous anonymous letter, dated at Augusta Georgia the 29th of Ocbt October last a copy of this letter I will send you by Doctor Bronough let it have been wrote by whom it may, what he has informed me was in contemplation, has thus far taken place, and the time manner of my resignation being

is well calculated to confirm a belief that Mr Monroe is, has been acting the double part by me, my resignation is excepted the 31st of Decbr December and Mr Whitmans resolutions the 2nd of January it is postmarked the 9th of January , seven days after Mr Whitmans resolutions, and in which debate it was intimated that I resigned to prevent an impeachment, however I was fortunate; for before I recd received Mr Monroes letter of acceptence acceptance , I had seen the resolutions in the National Intelligencer, and wrote by the next mail, both to the president the speaker of the house of Representatives to the first to withhold the acceptance of my resignation, and to the latter to assure congress, if my Resignation was accepted of before my letter reached the president, that I stood ready to meet any charge that might be brought against me and would plead personally as tho I had not resigned. The speaker has not laid my letter before congress nor has Mr Monroe made any communication to the house I will await his answer to my late letter if he chooses to explain, that explanation is satisfactory, I will be silent, but should he not answer my my letter, or if he answers that should not be satisfactory, I have determined on my course and when I state the facts to the nation If I mistake not the public, will Judge rightly and Mr Monroe will go out of office with less

popularity than any President that has preceded him I have been perfectly silent, and mean to maintain that course untill until congress, disposes of the Florida business I have not ever wrote to one member of Congress, nor do I mean to do so but I trust when it is over I shall speak, and that with effect. When my friends at Pensacola reads Mr Fromentines letters to the Secretary of State, I expect find hotweather hot weather there and I think when my friend Duncan gets a sight of them, he will have a warm hot bed in Neworleans New Orleans , his language as it respects Mr Duncan is of such a kind, (if F Fromentine was worth notice then his ears might be in danger. I have no doubt but he dreams of horsewhips cowskins every night of his life when you read these letters you will be still more surprised how Mr Monroe could consistent with Justice to me, introduce the thing to congress in the manner he has done Mr F. Fromentine has introduced Mr Brakenridge as a channel through which he has recd received some information he details Where is the Judge, present me to him if with you Mrs J. Jackson desires to be presented to you affectionately Lt. Lieutenent Donelson is at Lexington studying law, the two Andrews request to be remembered to you. Present me affectionately to the officers of the army, and all friends, and believe me to be as usual your sincere friend Andrew Jackson P.S. Post Script My health is slowly improving Capt. R.
