Cropland May 13th 1829 Dear Father Whar What an unuterable unutterable pleasure whould would it be to me, if I could say that my pen was now grasped to answer a fond letter from you assuring a far aistant assistant but affectionate son that all were well, or that fortune had not blessed you with good health; for it is better to learn within than remain for months in a state of entire suspence suspense ; of ace the evils to which the mind of man is addicted there are more so tormenting, so insupportable as that of deep and unatterable unutterable suspence; and that too which could be mentioned by the recitation of thee words all are well I returned to this place from New Orleans on yesterday a few days before my departure for that place I added you a letter to sister, from whome whom I fondly hoped on my return to have receive an answer to some of my previous letters in this and excitment excitement has succeded succeeded .

Thomas is still at Hynsons his health is good, he is getting along I think very well; and there is but little doubt but that he will with his present economy accumulate a handsome property in a few years, he had been badly treated with respect to his Legacy, has not as yet received it in full, he has judge Overtons note for 200 dollars, has recived received a share from Hydor and drew a draft on Henry Overton a few days ago for the valance, He has become much attached to this country and with it Avanier incolales. Cousin Thomas is still on Cropland , his health at the is not very good at this time, he complains of a pain in his side & the back ache, the fore runners of old age It was with much astonishment that shares the condice of your ex governor, who I think had vilified and disgraced himself in the eyes of the whole humane race, I am all most ashamed to hail from a state, whose Govenor Governor has thus bereaved himself and the State
