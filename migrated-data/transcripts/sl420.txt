Copy Carthage State of Tennessee 20th November 1837 Sir It has been about 46 or 7 years Since my Parents have left your country the land of their birth and relations, and Sought in the then wilds of the United States of America a country more Suitable to their inclination. Having myself been born and raised in this country it would Seem that I might be content myself with the knowledge of having decended descended from the true Highland race: but having heard my Parents Speak of Scotland and the friends and relations they left behind makes me anxious to know Something more about our family conections connections at the distance of almost half a century of time it would be idle for me to adress a letter to any one of our friends living at the time my parents left. We have never heard but little about them Since that period and that little has been verry very unsatisfactory. Believing that most of them are past away and that their children Suply Supply their places and those not known to me I take the liberty to adress you the first letter making you the organ of our communication between until I find who to adress. My mother was raised at Dalmaley Dalmally the place where I am informed you act as a your Post office is now established and you are the Post master before her marriage Her name was Isable McNable her family

ranks among the oldest in you country The family of McNable had lived on a Small hill close to the Cuplick Inn at Dalmaley and occupied the farm and its priveledges privileges my uncle Alexander McNable was remarkable for his excelling in making dirks and other cutlery. My fathers family lived about a days Journey I expect as near as I can guess north at a place called ASedale where an ex tensive state query was in operation they as well as others were engaged in making State the Small farm on which they lived was named I think Killride as well as I my recolection recollection Serves me my uncles were John and Archibald Fergusson my fathers name was Duncan Fergusson the oldest of the Brothers. I have thus given you Some account of my relations left in your country and of whom I have heard my Parents in their lifetime Speak You Sir will do me a great kindness by handing this letter to one of the nearest decendants of either of the above families and also to the one most likely to keep up a correspondance correspondence with me I have a great deal to enquire about more than can be contained in a Single letter which I have no doubt would be interesting to them as it would be gratifying to me. I am anxious after So long a lapse of time to renew those ties of blood and affinity that binds friends together even though they live in distant climes and you Sir can be the means of relieving that anxiety by introducing friends and relations to each other who though not forgotten are at this time Strangers. You

Sir can remove the Spell that locks up the avenues of corespondance correspondence and cause us at least to Speak to each other I have reasons to believe that many of my friends live in the United States but as yet I have found but few of them and those few are none of those left in Scotland at the time my father left and came over. I am induced to believe that they have emigrated many of them to other countries and live like me unknown by their friends. You will be kind enough to write to me an answer to this and let me know what information you can about them. Both families had numerous relations and I am thinking will be easy for you to impart information to them If however any of them are living in you country and Should See this letter I ask of them to commence the correspondance imediately immediately by writing to me They will give a general History or account from 1790 the time I think my father and his family embarked to this country to the present Stating who are yet living who may have died and who may have come to the United States of America or went elsewhere and what part of the United States they may now live in I hope you will pardon the trouble this may give you and hope though a Stranger you will accept the assurances of my great esteem and friendship Adam Fergusson
