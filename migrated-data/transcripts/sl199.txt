Plain Dealing October 1, 1837 My Dear Sisters, On several of my last letters to Brookville , I made a promise, or mentioned, that I would write to you in some short time, in case Mary 's health, did not permit her writing to you. The state of her mind, rendered so, by her peculiar situation, unfitted her for anything like social correspondence, though she frequently expressed a wish to write to you, yet she never carried her desire into execution, therefore at this time I write at her request and in her behalf, and situated as she has been for more than three months, with a greater or less degree of uneasiness pressing her mind, she, I know, will be excusable with you, who have charity abundant enough, to overlook even faults, much like reasonable excuses. Now her trouble is over she will? have no excuse. She has a fine looking boy, that was born on the 21st day of Sept. September She is setting up at present attending in a partial degree, to her domestick domestic concerns, and the little baby is quite hearty. We have not named it as yet, as we are at a loss, what name we shall adopt, being disposed to give him some name of which no little boy in the Perkin 's family has the same. Three already, have been called after the grandfather, and you know, it is my disposition, to be a little different, and to depart from common customs, for to name him, John Samuel, would be after myself and after his two grandfathers; a name the least objectional, if it were not, the common custom. I admire the name Charles or Frederick, and and and as ⁁ an evidence thereof, I call all my horses Charley, without acception exception . I propose then to call him Frederick, rather than Charles, so as

to distinguish and rather to prevent confounding the name of horses and human beings on the same plantation (excuse me for occupying time & space with reasons, already too tedious) I received by last mail, a letter from brother, which informs me of the safe arrival of Thomas at Brookville. I was truly sorry to hear of his indisposition, but I hope he has recovered long before this time, and he has been enjoying himself, in the society of those with whom he formerly lived. I wrote to not to hurry himself back, that all things which concerned him here, were going on well. I got a letter from Miss Patsy Noel this morning, she informs me all things are going on well at Brooklia, and the negroes in good health. Dr Stith lost one of his likliest likeliest young fellows. Tell Thomas at his plantation near Brooklia His overseer too much I expect a great many sick. I am getting tired of being confined, so closely at home, I shall leave home, as I have some business abroad that needs my attention, when I shall leave home, I unable at present to say. Brother mentioned something about a revisal of Campbellism among the neighbours neighbors . O, how strange it is to look back and behold what changes take place in the world! But a few short years ago, I was a student at school, at the gate near Mr. Harris' , now I am in Tennessee , living at a house of my own, and have charge of a small family, with all the cares & responsibilities attending it. Thomas no doubt has told you, how I have laboured labored and expended money to have every comfort and convenience about me, which this country affords. I have a beautiful little farm, rather a

source of amusement and expense, than a matter of profit. I would say of it ; that it is just such a summer retreat, as would suit a wealthy Louisiania Louisiana planter. It does not suit a poor man like myself for it consumes all my time & income in keeping up appearances. You know I am fond of pleasing my eye, even at a ? price. Now I feel, that I would feel; that I was fully compensated for expense & trouble, if the family at Brookville could spend one short year with me, and enjoy themselves in these strange woods. Tell father, I am glad to hear he enjoys such fine health, I am in hopes yet, he will visit Tennessee. Crops of corn & cotton are worse in this neighbourhood than they were ever known to be. Crops in the District are have been picking out cotton about two weeks. Cottons opens slowly. I have employed an overseer for next year at $150. The same man I had when Thomas was here. I expect to start to the District in 3 weeks. Hoping these lines may find you enjoying the blessing of health is ⁁ the prayer of your brother. Mary unites with me in sending her love to you, and every member of the family. You must write often to me, and I will answer all your letters with great pleasure, Though I am not in the habit of writing, in the night time, as formerly, owing to the want of eyesight, and thereby, am deprived of one of my greatest earthly enjoyments, I mean corresponding with my friends. Yr. Your Brother affectionately . John S. Claybrooke

I wish they were here, with their Aunt Mary & Uncle John to keep us company, for I know of nothing at present, that would afford me more pleasure than the society of some of my own kindred. P.S.
