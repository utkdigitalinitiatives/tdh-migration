Washington Feb February . 18 1833 My Dear Wife I am trying to wear away the tedious & heavy hours of night by thinking of Home and all that Home means - Superinduced by the stilness stillness and sadness of night I have thought myself into a most delicious melancholy - I declare I never feel so conscious that I have an immortal soul and feel and know its workings so well as when I am in this mood - a month more by Divine permission and I will once more clasp to my arms more objects which alone bind me to existence. - I am well. Yr Your Husband W William Fitzgerald
