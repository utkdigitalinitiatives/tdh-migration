March 25th 1836 Dear Andrew Your letter and notes was received last week, but I could not make it convenient to close the business with Ward before yesterday I now have his deed, signd signed , seld sealed , and delivered in presance presence of witnesses, the land is yours and I think you have a first rate bargain in it altho although a few years sinc since , he swore possitively positively , that you should never have one inch of it, the fates has decreed it otherwise, and proves that promises should never be made rashly or in anger- when I came to close the bargain with Ward he contended that the notes you sent me were dated wrong that they should have been dated the 4th Feb February instead of the 4th March, which was the time the bargain was made in consequence of this I had to draw a new sett set of notes and sign them as your atturney attorney , I think he begins to feel the importance of time as some of his neighbours neighbors once did= I have two negro fellows that I would sell if I could supply their place with better (George and old Nelson) I wish you would let me know what you can do for me in the business, if strong healthy young fellows of good character can be baught bought and braught braught out for the same sum that I could sell these for

I would do so, if you can make the purchases I will either send you on the money necessary or or or get Mr Hill to accept your drafts for the amount required= your are under a mistake about the lane, running from your church cotton field to Wards house, it commences near 40 poles west of your spring branch and runs nearly parralell parallel with it as far as your line goes 136 po poles giving you a plenty of the western hill sinde for grass lotts lots , now handsomely laid off in small lots, the difficlty difficulty in making the line straight with your line was, owing to the land belonging to Indiana Ward and could not be sold with out a decre decree of court even in the purchase that is made there is 2 or 3 acres included of her land= we are all well and send much love to our friends at the city= Yours Respct. Respectfully William Donelson
