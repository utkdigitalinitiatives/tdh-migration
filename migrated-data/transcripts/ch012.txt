Washington City 28th Dec. 1831. John Ross Esqr. Esquire Dear sir, The Delegation arrived here on the 20th instant have for the first time visited the War Department on this day. Gov. Governor Cass is unwell, therefore, we did not see him, but left word that a Communication, touching the affairs of the Cherokee Nation would be sent for the consideration of the government. We have on purpose delayed the memorial, which, is required of us to Congress present to Congress, to see what the Legislature would do, (in Georgia ) in regard to our Lands. From information, which has reached us, we presume, the Grand Crisis is of an outrageous character is now approaching, in which Georgia is to attempt to force herself in to the possession of our Country so far as is embraced by her Chartered claims in defiance of all human justice the solemn guaranties of the Union. The The Leave on this subject has not yet reached this place. Messrs Messieurs John Ridge Elias Boudinot have enjoyed an interview with Henry Clay , who has given the strongest assurance of his

his friendship to our people, when an opportunity presents in the Senate to aid our cause. So far as his influence talents can go, he may expect all his exertions. After presenting the Cherokee Memorial, which will be in a week, we are of the opinion, that it will the interests of our Nation to have it supported by an energetic expression of public sentiment. To effect this it would seem that coordinate movement should take place in Philadelphia , perhaps New York . John Mr. Ridge will therefore go with Elias Mr. Boudinott to attend to this address any meetings that may be called for the purpose. Elias Mr. Boudinott receives from various individuals, a good share of encouragement in the attainment of the objects of his Journey. The missionary case if it is acted upon, perhaps there is no doubt of that; by the S. Court, will it is assuredly believed, result in a favorable decision. The Creek Delegation, consisting of Opothle yoholo , Tukaubattchee hajo , Tuckaubatchee Micco , Higgins , Ben Marshall , Maj. Broadnax arrived here last night. Their object is to memorialize Congress on the subject of Intrusions c. et cetera William Mr. Wirt who has been dangerously ill, has recovered

his valuable services in the missionary case, may therefore be counted on. In this stage of the business of our Nation, it will be of course not proper to conjecture but the probable results of our application before Congress. Will the American people Sustain their Treaties Laws thereby perpetuate their fame unblemished untarnished by withhold ing the cruel sacrifice of the Cherokees to the avidity avarice of Georgia ? We will bring to the the test their faith! Honorably have we struggled so far in the difficulties, it should be our greatest desire to proceed in the path of honor, to our future generations have names of which they shall not be ashamed. The destiny of our nation, exposed as it is to the storms of political ambition, the zeal of our adversaries, causes the deepest feelings of concern in the breast of every Indian who loves his Country. But in the midst of our hills, we enjoy the consolation to know, that the best portion of the population of the U.S. sympathizes with us, are becoming awakened to a sense of the injustice practiced towards our people. It remains to be en seen, whether there is sufficient virtue among the white people to counteract the acts of their vicious population. If they achieve this, they may count

on the permanency of their hesitations: if they fail they will haste to the time when their existence as a prosperous nation, will vanish away, like the baseless fabric of a vision.
