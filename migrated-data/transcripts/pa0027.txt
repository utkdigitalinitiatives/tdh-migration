Fort Massac December 31st 1812. Sir We arrived at this place last evening and have this day received the public stores left at this place by Mr Saml Samuel Riley _we had a safe voyage down to this place. When at Colberts I have been informed that a party of whitemen who have built block houses on Tennessee river near the mouth, had killed three cherokees that was descending the river about the 1st Inst Instant ._ About forty miles above this place on the 28th Inst. we was haled hailed by a party of white men, and desired us to go to them, I inquired for what, one of them observed to give them the news. I told him we had no news worth their attention_ discovering that I was not disposed to go to them, he observed that they were directed by a Garrison of men near that place to stop every boats descending the river to examin examine if any Indians was on board

as they were not permitted to come about that place, and said if we did not go to them, that they would come to us, when they were answered to come on, he then observed that a boat had passed early that morning who had informed them that a party of Indians had followed them during the night before and said D__n his soul if the two men who then stood behind me was not Indians & that he would raise a company of men to pursue & kill us, I told they him the two men were Spaniards, and I did not regard their threats, he desired to hear one of them speak. Accordingly Peter spoke to them. they insisted that it was an Indian boat & mounted their horses & galloped off, a few miles below we concluded it was good policy to let Kalsatee out of the boat, & accordingly did, & appointed a place to meet him, but was disappointed in meeting, until yesterday morning the old man overtook us where we waited for him, one mile above the mouth of Tenn, after a disagreeable walk of about thirty miles_They however did not pursue us but am convinced that it may be imputed

to the independent manner in which I answered them, which confounded their apprehension of it being an Indian boat, the report of the three men being killed is confirmed at this place. but not certain to what nation they belong. Those men are represented to be a sett set of Bandits placed there by Genl General Ramsey of Kentucky or Ohio (whose character is equally atrocious) to commit depredations on Indians indiscriminate in place of being useful to the Government they are injurious_ means ought to be resorted to, to prevent further murders of inoffensive Indians until that period it will be quite imprudent & unsafe for Indians to attempt to descend the river. I have the honour to be with Sentiments of Respect & conside Sir yr Obt Servt your Obedient Servant Jno John Ross NB Nota Bene I have received all the articles specified in Lt Lieutenant J Prices receipt except the flat bottom boat.
