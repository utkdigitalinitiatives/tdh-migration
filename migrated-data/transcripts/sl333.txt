H. Holland by which I obtained his note, with Buck Hart security, for fifty dollars ($50.)__ when I left Tenn. Tennessee Holland refused payt. payment and I left the note with Mr. Farley for collection of Hart__ I received, about 2 years since, a letter from Farley stating he would soon get the money from Hart__ I have written him since but received no answer and am at a loss to know the reason being ignorant whether he still lives in Carthage or what has become of the note__ Will you have the goodness to make the necessary enquiry of Farley, or whom it may concern, and inform me of the result__ If Farley still has charge of the matter please request him to write me, or if his concern have been left with others, enquire of them__ If the note was never paid and Buck feels any desposition disposition to pay will you attend to the matter for me, or get others to do so who may have friendly intercourse with Hart__ Jno , Goodall for insta

It is a young and thriving state and above all Democratic, and I trust will ever remain so_ How have your schools prospered since I left are they flourishing_ What kind of times had you during, that last canvass not as warm I suppose as in '44 The contest here was very dull and no excitement at all_ The Whigs were it is true the successful party, but it remains to be seen whether they dare to change the policy of the late administration and repeal the wise and wholesome Laws that have sustained the government and the country in times of trouble and unusualdifficulties:

Let them attempt to restore their "obsolete" ures or revive the policy that has so often wreck them and they will at the end of four years be blown skyhigh and rowed to a point on salt river never thought navigable_ But political matters now seem dull & tame and I will not dwell upon them_ Accept my best regards to yourself and family.
