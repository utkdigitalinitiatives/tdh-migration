Knoxville 26th august 1803 Sir, Your's of 12th Inst Instant . has been received. It is truly to be lamented that those Villains continue their depredations on the road. The president is disposed to do every thing in his power to put a stop to the commission of such outrages and to bring the offenders to consign punishment. I wrote to the Secretary at war on this subject in June last and every measure then suggestion has been adopted__ a copy of his letter in reply is here enclosed I have heard lately that the infamous mason has been killed and that some of mr mister . Nash's property was found in his possession. Please inform me whether the report may be relied on, and if true what are the circumstances and by whom was so good an act done I am sir with sincere regard your Hum Servt Humble Servant Archibald Roane Genl General Winchester PS. I suppose you have heard the result of the late Election Sevier is Elected governor by a large Majority and Dickson Campbell and Rhea representatives to congress. The steady exertions of my friends are as grateful to me as if we had been successful.
