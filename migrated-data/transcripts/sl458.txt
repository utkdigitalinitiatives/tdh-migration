Columbia Jany January 21st 1844 - Private Gentleman: I neglected when I was at Nashville to suggest to you the propriety of placing Mr Van-Buren 's name at the Head of your column in your paper, as well mine__ it is now certain that Mr Van-Buren will be the candidate,__ and some of my friends out of the state__ do not understand- why it is, that my name is at the head of the column of the Union & Mr Van-Buren's is not. Some of my opponents- or rather some of those who urge the nomination of another for the Vice Presidency,- are attempting, to use the fact that Van-Buren's name has not been hoisted in your paper to my prejudice. If you see no objections therefore- I hope you will run-up his name__ subject of course to the decision of the National Convention__ I am Very Respectfully Your obt Sert obedient Servant James K Polk ___ Messrs- Hogan & Heiss Nashville Tennessee
