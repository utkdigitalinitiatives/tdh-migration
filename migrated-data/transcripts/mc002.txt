West Point N. New York August 13th 1832 — Dear Brother I take up my pen to write you a very short and hasty letter — I would write more lengthily but I have only a few minutes time, and the letter is intended merely as a kind of introductory one — The circumstance are these, Mr. Yoakum of Tennessee was here a short time since and spent several days at this place, and while here I promised to write a number of introductory letters by him to persons in Tenn Tennessee — This promise I fulfilled, before he left here, by writing to them all before except yourself, and I would have written to you at the same time, but he started rather sooner than I expected — Mr. Fain of Rogersville Tenn. Tennessee is just about setting out for home, and will overtake Mr Yoakum about Washington City , and I send this letter by Fain to Yoakum, who will deliver it to you — Mr. Yoakum promised me that he would see Father and yourself, for I knew that it would be gratifying to both of you to see some person who had seen me at this place and who could give you any information you might desire respecting it place When I arrived at this place Mr. Yoakum receivd received me more like a brother, than like a stranger, and while I remained here, which was about twenty days, he treated me with the greatest respect and took considerable pains to give me every necessary information respecting this institution &c et cetera — This course of conduct towards me was not only marked by the most disinterested friendship and benevolence, but he confered conferred on me many little articles which will be, not only Convenient and useful to me, but which will also save me considerable expense in purchasing them — I know it would always afford you the highest pleasure to pay a due degree of attention to any gentleman, but

if Mr. Yoakum should call I would ask you, on my account, to be particularly attentive to him — So far I have no fault to find with this place. We still remain in camp and it is even probable that we will not leave it sooner than the 1st of Oct. October — It is thought that it is best to remain in camp as long as possible on account of the Cholera — This place is entirely healthy. — We pay no attention to books in camp, and attend to nothing but military duty — I have written two letters home since I arrived here and would have been very glad if I could have heard from there before this time, but I hav have now been more than three months from home and have not heard a word from any of you since I left there — If you have not written to me when you receive this I hope you will write to me immediately — I wish to know how you succeeded in Alabama — I want to know what has become of the affair in Jefferson Cty County , and in short, I wish to know about every thing everything at home, in the neighbourhood neighborhood &c. &c. et cetera, et cetera — My health is as good, or better than it ever was — Give my love to the family, my compliments to all friends and neighbours neighbors — and I hope you will accept this hasty but sincere assurance of the continued love and esteem of your brother George L. Welcker To. C. Charles F. Welcker } P.S. Post Script This letter is directed to you, but of course, I could not object to its being seen by any of the family &c et cetera G. L. W George L. Welcker —
