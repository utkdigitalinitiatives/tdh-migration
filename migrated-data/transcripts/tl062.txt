Knoxville 20 December 1807 To the Black Fox head Cheif Chief of the Cherokee Nation Brother Your letter of the 27 of August last have come duly to hand I would have wrote you some time ago, but was waiting to get a report from Colonel Meigs to find out if possible in our powers who, or what nation of people had murdered some of our Citizens The Colonel about that time was going to Elk River , and promised he would endeavor to find out who had done the mischeif mischief , Since his return he has Written to me giving information, that it was the Creeks that killed the two men I am glad to hear it was not your people; but at the same time I am sorry to learn You suffer the Creeks to come so much among you, when you know they are enemies to our people, and always do mischeif mischief when ever whenever they have it in their power Would you not think it unfriendly in us, if we are to suffer another nation of people to pass through and live in our Country, who would murder and destroy your people When ever Whenever they had an opportunity? Yes brother you would think and rightly too, that we did not act like friends. I am informed that the Creeks have built Huts, and is living on the banks of the Tennessee ; what business have they there? They have none only to be convenient to kill some of our people, and plunder our Boats as they are going down the River You know the Creek people are Rougues Roug Rogues, and you say steal from and robb rob your own people: If it be true, why dont don't you drive them from out of your Country? for a people who both murder steals, aught ought not to be Suffered to live in any place You are Surely able

able to drive away the few that comes to do Mischeif mischief , and disturb the peace of your people and ours: If their nation means to protect them in their murdering and plundering excursions, you then know where you can resort to for protection and Strength enough to do your selves yourselves Justice I state these circumstances to inform You how you aught ought to conduct towards the white people, who are your Fathers, Brothers, friends, and your good neighbors. I dont don't wish to be angry with you, but to enlighten your understandings that you may know how to take care of your own nation (if you wish to continue such); and for you to prevent a bad people from doing damage to your nearest and best friends You say "that when any thing anything has been wrong we are advised to settle it without spilling blood." Such is the practice I wish to see adopted, and if the red people that killed our good and harmless men, had observed such a good rule, those poor murdered men persons would have yet been living with their families, and their blood not spilt. I have written to the Creeks , and shall wait patiently to hear what they have to say, and if it has been any of their people that committed the murders, I shall expect they will punish them agreably agreeably to the existing Treaties Laws established provided for such Cases; Should they refuse so to do, we shall then know what sort of people we have to deal with, and be prepared to protect our selves ourselves Some more occurrances occurrences my friend I must inform you of, their there is several complaints come forward, stating, that Several white people who have traveled by the way of what is called the Georgia Road , have been very illy treated by Some of your people, their property taken from them and their lives

lives threatened and endangered A fellow called good, or Sweet Water , at the Shoemake Village , lately killed some of Mr. Lush's hogs as he was driving through your nation to Georgia ; He also presented his gun at Mr. Lush (who is a very peaceable man) and threatened to shoot him I shall rely with confidence, you will enquire into those outrages, and put an immeadiate immediate Stop to such unfriendly and disorderly behavior; and also cause a just and full compensation to be made for the damages that have been done The way open for the Redress of these complaints is to put an end to the causes outrages that produces them, and I perswade persuade myself, that the cheifs chiefs of the cherokee Cherokee nation , will take prompt and decisive measures to effect it.
