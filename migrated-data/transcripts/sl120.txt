Bell , that he drunk drank tea with them, and was very much pleased with the family particularly the young ladies who sung sang and played charmingly. We received a letter last week for you from brother John , I opened it before I thought of their there being any thing in it but what you would have read to us, which was the case, he can tell you there was nothing in it worth preserving or sending to you, I will burn it if you wish, we also received one from Ellennora y her brother was here at the time and knew her hand writing, tell her I should judge from the tenor of her letter, she was agreeably disappointed to find Mr. Collier was still a single man, give our love to her. You must have taken brother on surprise as he did not expect you so soon, were I in your place I would feel much better satisfied now, than if I were under obligations to any of the Citizens of Nashville as some of them would not turn round to oblige you, William wrote a post script to my letter in Charlotte , informing you that James Gould could not send on your parsel parcel this spring or summer, as their there are no persons going on with whom he could send the Mr. and Mrs. Pearl have declined going this year, he purchased some articles for you I do not know what they were, we desired him

I wish you were here to see how well every thing looks, the fruit trees are in full bloom, in fact every thing speaks well for a good crop of fruit this year.

dear Sister You can easily imagine how much you are missed by us all, some of your friends are wondering how we shall possibly do without you. Dr. Carter observed last week when he was here at muster, if he remained in Dickson much longer he would lose all his friends. All the necessary arrangements were made in due time for the muster viz. videlicet plastering white washing, painting, &c &c &c et cetera et cetera et cetera though it snowed in the evening, and the day was very cold, it all passed off as it should have done, 16 gentlemen dined with us that day.
