New Orleans Dec December 18th 1850 My dear Alex I received your letter of the 2nd inst instant a few minutes ago and hasten to answer you I am very much obliged to you for the trouble you have been at in attending to my affairs with Robt Robert Warren . I left the notes with Messrs Messieurs Simpson, McAlister & Co Company for collection in April or May 1849 . One of the notes fell due on the 1st of July of that year and the other on the 1st of January 1850 . With verbal instructions to make the money when it fell due and although I have written repeatedly to the house of S. McA. & Co Simpson McAlister & Company I have never been able to hear from them but once and then they informed me that the notes had been put into the hands of Mr Irvine for collection. I greatly fear that the gentleman have so far neglected my interest any instructions as to cause me to lose a good deal of my claim if so and I have any hold on them at law I will make them smart for it, however that is "inter nos", Continue to do the best you can. William Warren is not now in the city but I believe he is here very frequently and I will see him and get the best terms I can out of him.

I wrote to you on yesterday and I then introspected that it was likely that I would start next week to Florence. I will certainly do so now and will most likely go by Saturday. I have the painfull painful inteligence intelligence to state that the Steamboat Knoxville just leaving this port for the Tennessee river with a valuable freight was blown up and the boat is now a perfect wreck, not many persons were killed right of off but it is more than likely several of the wounded & scalded will die. I refer you to the papers for a more perfect account than I can give. With our best regards to Ann , and to all the family. I remain yours truly & in haste Andrew J. Jackson Coffee
