Columbia Jackson Tennessee Oct. October 16th 1842 My dear Papa As there is no church in Town to day, I think that I could not better employ my time, than by answering your very kind letter. I can assure you that it was received with great pleasure, as your letters always are, but I must confess this last with more than usual, I was also a little astonished for I had began to suspect that you all thought it of no consequence whether I heard from home or not; I am very glad to see that I was mistaken but you must remember that you promised to write me at least once in two weeks. and Papa always tell me something about the dear Children, for I am almost distracted to see them. I awake very often in the night under the impression that I am at home and that little Sam is with me â€” I hope that you keep Emelina at her knitting . I am fearful that the children will not be so well fixed this winder as they have always been before. I promise myself to be more useful when I return. Indeed I am grieved to hear that Olivia Day has acted so very badly, how mortifying it must be to her Parents but I think that they are almost as much to blame as she is herself for they

have never given her any of the advantages of Education, and I suppose no good advice, (such as I receive from you upon that subject.) she has not displayed her good taste in selecting Mr McRee for I think that he is the last person that any one could fancy. Poor girl! I am afraid that she will "have her reward." I attended a small party at Mr. Wormleys on Friday evening and enjoyed myself very much, indeed I never was at a more pleasant Party. I was also invited to join a Pic-nic on saturday but owing to the days being so unfavorable it was given out. I felt a little disappointed for I know it would have been pleasant. We intended spending the day about two miles from Town at the Sulphur Springs , a very pretty place it is I am told. Papa I know that this does not interest you but I do not know what else to write about. Mr. Smith has requested each one of the girls to write home, and see if it is their parents wish that they should take Drawing lessons, but I think that I have as many studies as I can possibly attend to. he expects a Tutoress on in a few days, who will teach nothing but drawing painting & Embroidery. Mr. Smith placed me in a much higher class in French than I anticipated, for which you may be sure I felt pleased. I intend to try and keep up with it. You know that I never studied French but part of one Session before. Miss Lizzy (my Tutoress) says that she thinks that I will make a very good Scholar. Dear Papa think that it is almost time for you to fulfil fulfill your Promise which that you would come up to see me, I do hope that I shall not be disappointed. Tell Aunts Patsy and Narcissa that I am looking very anxiously for an answer to my letter, Cousin Jane and Aunt Frances that I should be delighted to receive a letter from them. I hope that you yourself will not be so tardy in

writing again. Give my love to all. Your ever affectionate Daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester
