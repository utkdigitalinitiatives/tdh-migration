Alexandria ( La Louisiana ) 4th December 1833 Dear Cousin It was my intention when I left to have written you on this, but on my arrival at home found every thing very much out of order. my overseer was a young man just from Virginia knew nothing of the managment management of cotton consequently my negroes had picked but little, my crop after the decease of ⁁ my beloved brother was badly cultivated. John had been his over seer— The cholera producing so great a panic that a man could not be employed at any price. though taking the difficulties of the season into consideration my crop is equally as good as I had a might to expect. my crop of corn is fine and shall make about two hundrd hundred bales avaraging averaging 400 lbs pounds shall finish picking tomorrow and will be ginning about two days I had written to my merchant to sell none of my crop under eighteen ⁁ cts cents but previous to reciving receiving my order he had sold forty eight bales which brought me $34.00 and have ordered the balance to be kept on hand untill until May when it is the impression of the knowing ones here that cotton must rise. I have not heard from home but once since I saw you the family was thus better, though father had lost another fine negro Negro Cherry. sister Sarah has not written me at all, I am at a loss to know what to do Mr Mister Hynson tells me Gmother Grandmother is coming down. should

that be the case, I shall expect him to come with her you will please see her fitted out in every thing that is necessary if she has not funds enough furnish her and the aunt shall be remitted by the first mail. our county is at this time perfectly healthy and we trust the cholerea cholera has left us forever and will be long remembered. negroes are selling at Natchez at $1400 and $1450 the pair run at 800 & 825 women at 600 & 625. it is hard to prostrate the enterprise of our beloved country if the cholerea does kill one half, my best love to cousin martha sisters Laura & Sarah aunt, Walter & the rest of my frinds friends , and tell Capt Captain Baily I hope that the seed of the tree ⁁ to make plank to box me up is not yet sprouted and that I wish him as I do every honest man to live in this world untill he is ready to say Go. God bless you all Write me Yrs Yours affectionately Tho. Thomas O. Moore Cotton has fallen still we anticipate a rise late in the winter or spring
