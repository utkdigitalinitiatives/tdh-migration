War Department July 9th 1802 Sir Your favor of the 18th Ult Ultimo has been duly received and its contents considered. The obstacles to opening the road through Davidson and Williamson Counties is to be regretted.__ Whether the troops retained in service will, in addition to the opening the remainder of the road to Natchez and their ordinary duties be able to complete that part of the road which was to pass thru through the aforesaid counties is doubtful__ When the opening the road was first contemplated there was reason to hope the whole would have been completed last autumn and winter But necessary delays in commencing the business prevented our hopes being realized. It is the ardent wish of the President of the United States to give every facility in his power to the communication between the citizens of Tennessee and Kentucky and the atlantic States and to render the trade and Navigation of the Western States as convenient as possible.__

He has it in contemplation to have a road opened from Tennessee to the boatable waters of Georgia .__ When your Legislature shall have decided on the most eligible rout through the counties of Davidson and Williamson is it not probable probable some aid will be offered by the State for completing the road?__ Every aid will be offered chearfully cheerfully in the power of the President for carrying into complete effect the original plan for making the road.__ But we ought by all the means in our power to guard against any unnecessary extension of the distance__ It ought not to be expected that a great public road made for the purpose of connecting two distant countries, and national purposes should be averted from the shortest and best route merely to accommodate the Inhabitants of a Single County I am respectfully your Huml Serv Humble Servant (signed) H Dearborn Archibald Roane Esqr Esquire .
