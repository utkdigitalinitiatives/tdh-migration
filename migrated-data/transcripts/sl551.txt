Bellview 10th Decbr December 1815 Dear Genl General There is nothing more within my recollection than that I did transfer to you on the plot & certificate my interest to our hundred fifty acres of Land lying on Ferrises Creek of Elk river If the grant has come out in my name as Col Colonel Anderson says there has been some mistake or omission to draw as you get the grant if in my name I will make the conveyance viz, a quit title one and in case of death on or other casualties which might prevent before the grant is got this may be considered my obligation for that purpose Is it not probable that if the European allies continue at pease armory themselves that in large a formadible formidable coalition will be formed agst against us. It is the Interest of legitimate Sovereigns to put down liberty wherever found. and as its root seems to be here they will try to pluck it up. Should this effort be made the conflict will be disparate. Congress ought to loose no time in puting putting the country in the best possible state of defense. above all things arms should be provided for every effective man in the nation. you know the increase of confidence a soldier receives from being well armed & equipted equipped . We hear that the Floridas are ceeded ceded to G.B. If true the object is easy understood I would be for forming a strong business on that frontier to this end. I would

let out the land got from the Creeks on terms which would warrant an immediate occupation of the country. Say, 160 acres to every family which made an actual settlement out 50 cents pr per acre. this would be worth mor to cash in case of a rupture with GB. than if the land would sell at $5 in the ordinary & slow way back with me on this subject soon as to our great men at the city. Our family are in health I hope you and your household are enjoying the like favor. Respectfully I am your friend & fellow citizen Wm Martin
