Hermitage Novbr November 21st 1819 Dear Andrew On my return from Florence I wrote you from Nashville a hasty scroll in the night — I fondly cherished the hope of receiving from you a letter on my return — on this I was disappointed — The recpt receipt of a letter from Edward dated the 25th inst instant gave me the pleasing intelligence that you were well — This was gratifying to your aunt and myself, being both fearfull fearful from your long silence that you were sick. — I am certain that at the advanced stage of your education you can attend to nothing more beneficial than writing — It employs the thoughts, expands the mind, and will give you by a proper attention an easy habit of communicating your thoughts. There is nothing so beatifull beautiful in writing as a plain easy stile style — Mr Madison excelled in this, and altho although Mr Jeffersons writings has met with the approbation that they meritted merited — I have always thought that the chasteness of Mr Madison excelled any american American author I ever read — It is by habit that this easy & plainess plainness of stile style , which I call Elegance is to be acquired — it is when writing to your friend, when you ought to be free from restraint, that you can exercise this freedom of expression, by which tone you will adopt that ease & plainess plainness of expression , ⁁ style that will lead you into the habit of the common use — When you know the pleasure it gives me to send your letters, why not amuse yourself in writing me — choose your own subject — and handle it in any way your Judgt Judgement may direct — it will give me pleasure to approve, or to point out your errors

if any should exist with the freedom of a friend, This will give you a confidence in yourself, which to become great you must acquire, keeping your mind allways always open to reason & convertion conversion — but never yielding your opinion untill until the Judgt. Judgement is convinced. Independance Independence of mind and action, is the noblest atribute attribute of the human mind man — he that possises possesses it, and practises practices upon ⁁ it, may be said to possess the real image of his creator — without it, man becomes the real tool in the hands of others, and is wielded, like a mere attomaton automaton , sometimes, without knowing it, to the worst of purposes hence the necessity, of all inteligent intelligent men, exercising the talent that God has given them agreable agreeable to that Judgt. Judgement that they possess, which they have derived from duty, improved by Education, and never abandoning it, untill until their reason and Judgt. Judgement are convinced that they are in error. This independant indepenent course gives a peacefull peaceful conscience, and when the public voice, being misled, disapproves the course, innocence Smiles with contempt at public clamour clamor — time, dispells dispels the mists' error from their eyes, & truth ultimately prevails when the independance independence of the individual is hailed, by all the approbation of all, and thus rewarded for his virtue & independance independence . your friends are all well and frequently inquiring after you — The first pride of my life has been gratified, at hearing of the honourable honorable station you now fill — This is the reward of your application and the proper course you have pursued — let it operate upon you, stedfastly steadfastly to persue pursue this proper course, without vanity, or pride — by which you can only reach per ferment in life that will be permanant permanent , that is by deserving it. I enclosed you in my last one hundred dollars in a bill of the Brones

I have again to renew my request so often repeated that you write me often, and inform me of your views and future intentions. your aunt & Andrew Joins me in our best wishes for your health & happiness — we are all anxious to see you so soon as your studies will permit; if we remain in peace I wish you to study love — and live with me — if we have war and I should participate in it, I will have you with me — but I hope our country will be blessed with peace, war is a great evil when it can be avoided, & a curse to any nation — present us to Edward affectionately & believe me to be your affectionate uncle Andrew Jackson Cadet A.
