Clover Dale August 1st 1838 Dear sister As you are aware of my aversion to letter writing, or to writing anything, I deem it unnecessary to make an apology for my long silence; had I been at home when I received your last letter I should have answered it immediately, as I generally feel more like answering a letter when I recieve receive it than sometime afterwards; but I was in Charlotte attending Presbytery and went from there to Harpeth with Major and Mrs. Bell . I spent two weeks very agreeably with them and our cousin I mean John I Bell's family, for we claim kin. I think Mary more inteligent intelligent than Elizabeth or Jane and Blunt is very well named, at least he is not at all smart. if I may be permitted to judge by the exterior. Mr. Bell is very easy, kind, and agreeable, indeed they are all so and if I had been their own cousin they could not have treated me more affectionately, Eveline is very zealous in the cause of religion, and very eloquent on the subject, but the change is not so great in her particularly as it regards her temper as we would wish, but she excuses herself by saying God gave her her tongue and temper as well as her religion, and that she has never had any doubts or fears on the subject, nor does she think a christian should have any. If this were true my religion is all a pretence, for I am often assailed with strong doubts and fears; but I am disposed to think otherwise, if I know

my own heart it is the predominant desire of it to love and serve the Lord, but amidst doubts and temptations I can indulge a pleasing hope that I know in whoom whom I have trusted and that he will not forsake me, nor will he suffer me to be tempted above what I can bear. The sacrament was administered during Presbytery and for the first time I was permitted to partake of that holy ordinance, for sometime previous to it I felt myself wholy wholly unworthy to partake of it, but upon accidently picking up a number of the Prebyterian, which contained some answers to objections against receiving the communion, which in a great measure removed my fears, and I trust enabled me to approach that holy table with deep humility and an humble reliance on the merits of my Saviours Savior's blood alone for pardon and acceptance, and for future guidance and direction, there were a great many communicants particularly of young persons, there were no converts and but two added to the church Robert Dunaway a nephew of Mr. Livingston and Margaret she never her sentiments made known her sentiments until the day before the Presbytery, when she declared from the change in ⁁ her feelings and disposition she felt it her duty to join the Church we were all made very happy at hearing her determination being so sudden and unexpected it created a great excitement among her friends the Session met at Mr. Balthrop's saturday evening when she gave her experience to the Church there were several persons present they staid to were very much affected Benjamin Robertson shed tears freely and observed to some one that he liked ⁁ her a great deal better now. There were four candidates for ordination John T Smith delivered the charge

it was very solem solemn and impressive, beyond any thing I had ever witnessed before. Mr. Burnie has improved in his preaching very much but I do not like his gestures I think them rather theatrical. We had a two days meeting at New Hope the middle of last month, there was a Temperance address delivered on saturday that society has lately had an adition addition of 18 or 20 members among whoom whom are two of the Mr. Neerly's who 6 months since were interested in a grocery in Charlotte . The Presbytery wish the Church to consider it a duty incumbent on them there to become members of that society, indeed in that I think they are perfectly right. D. Hardwick , wife & sister have ar r ived in Charlotte , Mrs. H Hardwick is small, & pretty but not near as intelligent looking as Eliza , she resembles the family very much. I saw a daughter of Tom Napiers mow Mrs. Carpenter at the Presbytery she is pretty, intelligent, and agreeable, and by far superior to any of the name I have ever seen. The weather has been extremely warm and dry for some weeks past. If it does not rain shortly the farmers will not make the third of a crop in this neighbor hood but we have a plenty of old corn and as much wheat as we can make use of. This neighbourhood neighborhood has been very healthy since the scarlet fever left it. Sally has been complaining for two weeks partly with the tooth acke ache and bowel complaint, she took a dose of tartar & salts it made her very sick, but she is better this evening. I hope Miss Gormly has regained her health. Mother sympathises sympathizes very much with Theodore in his illness she feels very much interested in your youngest pet . If peaches is the object of your contemplated visit to Dickson you had better stay at home there is not one on the place, nor are there as many in the neighborhood as will be sufficient for making preserves. I hope the failure of peaches

here will not prevent your visiting us this fall Mother says she will look for you after the middle of this month, Mrs. Mills ⁁ will cheerfully give you her share of peaches for a sight of you. Mrs. Collier says there is no person excepting her relations she had rather see than you. I resolved in my own mind before the steelpens Charlotte Ten Tennessee August 5th 1838 } 25 Mrs. Ann Jane Bell. Cornplanter . Venango County . Penn Pennsylvania came that I would endeavor if possible to write a very pretty neat body hand, but I am very sorry to say they are so indifferent that I have ceased to witle with them and we have not a pen on the place but a quantity of feathers. We all join in best love to you, Brother, children and Miss Gormly very sincerely and afftionately affectionately yours C. Caroline D. Bell
