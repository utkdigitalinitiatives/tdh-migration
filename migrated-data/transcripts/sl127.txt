Clover Dale November 4. 1838 Dear Brother I ought to apologize for not answering your letter sooner, being so much engaged in making and getting in the crop that I did not have leisure to write to my friends. You and sister Jane write so seldom now to what you formerly done, that I sometimes think you have forgotten your friends in Tennessee . This has been a very bad year on Iron masters, the summer and fall has been so remarkably dry that the furnaces had to lay idle for the want of water. I have Just finished getting in our corn, although it has been very much injured by the drought, we have housed about one hundred and thirty barrels, our wheat and oats crops were very good. I have a very hard piece of clearing to do this fall and winter, it is a field of about thirty acres, which has grown up entirely with bryars and bushes, probably you remember seeing it, as you passed

through it going to Charlotte . I should like to hear from you soon, and know whether you had raines rains sufficient to keep the furnaces in blast all summer. I expect that corn will command a better price here next spring than it will with you, it is thoug ht to be worth from seventy-five cts. cents to one dollar per bushel. I have sowed fifteen acres in wheat this year, which looks very flourishing at present. There is such a quantity of fruit on the chest-nut and oak trees this year that it will fatten the hogs without the assistance of corn, but there is one evil attending large fruit years, the hogs become very wild and have to be hunted with dogs and shot like you would a deer. Tell Wylie , and Theodore that I wish they had been here this fall to gather chestnuts, as they were very plenty. It was with deep regret that I heard of Miss Gormly 's low state of health, and knowing her worth I sympathize with you all, you have parted with many of your friends, and I think you ought not to grieve for them as those who have no hope. I hope Sister Jane's sickness is nothing dangerous, and is now well. I think a visit to Dickson would improve

you and Sister very much, I think you ought to pay us a visit when the river rises, as you can come in six or eight hours days Tell Wylie and Theodore that I would be glad to hear from them, and say I will ‚ÅÅ write to them soon. Each member of the family join with me in love to you all. I remain Your affectionate Brother William B. Bell
