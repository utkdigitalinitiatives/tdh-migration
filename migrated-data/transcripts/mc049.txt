Terre Haute, Indiana , Sept September 20th 1837 Dear Brother; It has been some time since I have heard any thing directly from you; and I suppose it has been equally long since you have heard from me. _ And now that I have commenced to write; it is not because I have any thing new, strange, or interesting to communicate that I do so; but rather because I know you will be pleased to receive a few lines from me, even though they should contain but little._ I have received but one letter from brother Henry since I had the pleasure of seeing you, and that informed me of the great loss you had sustained in the death of your little daughter: from yourself I have received nothing. It is but a short time since I received letters from sisters Catharine and Mary Jane: Catharine was at Majr. Major Lenoir s when she wrote__ she had been nearly a month in E. Tenn. East Tennessee and expected to set out for home in a short time.__ Mary Jane was at school in Kingston _ she had just been out at home, and left all the family well_ I say all the family, which was Father, Mother, Albert & Clinton_ things have been much changed since our day __ Frederick, Monroe & Franklin were at Knoxville, and from what I saw & heard, when last at Knoxville, I have no doubt they are doing well ____ In fact, there

are none of the family who have not, thus far, done well__ And I think it is incumbent upon us, as the elder of the family, to do, each in his own way, the best we can: for I have no doubt, that the conduct and character of the elder members, have a great influence in farming the character and fixing the destiny of the younger members of any family. I have not heard any thing of Col Colonel Mitchell or family since Henry wrote to me _ I should be glad to hear from them; and I am particularly anxious to know what disposition is to be made of our little nephews__ That Mississippi is a new & unhealthy country_ it is, & perhaps ever will be, an extravagant country_ it is now labouring laboring under a calamity, mainly to be attributed to the wildness & excess with which every thing has been conducted; a calamity from which it will not soon recover__ its society is unorganized & unsettled _ it is destitute of the comforts of life; it is destitute of schools; it is destitute of good & social feelings__ In short, it is not a country in which children should be raised_ and it is fit to be inhabited by those only who are willing to live but few years, and who are willing to spend those few years in killings mules & negroes, in raising Cotton, & in endeavoring to make money._ Those children could be raised and educated in E. Tenn. for one tenth of the expense, and would have better Constitution, better health, better sense, stronger minds & stronger bodies, more energy of Character, and would, in fact, be entirely different & better men.

I want to hear from you_ I want to know how you are getting along in the world_ What kind of a crop did you make?_ What are your Calculations & prospects? Have you settled with Sharp so that you will not be loser?_ Will you be able to pay him? Sister Catharine wrote to me that you would be in E. Tenn. in Oct. October & wanted to know if we could not all meet there at that time__ For my own part, I have no idea that I shall be able to be there before winter; perhaps not even then. I shall Come as soon as I can, be it soon or late_ But I should like, above all things, to meet the whole family once more around the old fireside__ It would recall to our minds the recollection of by gone days_ it would awaken in our bosoms the remembrance of former times & former associations_ hours which, if they were not hours of perfect happiness, were at least the hours of innocence and youth. I have been very much occupied with my duties since my return to this place_ Capt Captain Ogden has been along the line of the road, putting out Contracts, the whole season_ and is absent at this time._ I have remained here, & have been engaged with the business in this section of the Country, and in corresponding with the departments at Washington , & with the different agents & assistants along the whole line of the Road &c. et cetera &c,_ I have thus far enjoyed uninterrupted good health_ I think I shall leave Edmond at home the first opportunity I have_ He is more plague than profit_ My horse is coming on finely_ I have been endeavoring to read Law this summer, but my other engagements have been such, that I have done little at it. It was with regret that I lately learned the death of Col Standefor _ he died at Kingston on his way to Washington City_

The Crops in this country are the finest that I have ever seen any where__ The country is rather new to be a good fruit country_ apples are pretty good_ peaches are scarce & of an inferior quality._ In point of all acquaintances I stand alone_ there is not an individual in the country whom I have ever known before postmark stamp: Sept. 21, Terre Haute, Ia. 25 Mr. Charles F. Welcker Talladega Alabama This country is not healthy_ Bilious fevers, fevers & agues, &c are quite common__ Give my respects to Capt. shelly & Mr Rutlege , Col Hogan I suppose will not remember me_ Give my love to Caroline, Henry, & Elizabeth, & accept the same from your brother Geo. George L. Welcker To Charles F. Welcker Talladega, Ala. Alabama
