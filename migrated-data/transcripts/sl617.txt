To his Excellency James C Jones Governor of the State of Tennessee We your Memorialists being citizens of the Morgan Cty County & State aforesaid being assembled at the house of Morris Baker on the 23rd May 1842 for the purpose of electing a Dpty Shff Deputy Sheriff . in sd said County and having deliberately reflected on the indebtedness of the people together with the scarcity of money and we believe that the most ruinous consequences must follow if the people continue trying to collect debt off of each other we believe that under existing circumstances thre three fourths of the community will be altogether ruined broke up and by the sacrifice of their property and their debts all remain unpaid. Therefore your memorials request you will the Legislature together as speedily as posable possible for the purpose of establishing some measure that will relave relieve the distresses of the community, we believe that the constitution will not prohibit the people from any the benefits of anything that is equal in its opperation operation & consentive by allowing a majority, and we have reason to think that nine tenths of the citizens of this state would be willing that all private debts should remain unpaid for a time of two years provided that the law did not compel any to pay sooner we believe that one of two things ought to be caried carried into effect to wit stop the execution law for a certain time or have a valuation law say that mans property if sold by a collecting officer shall not be taken from him under two thirds its value, if neither is done we cannot see any way that the people can be relieved by Legislative aid, we therefore hope that you will use all meanes means to have one of these measures caried carried into effect with all posable speade speed
