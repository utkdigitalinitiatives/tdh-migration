Walnut Grove Rutherford Cty County Tennessee April 8th 1835 Dear Charles Here upon this torn Sheet of fools cop I attempt to offer you a few suggestions for your immediate Consideration & action in relation to your partnership Stock of horses as I Should like you to come here immediately and attend to them, I mean it is my opinion that you to do the best for yourself Should come here and take one or more of the Colts as the oldest colt is now of the proper age to be put into market and is in fine order to sell and Father wishes you as you are already interested to have a better bargain and a chance of making more proffit profit off of the Stock than any one anyone else. We must sell off all our Stock of every kind except Such as we can employ Constantly and proffitably profitably , for we have bought a large track of land in Maddison Madison Cty County Mi. Mississippi for the purpose of rasing raising Cotton largely and have already Commenced operations there having Sent all the hands we had on this place to that and we design living there for 8 months in each year. We are to go down in Septr September next. We plant there this year 400 acres of cotton. We will in all probability Sell this plantation Shortly as purchasers; as rather, a quantum sufficit of bidders for it hold their purses in rediness readiness to make the purchase. So you see the reason in part why I urge you to come up here. Again I need hardly advertize advertise you that blooded Stock cannot be properly & raised and located

in the State of Mississippi when each Smaller concern is forced to give place to the more important one of Cotton making. Were you here to see this havock filly Atalanta I then should not find it necessary to Say a word to induse induce you to do that which I am convinced is your high interest, I mean to take Atalanta paying us half the Value of her and keep for breeding or other purposes or perhaps also the whole stock as we are obliged by circumstances to sell out our entire interest in Hood horses and as blooded Stock at this time in this country is abundant and untried will not bring its full value. I must attempt to give you an idea of this filly and that without the gloss of fanciful words and well turned periods, then to say the least her colour color is certainly a beautiful & rich dappled Chestnut Sorrell Sorrel her hair is short Soft and fine her nostril is wide — her eyes are clear glancing and animated, full, large, and far between — her ear long, thin, tapered, and pointed — her neck gently arched and raising beautifuly beautifully from her horizontal Shoulders and deep, full, breast — her back and loin are fine the bone unusually strong — her ribs are rounding — her quarters well turned — her hip bones lay in Close and point to the Shoulder — her limbs are all of the kind proper for beauty strength and action placed well under her and the whole as perfect as you ever saw or ever will see. Now Charles after all this I tell you she would untrained as She is not sell at any rate for more than 350. or 400. perhaps not so much whereas if trained and tried She would bring you from 600. to 1000 or 1300.$ this is a difference worth attending to and if you choose, you know you can come here and live with us when your living

will Cost you nothing and you Can have her trained with or without a partner at a small expense. If you take her now instantly in the time whether you train or sell her again — if any one anyone buys her it will be to train — now is the time to begin the preparatory lessons of breaking exercise and galloping — Colts will not be in demand again or an opportunity of remaining them till next fall a year h?ner — Therefore what you do, do instanter, do decisively , and let me know without fail by the return mail as this is now Friday and next Monday week County Crt Court sits in Nbo? and if an opportunity offers we will sell, (without further advice from you), at that time. Calypso has a colt of this spring by Havock a horse colt sorrell sorrel red marked in the face Similar to the Dame — is about a month old — is a fine colt but I perhaps ought not to say a Superior colt the mare is in good condition and not put to the horse yet So much for horses— The family all are well at this time and would be glad to see you — your little neice niece and nephews would shout at your arrival if they recognized you. I should have written you sooner but that I just returned the day before yesterday from Mi. Mississippi and thereby have given you more leisure in coming; but come any how. That which is equivalent to saying your friend I shall subscribe myself as usual J M Mitchell Chas Charles F Welcker
