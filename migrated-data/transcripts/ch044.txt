You have no doubt been informed of your dismissal from that office. That you may be under no mistake as to this matter, you are also informed the government of the United States does not recognise recognize as its agents the missionaries acting under the direction of the American Board of Foreign Missions. Whatever may have been your conduct in opposing the humane policy of the general government, or exciting the Indians to oppose the jurisdiction of the State,
