Nashville Dcr December 23d -'28 Sir, The presidents message has come to hand & is a State paper of a high order of respectability. I See nothing in it however , but Such information as it was the duty of the president to communicate to Congress except the recomendation recommendation of appropriation for the increase of the Navy; and on which Subject I would have been equally well Satisfied had his wishes been expressed even in Stronger terms. I have been raised a Navy man. My old Father was the Steady and constant friend and Supporter of old John Adams , because, ( & for this reason only, ) what he was boldly infavour in favor of a Navy, and a strong military power, in times of war peace — I mean a regular force — the latter I have ever Consedered Considered as dangerous to republican institutions; but in a Navy it matters not how strong, Can never be dangerous to the liberties of this Republick Republic ; and I humbly concieve conceive that the west — the people of the Vally Valley of Messesseppi Mississippi are as much interested therein as the people of Boston or New York : — Suppose at the commencement of the last war, ( Jany January 1812 , ) the enemy had lost a fleet of forty sail in the mouth of the Messpi. Mississippi and entirely bockaded blockaded the Same, and by being relieved, & Sustaned Sustained continued to do so for ten years; — Continually threatening Norleans New Orleans , and by this theory Kept the upper Country in continual allarm alarm , and a large standing lace quartered there

winter and Summer — Will you Calculate the the the consequences? The Key of terrors appeared in meletary military form, at Durodins & waterloo — Hence too odiously — but let a half a dozen melitia militia armies perish at N. New Orleans with yellow fever, and where can troops be had to supply thier their place? Not on the upper Mississippi — aside from this consideration: a ten years blockade, would ruin the country & produce a revolt to our own Govt Government , unless if I am ⁁ not greatly mistaken — unless Some great anxiety Cause, existed to prevent it. No people on the South for an equal extent of teretory territory , are So delicately situated, Geographically. in times of war with an Enemy commanding a large Naval force, as those of the valley of the Mississippi . Whos often been said to me by the, "Gun Boat " now that no fleet Could during the summer blockade the mouth of the river — Suppose the Island of Cuba , and port of the Havana at the disposal of such enemy; with the power of employing Sailors from the west Indies ? will every man say the blockade could not be sustained ? without Naval opposition? I have so well persuaded myself that this is the most assailable point indirectly ⁁ in the U.S. in terms of war with a Naval enemy, that I think us expense Should deter a western man from Garding Guarding against it — and there is only one Security — a Naval power Sufficently Sufficiently strong to beat the enemy from our shores the coast, : — And hence, I deem a gradual increase of the Navy the undoubted policy of the Western people. I pray your Sir, to take this as it is meant a more scheming upon one of my hobbies — the other is the encouragement of domestick domestic manufacturing I had greatly rather See a direct tax , than see the country clothed from England , France , & the East Indies — and were I in congress I would

vote for an increase of tax upon fine cloths and coarse cotton fabricks fabrics ⁁ imported Our wool is equal to the Spanish; and our cottons above the must find a market at home, if they find any that will Justify growing them. I have some experience in the latter branch of business, and think the common saying, that the South is taxed for the benefit of the North, is mere cant — unnerving cant, for which I never have heard any good reason offered. Last night at 12 oclok o'clock departed this life our friend Judge Staywood , after a fiew few days illness. I think he was 66 He submitted to his fate with great fortitude — rest that Solemn resignation which every man should feel, when biding a dieu bidding adieu to this world . we have abundant crops here and any example within any day. In the way of Genl General matters, we have nothing — literally nothing. with great respect, accept my best wishes Gnl. Jn General John Cocke
