June the 5th 1836 Dear Andrew The races are now over and I have liesure leisure to write you a few lines- I won both my races- The Crusader distanced the feild field the 2nd heat in 2. m minutes 1. s second and could have run 4 miles and repeat at the same tick track heavy I run the Pacific against Gen General Mabry celebrated Leviathan filly a dash of a mile and carried 10 pounds the most weight and a raw inexperienced rider- I got a bad start and ran locked from the first turn until within a hundred yards of the Judges stand. The filly had the track & was good a rider as ever mounted. I beat him about 2 lengths-time 2. m 2. s It was the handsomest and best contested race I ever saw and the time was good- with the same weight that the filly carried and as good a rider my colt could have run it in 1. m 57. s track heavy and several bad mud holes. There was not a man that saw my colt But pronounced him the best Pacific they ever saw and able with equal advantage to beat the Leviathan 50 yards. I have named him Martin Van Buren- The bets were 2 to 1 on the Leviathan until mine made his appearance on the track and then the bets were even-

In relation to your affairs here all is going well at your farm- You have a good crop & it is in good order- Your stock all look well- Your house will now be soon finished- The paper has arrived and the painters are finishing off and papering as fast as they can- But I am sorry to say to you nothing as yet has been done towards the yard. But that can yet be done this summer By reference to the last Union you will see that Carter has been advertised by me I am very uneasy about him I fear you will never get him again if he gets on the Ohio . I am going to town tomorrow and will endeavor to get a man to pursue him. I wish you to write me if you wish Stockly to remain the year out- He is a disagreable disagreeable man- but will have more work done than any one else- He will agree to quit at any time you wish him- Cousin Daniel and Lady and family has arrived and will remain here the summer out. When shall we expect you and sister Emily & family. Give our love to all and believe me sincerely yours Stockly Donelson
