Columbia Female Institute April 1st 1841 Dearest Mother You have I know my dear ⁁ Mother sufficient reason to reproach me for my silence I have no excuse to offer to you, but I promise you that I shall be write more regularly hereafter. I received your very afft. affectionate letter a day or two since. You do not know how much pleasure it gave me to receive it. If I could receive such letters as that is every week I should be almost happy . I also received a very kind and interesting letter from Uncle Will . I need not say how much I was pleased with it. I am very happy to hear that Aunt Patsy is recovering her health so fast. I hope that she will be so well that her & Uncle can come up to my Examination. Tell Aunt Narcissa I wish very much to be at home so that I could go a fishing with for we always have so much pleasure. Why does she not write to me? I shall look for a letter from her next week — if I do not receive it shall be very much disappointed — I have been very buisily busily engaged for the last two weeks in writing my French exercises — we have six or eight to write every

evening — I am very much pleased with the study of French. I was very much astonished, I must confess at hearing of so many marriages, I had no idea that Miss McIver was going to be married — but "strange things will happen sometimes." Mamma you need not be uneasy about my clothes, for I have as many as I have any use for, though I am very glad that you intend sending me a dress, for scarcely any of mine will suit the weather. I want to purchase a Calico dress — but thought I would wait until you would tell what kind I had better get. all my dresses that I have are too short waisted — If you have any made please have them longer in in in that respect only. I do not think that I have grown any in height. Mamma you made an earnest request of me in your last letter, that I would not ride on horse back until I see you. I will promise you that I will not . I have discontinued my riding lessons, and have taken Embroidery in the place of it — I like to take it very much. the most pleasant evening that I have spent since I have been here was in the Embroidery room. I am very glad to hear that Sis was pleased with her Pants. O! how much I should like to see our little Walking and almost talking brother Sam . I know that he looks very sweet You must let him know that he has such a sister as I am. it would please me very much if would learn to call my name. You excuse this very short letter. but as it is the 1st day of April — & most of the girls are writing April fools I concluded that I would have much more pleasure in writing to you, so you see that I have no time to writin writing any more. Give my love to Papa & all my relations kiss the children for. Tell Mary Ormand that I want to see her very much. your afft. affectionate & obedient daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester

The recolects recollects to Aunt Narcissa perfectly: Every person is very anxious for Aunt N Narcissa to come up to the Examination. Mamma dont you think that Mrs Polk was a very long time in coming to see me?

You and all the children must be sure to come up at the examination. The letters have just arrived & I have received a very interesting letter from brother John & Robert . I shall it in a few days. I need not say how much pleasure gave me. Remmember Remember me afft. affectionately to all the servants. Farewell my dear Mother . 1st day of April — — — —
