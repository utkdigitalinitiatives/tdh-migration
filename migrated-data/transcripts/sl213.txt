Nashville April 21, 1833 Dear Mother I received your welcome letter by Mr Moose which gave me a good deal satisfaction to hear from you and my brothers and dear sister. you wrighted wrote to me that Br Brother James is trying to edued educate himself tell him to press on with redoubled diligene diligence that with a good educatian education and a good character he can face the frowns & curses of this wicked world that he can stand as bold and damnless before the wicked decivr deceiver as a lyon lion doth before his prey My dear Mother I am poore poor but I feel myself as independent Boneypart Bonaparte did. I have often wished that I was a poet or some eloquent wrighter writer that I might paint the innumerable shades which present themselfes themselves before my mind on this subject but perhaps I ame am taking up too much paper and time on this subject. Let me speak of something else. You say I am making rapid stride to manhood yes I am know now in my 18th year and all I wish and all I crave is a good educatian education and a sure and true relyance reliance on the infinate infinite and almyghty Being. Then will I defy the devil yea then will I defy world to slap my prizes to the summit of fame glory. Oh that I could see my brothers

But after all I should I shoul be sill still more gatrfyed gratified to see them become Releigous Religious . Br Brother an and myself are well and we expec t to see you in May One of young men has left us and there is but thee three of us know now Br Mr Batenead and I and we are very busy. B Wells speaks of getting another soon.â€” You spoke of the cholera and scalett feve scarlet fever in you letter but there is little? here. Nashville is very healthy and I think if ther there is no more sickness then now the Drs Doctors will will have to beg ther their bread or live on the capital There has been too two men murdered in Nashville lately and they have one of the murderes murderers in goal jail awaiting his tyral trial which comes on the first of May Its very likely he will be hung as the proof is very evident. There is a good del deal of of excitement in town to day. The geat great Methodist pecher preacher Naphat arrive yesterday and I expect the church will be ? We hear him preach I must bring my letter to a close Mortimer sends his hardest love and best respects to you Brs Brothers and sister give my respects to all my acquaintances
