Columbus Mcminn Cty. E. Tenn. County East Tennessee August 2nd 1834 .— Dear Brother; I take my pen to give you a short narration of the most important particulars respecting myself since I left home (which was april 16th ) together with a brief statement of the circumstances under which I left there — During my stay at home last winter father would not let me know certainly whether or not I could return to College; and thereby kept me in suspense until the 15th April , at which time he commenced a quarrel with an individual, upon whom he is accustomed to lay violent hands on every whimsical occasion; and would have injured her had it not been for my interference he being sober.— Shortly after on returning to the house, he expressed a desire of my departure and absence from home, going away at the same time with a view to its effectuation, and saying the would continue absent two days; whereupon I made the necessary preparations for parting, and went by stage the ensueing ensuing day to Knoxville . — After learning through the private inquiry of some of my friends, that no

suitable employment could be had in that place, I went to S. Inmans , Dandridge , where I learned that he was in Baltimore ; and that it was probable he would employ some person on his return. — Now with the view to ascertain this I endeavoured endeavored to settle the Jefferson affair, and succeeded in geting getting uncles John & Jeremiah to execute to father their note payable, Janary January next, which I left with Heinds , and in getting them to promise to pay your 1.00 at the following county Court, to be given over to Heinds agreeably to my instructions; then I return to Knoxville with the view of going to where you are, provided S. Inmans did not inform me by letter that he would give me employment. — While in Knoxville I was informed that Wm William Dickson of Greenville wished to employ 2 Clerks; upon receipt of this I procured an introductory letter from Etheldrec Williams to him; not getting any other as Mr. D Dickson is a very enthusiastic anti— Jackson man. — on arrival there he said he could not employ any person before three months, in consequence of his having thrown down a part of his house with the view of making an addition to it. — On my way I saw Inman but could make no reasonable arrangements with him. — In Greenville I learned from Joseph S. Chunn whose residence is at the mouth of Chucky that his father in Asheville

Col. Colonel Chunn of Asheville N. North Carolina , certainly wanted a Clerk, either to Continue in Asheville or to go to the Creek Country; then directing my course towards Asheville on a horse furnished by J. S. Chunn I received employment upon the following conditions (viz) " To continue together for 2 years probably, longer if it suited, and shorten at the options of either party; for which $75. is to be given for the first year 175 for the second and perhaps, though at the option of Chunn 100 for the first and 200 for second. — Then one of Col. Colonel Chunn's sons and myself went to Augustia Augusta to receive about 8,000 worth of goods, convoyed up the Savanah Savannah from the East , understanding that I was to see them safely delivered at Jackson Ala. Alabama — I went on horse back to Jacksonville, , and then turned back to meet the waggons wagons to direct them on to Cassville Geo. Georgia , which is about 100 miles So South of Athens Ten Tennessee ; when after Samuel L. Chunn , who was in partnership with Wm. William Gillespie of Rhea cty county & Dr. Patton , who is a son in law of Col. Colonel Chunns, and myself had put up the goods, I came on with Dr. Patton here to his residence with the view of attending to his country store. — Whether I shall attend here at Asheville N. North Carolina or at Cassville Geo. Georgia I cannot tell untill until sept september , at which time Col. Colonel Chunn will be here. — All of this family are very wealthy and respectable, and appear to be agreeable. — We did not enter into writing, but will settle yearly.
