Ross Landing Tn Tennessee Jany January . 28 1839 To his Excellency Gov Governor . Cannon, Dear Sir, Two of the commissioners of the Western & Atlantic Rail Road of Georgia arrived at this place on yesterday, having come out with a view of locating the terminus of that Road on the Tennessee river .__ The legislature of this state has, as I understand by resolution or otherwise, directed them to elect the terminus with reference to the most direct connexion conection practicable with the West generally, but particularly with West Tennessee __ This is so obviously the interest of Georgia as well as of Tennessee, that explorations and recoginozances recognizances for a short distance west of the river were thought advisable by the commissioners to asertain ascertain the most eligible route for a prolongation of the improvement.__ The privilege granted by Tennessee to Georgia for surveys, construction of roads &c and et cetera only extends to the Eastern margin of the river,__ and the commrs commissioners have not felt authorised authorized to cross the river, without some intimation from the executive of our states that it would not be regarded as an intrusion.__ The two who are here, have been brought out an engineer with them for the purpose indicated; but meeting here with an apparently semi official paragraph in a late member of the Nashville Whig on the subject. they seem to understand from it that Tennessee knows and

cares but little about their enterprize__ and above all that their grand object of connecting the Atlantic with the valley of the mississippi by as direct a communication as possible is likely to receive but little consideration or encouragement in Tennessee__ If the river instead of a railway, is to be relied on as affording the means of a permanent connection it is obviously proper that the Rail Road, by Georgia or Tennessee, be contained down below the Suck & Boiling Pot from where there is uninterrupted steam Boat navigation at almost all stages of water to the head of the muscle shoals .__ Such a continuation, if no other be thought of; cannot be made without crossing the river above the obstructions, and Georgia is anxious to terminate her road with a view to this continuation at least.__ Her commissioners, I am persuaded, feel that their proposition to make an examination west of the river, has been declined by the authorities of Tennessee, and in consequence of it, not being able to carry out the views of their state satisfactorily, they have determined to return without making any examination or location.__ I know they feel somewhat mortified at the seeming indifference of Tennessee on this subject as manifested in your views as given in the paragraph above alluded to, and knowing that they misunderstood the matter, (and of which I have endeavoured to satisfy them) and that you in common with a large portion of our state must

feel the liveliest interest in the construction of this great work, I take the liberty of informing you of what has transpired that you may treat the subject as you may think most advisable under the circumstances.__ The commissioners & engineer will leave this place early tomorrow morning for Georgia and I have no doubt but that the tone if your communication to them will determine the question whether they will cross the line of Tennessee at all with their improvement; at least for the present.__ Very respectfully Your obt. Servt obedient servant . James A. Whiteside
