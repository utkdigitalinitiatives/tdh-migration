Nashville June 11th 1802 Sir , Since the setting of Davidson Court I received your letter relative to the opening of the Natchez road. agreeably thereto, the subject was brought before last Williamson County Court. An order was then and there made for a jury to view a road the nearest and best was from Franklin to the Davidson County line in the direction to Nashville , and also order for a jury to view a road the nearest and best way from Franklin to the Natchez road cut by the troops of the United States , where the Indian Boundary line intersects the same or to the North of that point. A motion was made at the same court to procure an order for a view of a road from where the Natchez road intersects the Indian boundary line, the nearest and best way towards Nashville to the Davidson County line, but the court unanimously opposed it. Because they said there was now a reduction of the army, and they had received information that the troops were ordered to cease cutting the Natchez road any further; and then said that road would be an intolerable burthen burden on the citizens of the said County without any benefit, for it would pass thou through a County very thinly

Page 2

settled and that said road would not pass thro through Franklin and would be against the interest of said Town and its vicinity which they thought they ought to promote; and this last reason appeared to be the only actuating one; the others were ostensible . it had such weight that it was mentioned by by several and not denied by any that even if the United States troops were to cut said road they ought not to permit them If said order had been obtained in Williamson there would I believe have been no difficulty in obtaing obtaining an order from the County Court of Davidson for a road from Nashville the nearest way and best way to the Davidson County line in the direction to the intersection of the Natchez road and the Indian boundary And thereby said viewers viewing said road and marking it in concert with Col Colonel . Butler , the object of the secretary at war might be obtained to wit. the having a road opened the nearest and best way from Nashville to Natchez . But now Col Colonel Butler

Page 3

declines to open the road from Nashville agreeably to the order of view of Williamson court alledging alleging that it does not accord with the letter spirit nor intent of the order of the secretary at war unclear for he says the road the nearest and best way from Nashville to Natchez road now opened at the Indian boundary would be four miles nearer than any road which could be cut passing through Franklin to the same places Said road will be of much importance to the citizens of Meroe generally and to travelers travellers to and from Natchez but unless exertions are used, we shall be deprived of the benifit benefit of it by the local policy of the County of Williamson ; the town of Franklin and it vicinity, and the narrow interested views of a few individuals. Suffer me to suggest to the consideration of your excellency whether there would not be a propriety in writing to the County court of Williamson and Davidson , to make such order as would enable Col Colonel . Butler to cut out said road agreeably to the orders of the secretary at war

Page 4

Or to write to the secretary at war to permit Col Colonel . Butler to cut said road according to his discretion from Nashville to where it is already open at the Indian boundary having first obtained permission of the owners of the lands through which it may pass: and permission of your excellency. Or that the secretary will permit Col Colonel . Butler to open such road from Nashville to the intersection of the Natchez road and the Indian boundary line as the county Court of Davidson and Williamson may respectively direct. I have not a copy by me of the above mentioned order of Williamson County Court. it is merely recited from memory and possibly may not be altogether correct. It is the earnest desire of most of the respectable characters in this district that said road should be opened; and I am confident if it could

Page 5

be obtained through the intervention of your excellency with the secretary at war, or with the County courts of Davidson and Williamson your regard for the interest of this District would be great ful ly remembered. Possibly the most eligible way of effecting it might be by your giving permission immediately to the troops to open away agreeably to the orders of secretary at war with the consent of the County Courts of Davidson Williamson and with the consent of ye respective owners of the lands, through, which it may pass. And at the same time to provide against the possibility of the courts and individuals not giving said consent, to write to the secretary to permit the said way to be opened as the County courts of Davidson and Williamson may respectfully order. 1st Gov. Governor to write to County courts of Davidson Williamson to permit the U.S. to open the road according to orders 2. to write to secretary at war to permit troops to cut the road according to wish of Davidson Williamson , and if they are unwilling to make order 3. Thin Then , to permit the troops to cut the road with permission of the owners of the lands through which it passes. 4th. Then to permit the troops to cut the road with the permission of the County Courts and of the unclear owners of the lands I have got a young man who sits with me to throw three unc together I have been sick nearly three weeks and am not now able to sit up long The unc are not commenced up I could wish The road is of great consequence; and unless an order is obtained from the secretary of war to open it by Franklin . The troops

Page 6

will be withdrawn, and the road lost for it would be difficult to get the consent of the owners of land not in the Country Col Colonel Butler says an order must be got from the Secretary of War, or he can't do it As an individual let me intreat you to indeavour endeavor to get the order of the secretary of War to open by Franklin , by immediate representation I believe Col Colonel Butler expects such an application will be made I am exhausted with great resp respects I am yr mo obs your most obedient servant Jim John Overton Gov Governor Roane
