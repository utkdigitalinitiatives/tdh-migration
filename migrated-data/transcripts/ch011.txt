I will communicate the its contents to the Honl Honorable Secy Secretary of War by next mail, who, I have no doubt will adopt the most efficent efficient Course, of which you shall obtain the earliest information I had entertained high expectations that the severity of the measures inforced enforced by Col. Turk Turk would have had a more lasting impression, and at least have restrained them one year from the repetision repetition of their old offences, but, I now entertain doubts whether the presence of the Sub Agent or any other Person, will be Sufficent Sufficient to restrain so numerous a band of out lawed men in the absence of an armed force from, violating the laws treaties of the Government. I am very respectfully your obd. obedient Sevt Servant Jos. Joseph McMinn Mr Charles R. Hicks Head chief of the Cherokee Nation
