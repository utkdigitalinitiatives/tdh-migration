Beauport 23d June 1813 Sir Permit me to communicate to your Excellency my serious apprehensions for the health of the United States prisoners of war on board ship off Quebec . Between two and three hundred man crowded together in one vessel in the heat of summer I fear will produce diseases which in all reasonable probability will carry off many of them; The health and lives of men which the fortune of war hath placed in your Excellencys Excellencies sovern I am persuaded will be regarded with humanity and kindness and that it is only necessary for me to name their circumstance ; personal situation to have It their situation changed for the better, It would be very desirable that they should be sent to the United States on parole as others have been. but if that cannot be obtained, I take the liberty to ask for them to be landed and confined in some airy building during the summer months; or encamped in this Parish convenient to their officers quarters so that I could cause their names to be caled called two or three times a day His Excellncy Excellency Genl General Sir George Prevost
