Nashville 13th Apl April 1823 Dear Sir; upon consultation with Maj Major Hockley we think it the safest and most advisable course to send Lewis with our Horse direct to Memphis __ There are Several objections to the other rout route we think it very doubtfull doubtful whether Lewis coud could cross Forked Deer at Rutherford _ but a still greater difficulty is to get a passage up to the mouth of the Forked Deer__ the maj informs me that the boats uniformly pass on the opposite side from memphis and if it was otherwise no boat will come too for one or two passengers he [unclear] frequently tried when he was at the Bluffs & every attempt failed__ this being the case we might be delays two weeks at the Bluffs and then not get a passage up_ To make certain, let Lewis go direct with our horse to the Bluffs,__ I can direct him a rout that he can get there without any difficulty__ which is to cross at Jackson __ Hatcha at Polks ferry and from there the new road direct to Memphis_ crossing wolf at the Horse ford where there is a ferry_ there is no difficulty at any stage of water this rout it is about 30 miles out of the way_ Say whether we shall adopt this rout.__ Your friend Jno John C McLemore P.S. Post Script This arrangement nu you as you can make an arrangement with the cass of the Nashville to stop on his return or can wait for some boat which may leave cargo at memphis_ if you can get a passage up Lewis can return with me to Rutherford with your horse___ J.C.M John C. McLemore the will leave here on wednesday morning certain___
