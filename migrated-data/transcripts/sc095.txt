Washington City April 20th 1830 Dear Sir , I had the pleasure a few days since of receiving your favour favor of the 9th instant, and was not a little astonished to hear that you had recd received only two letters from me during the present session, for I have written you more than twice that number. I regret, exceedingly, the unfortunate misunderstanding which has taken place between the Ramsey's and their connections, and Mr Mister . Churchwell. I am unable from your account of the matter to see, why any unpleasant feelings should have been felt on the occasion in the first instance- I apprehend it is as you conjecture, for future opperations operations . I can give you but little information of a political character, that is new. The white cause is every day gaining ground, and will continue to do so I hope until he shall reach the presidency. It is well for you and the nation to know that the present elections in virginia are no teste test as to the presidential election- The question now is in Virginia the right of instruction- It is not probable that congress will adjourn before the middle of June, indeed it cannot and do the business of the country, which it is absolutely necessary to be done-

In a political point of view, I am of opinion that the country is not injured by congress remaining yet a little longer in session, and have the corrupt actings and doings of the governed probed to the bottom-Our cause, I mean the cause of the country, will lose nothing by investigation.- I have heard of William Park and the Young Ladies being at Philadelphia - It is expected they will return this way-Judge Whits & lady are in good health and spirits-my respects to Mrs Misses Park and family- will thank you for a line at any time- I am with great respect your friend & obt obedient Srvt Servant Luke Lea James Park Esqr. Esquire P.S. The Senate have not yet acted on the Cherokee Treaty-what its decision will be no one can tell as all their proceedings remain yet a secret- L.L.
