Charity Hall, Chickasaw Nation , Jan. January 10th 1826 . Rev. Reverend & Dear Brother, A few days after my return from the synod, on the 9th of November , I resum'd resumed teaching school, nearly all the schollars scholars who were at school last year have come on to school, and the rest are expected, The school will be compos'd composed of the same schollars this year that it was last. Their progress has been retarded by the long vacation, but not as much as I fear'd feared it would, They are now advancing, and I hope some of them will finish their course this year As they were nearly all barefooted, I have set the largest of them at making shoes for themselves, and also for the smaller boys, They perform exceedingly well, I want them shod to prepare ground early for the ensuing crop. ____ The liberallity liberality of the patrons of this Institution, manifested on the last year, The Unanimous interest the members of the Board appeared to feel in its success, at their last meeting. and the Judicious plan adopted by them for the purpose of raising funds this year, for its support, and to meet the arrearages, encourages a hope, that after this year, those painful embarrassments, so oppressive to our feelings for the want of friends to defray the expense of the school will be removed, and the Institution will gain that credit & respectability, which
