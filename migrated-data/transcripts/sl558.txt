Cantonment near Nashville 1st September 1812 Sir Your communications of the 12th & 14th of last month are both before me. This mornings report furnishes 268 recruits at this place Harman has enlisted 25 more at warren Ct Court house and is on his way here with them, Captain Armstrong has left Knoxville with 40 some odd and Lieut Lieutenent Stephens recruits with him there Add all these together and we will have upwards of 350 soldiers of the new army in West Tennessee . Captain Gray s company is complete and Capt Captain Desha s will be so shortly; for he has now eighty some odd men in it. I have had yesterday a General Muster & shall discharge four a five to day or tomorrow, who are unfit for service. The soldier who I wrote you was dangerously ill has since died. This was owing to the bad management of our physician or Surgeons mate Carlisle Humphreys , who I have freely permitted to cross the mountains and most sincerely wish he may never join the regiment again. He is not at all qualified for the business he is in and would if suffered to practice upon the regiment soon kill the whole of us. With respect to cloathing clothing , arms, camp equipage &c etcetera I have surely said enough__ If I have gone two far, the General will pardon me. I send herewith Captain Deshas recruiting and contingent

Lieut Kingsly has been enabled since his men have put on fine coats to add at least a dozen to his list of recruits The copy of my two receipts per 1000$ are received and I am thankful to the General for the trouble he has taken to forward them. I have the honor to enclose a list of officers of the regiment under my command as arranged by the Inspector General and transmitted to me by the adjutant Genl. General I have too pursuant to this information proceeded to the arrangement of the officers to companies in the manner
