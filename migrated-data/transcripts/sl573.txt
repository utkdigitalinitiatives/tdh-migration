Bellview 9th Jany January 1822 Dear Genl General Your Kind letter of the 4th ult ultimo was recd received some time ago. It is with much pleasure I hear of the continued health,& prosperity of a long tried friend_ & one too who has been well proved & found sound to the core. reciprocal & well confirmed friendship, is one of the highest enjoyments experienced in social life. How pleasant to have a friend to whom we can on all occasions unbosom our whole heart. The Presidents message at the meeting of the 17th congress, is less Interesting than any of the Kind which I have seen this I suppose is owing to the steady & unterrupted state of our national affairs. However that of our commercial relations with France is an exception The extent of this evil I suppose not to be great, as it respects a partial part of our commerce only. The complaint of France about the apollo , and their rights at New orleans , appear to have so little foundation that she will not (I think) sincerely urge them. As was to have been expected the P has touched the Florida dispute with a sparing & tender hand. This notwithstanding, it is probable from the character, & peculiar

standing of one of the actors in that Dramma Drama And from the inordinate thirst our congress people have to talk, that much of the time of that body will be wasted on this subject. It is true as you say that much of the time of our Legislature is employed in attending to little, local concerns. This to a reasonable extent is right,_ but it is induly unduly to the neglect of the primary Interest of the common wealth. How this evil is to be remidied remedied , in the present ignorant, & vitiated state of society I Know not For in the choice of men to represent us in that body, we see that merit in the estimation of the Electors, is but a minor consideration. Hence untill we become more wise & more virtuous, we shall in this respect be no better off. It appears to me, that all the other states so far as my information goes, are improving. But poor Tennessee, is retrograding or at best stationary. I take no pleasure in entertaining this opinion of the country which I love above all others. And it is this high regard I have for my state, which makes me feel, so pungently on the occasion. Are reforms hopeless? cannot the old leaven be purged out? And cannot the people be brought to see their best Interest? I have sometimes thought that attempts of this kind would be vain. But from

the great importance of the occasion, anoth and effort ought to be made. Let the wise & the good, unite their energies, to desire & carry into effect, some ways & means to better our condition. I think it practicable, and it would be honorable at least, to make the attempt. And if you & I, from the wear of many years m shd should not live to see and enjoy the benefits Our offspring may. The Books and papers of the commissioners office, of 1807 were by act of assembly delivered over to the Regester Register of the Land office where they remained untill the setting of the last Genl assembly, which an act passed directing that they shd be delivered to the possession of the present bord board . whether they are delivered to the clerk, or whether they will not be delivered untill the board meets- ( 1st april ) I know not. at any rate you can get the paper you speak of, by applying to Mr Blackfan , if delivered, and if not, to Mr McGavock . Our family is in usual health. my own is very good with the exception of a cronick chronic complaint with which I have had to conflict many years. with sincere regard I am your friend____ Wm William Martin
