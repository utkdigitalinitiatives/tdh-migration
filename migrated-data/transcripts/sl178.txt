November 14th 1830 Dear Father I take the present oportunity opportunity of informing you that we are all well. I have seen Joshua to day he and family are well, brother Franklin & wife were here last wee week & were well, their litle little boy grows finely & is a very fine child, I was at brother John s some five or six weeks since they were also well, tho though there has been considerable sickness in Tipton this year, Nancy es sister, Mrs Small dyed died a day or two before I was there I was much astonished some time ago to learn that Joseph had started on a trading expedition on the missippi Mississippi River but to what point he is steering I am not able to learn, only that he has gone down stream I had made an arrangement to go into the mercantil buisiness mercantile business , partly for his benefit or rather I have agreed with Col Colonel Keyes to go into the buisiness at his suggestions, that if I would take Edwin Estes in he would assist us in geting getting every thing we wanted & on such terms as I could meet the payments

after being advised of my means he thought them sufficient to begin with; after maturely considering the subject I conclooded concluded I would try it & wish Estes to come out and agreed with him that he Joseph & myself should go into the buisiness, but before Estes left this I learned Joseph had gone below, I have got John to wright write to such place as he may think most likely to interrest interest him requesting him to return, but whither whether he will return or not is quite uncertain, he has much shaken my confidence lately by his wil l d & wandering calculations I should not have ⁁ made any such arrangements but for a wish to gratify him in his wishes to be in that kind of buisiness, still my opinion of Joseph is that he would not be competent to manage a concern alone, his great desire to sell would allway always lead him into losses & difficultys difficulties , but combinding combining Estes who is said to be steady, & having been twelve years in buisiness & very cautious would I think mak make a safe concern my means are about not very good tho Col Keys thought them sufficient, I have about seven thousand dollars due me within this & the next year all good debts, out

of which I shall have to appropriate about fifteen hundred to the payment of my present contracts leaving a balance of 6500 but the Col says if I can rais raise 3000 it will be sufficient to keep up the stock you perhaps may haver heard of my purchase of a tavern establishment in Jackson , but maynot may not be correctly informed I have bought the half of the establishment, the brick hous house & lot for the sum of $2000 my portion is to keep the hous & pay half of the expense I the other half & divide profits equaly equally the payments are to be paid one fourth when we get possession, the balance in installments for three years, after the 1st payment we ex to make the balance off of the hous; the present incumbent has paid $500 a year rent, and made over 5000 clear of all expense in less than three years, so that if we manage it well it must be good stock, I have been offered the cash in hand for it — my stage contract is better than I expected it as to money received from pasingers passengers ; it has heretofore been agreatdeel a great deal of trouble but we have recently divided the line, it is now very litle trouble, I have the part from Jackson to Bolivar our new hous is nearly completed & we have moved into it
