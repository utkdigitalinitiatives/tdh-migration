Lebanon April 4 1828 Mr Furguson Fergusson A letter has been placed in the hands of the Faculty written by your son William, to a gentleman in Alabama who had two daughters in the Female Academy. It was found to contain several notoriously false and highly slanderous statements respecting new J. N. Roach , late principal of said school, and a young Lady who has taught music in the School An investigation was made when it appeared that rumors were in circulation in certain quarters charging, in substance, what was stated in the letter, to have transpired you son was therefore acquited acquitted of fabricating the false statements, but was convicted of having taken up idle and slanderous rumors and retailed them, not as rumors, but as facts He was also found guilty of imprudent officiousness in communicating these slanderous reports to a stranger and an old gentleman whith with whom he had no acquaintance. As an explanation of this strange officiousness it was ascertained that your son had made his address to one of the young ladies in the School who was boarding with Mr Roach

The Faculty decided that I should community communicate to you all the facts of the case, that you might join with the Faculty in giving your son such advice and admonition as you might deem proper. Also that I should publicly admonish your son, commenting upon the highly misurable conduct of detailing rumors in the form of facts; the imprudent officiousness of addressing a stranger and an aged man upon such subjects; and the ridiculousness of his fancied relation to the young lady The admonition was administered on saturday, and I have now given you the details of the case, which consummates the award of the Faculty In justice to your son I will inform you that his general department has hitherto been creditable to him, with the exception of his gallantry which must be regarded as ridiculous in one of his age. As his Dulcena has left for Alabama, it is hoped that his days of gallantry are over for a time at least, and a little parental advice just at this juncture may be profitable Very respectfully T. C. Anderson
