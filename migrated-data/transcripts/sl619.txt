STATE OF NEW-YORK IN ASSEMBLY, April 8, 1842 Resolved, As the sense of this Legislature, that the franking privilege tolerated by the post-office law of the United States , is a monopoly unsuited to the spirit of the age, subject to enormous abuses, and an unreasonable burden to the few letter correspondents that bear the principal expense of the establishment, and ought to be abolished. Resolved, That for the purpose of diminishing the burdens of correspondents, increasing the revenues of the post-office establishment, and restoring the community, rich and poor, to an equal participation in its benefits, letter postage ought to be greatly reduced, and the disparity between the charge of letters and other matter carried in the mail corrected. Resolved, (if the honorable Senate concur herein,) That our representatives and senators in Congress, be respectfully requested to use their best endeavors to procure a reform in the post-office laws based on the above views. Resolved, That the Executive of this State be respectfully requested to transmit copies of the foregoing resolutions and report, to the senators and representatives of this State, in Congress, and also to the Executives of our sister States, with a view to their being laid before their respective legislative bodies. By order, J.O. Cole, Clerk. STATE OF NEW-YORK . IN SENATE April 9, 1842 Resolved, That the Senate do concur in the said resolutions. By order, I.R. ELWOOD, Clerk.
