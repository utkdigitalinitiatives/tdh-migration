place Meridian Springs Mississippi Mar March 5th 1846 G W George Washington House Esqr Esquire Dr. Dear Sir. Mrs Ross & myself have had the pleasure of spending a day or two with your Lady, at Dr. Morgan 's, ( Jackson ) She was kind enough, to drop Mrs. Ross a note, informing her of her arrival, and with pleasure, & satisfaction, we availed ourselves of the first oppertunity opportunity , to visit her, and were gratified to find her in the enjoyment of fine health, & spirits; and that sweet little daughter, Sally, was as active & lively as a cricket, industriously engaged, in nursing her dolls & running from room to room, apparently, conscious of her own sweetness & activity. The Doctr Doctor & family were well & the citizens of Jackson also. I intended to have written you long since, but have been so engaged in business, when my health would admit permit , since we returned home, that I have not done one half of what I should have done, in the way of letter writing. In relation to your Pile Ointment, I must say, I believe it will cure any ordinary case of piles, if used agreeably to the directions, but mine have been of so long standing, I doubt a permanent cure being affected, yet I have derived great benefit from the use of your ointment, more, far more, than from any prepartion preparation I have ⁁ ever used, & I believe I have used every preparation, I ever heard of, commencing at last Sixteen years ago. — I consider your Pills inferior to none. That I have tried, & think they are bound to do well, wherever they ⁁ are known — I wish you great success in your business, hoping it may be profitable to you, & beneficail beneficial ⁁ to mankind. —

Mr. House, I believe I mentioned to you that my Stepson, A. Fort, had a considerable amount of money, at least $4500 when he left home; — well sir, I have never been able to trace it up, I can not find any thing among his paper showing what he done with it. He told his friends in Ky. Kentucky that his money was in Nashville, but ⁁ did not say in ⁁ whose hands he had placed it, I thought it likely he had deposited it in Bank, & got a friend from Clarksville to inquire, he could learn nothing whatever in relation to; I have since thought, he may possibly have left it with some individual, who may have forgotten it, I am at a loss to conjecture what has become of it.— I must think it is in Nashville somewhere. — I therefore have concluded to get you if you please to make some, & such, inquiry, as you may think most likely to succeed; it is a good deal of money to loose these hard times; & trust it may yet be obtained. you will greatly oblige Mrs. Ross by attending to this request. Mrs. Ross desires to be remembered, in the warmest terms, to Mrs. Hamilton , & is sadly disappointed in not having her company this winter in Mi. — Tell her she must come down as soon as she can. — We all remember her, & the whole family with pleasure, & desire to be presented to all with sentiments of esteem high regards, yourself particularly included. My Dear Sir, accept my best wishes for your health, prosperity & happiness y. f. truly Wm. William B. Ross
