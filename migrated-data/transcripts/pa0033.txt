Highwassee Garrison 5th May 1814 Sir. I herewith transmit a statement of claims of Cherokees who respectfully ask for indemnity for losses suffered by the wanton maraudings & depredations of the Tennessee levies on their marches & countermarches through the Cherokee County in the late expeditions against the Creeks : said to be all done by the left wing or division of those levies._ There has been no complaint of the conduct of the right wing of the army or the 39th Infantry Commanded by Colo. Colonel Williams . In the large detailed statement now transmitted the kinds of property lost by each claimant is described opposite to his name & no. number _ & supported by his narative narrative as taken by a faithfull faithful intelligent Interpretor Interpreter : from the large statement I have made an abstract that the whole may be seen at one view. These depredations may at first seem incredible: but I have no dout doubt of the justness of the statements: they are well known to thousands. I received a letter from an officer of high rank in that army in which he says, "The return of the horse through their Country has been marked by the plunder and prodigal unnecessary and wanton destruction of property: their stock of cattle & hogs have been shot and suffered to rot untouched_ their horses in some instances shared the same fate, their cloathing intened clothing intended to defend them from the wet & cold in the present campaign has been stolen and in some instances where they remonstrated their lives have been threatened,

this conduct is well calculated to dishearten & may withhold their services which would be sincerely felt by us." I have been well informed that when in some instances applications were made by the Indians to officers they received for answer that their men felt themselves unfettered by the laws & that they could not restrain them. The task of Genl. General Jackson to break down the spirit of licentiousness & insubordination of such men & turn the current of barbarity against the Creeks has been done by a kind of address and unconquerable resolution united rarely to be found & the successful termination of the Creek war aught, perhaps, to spread a veil over every vice & every expense in the prosecution of such a war since it is now impossible to place the expence expence on the individuals who committed those excesses. some of the Cherokees have been deprived of all their Cattle & hogs, others nearly all. The Cherokees chearfully supplyed cheerfully supplied the army with Beef & pork and nearly all the corn they had. General Jackson wrote me that on his route south of the mountains with the right wing or division of the army that the Indian let him have all their corn. The Cherokee warriors have faught fought and bled freely and according to their numbers have lost more men than any part of the army. they know that they have rendered great services in this Creek war and have no dout their services are properly appreciated by the Government. They are a little uneasy about the intrusion on their lands but believe the intruders will be removed as soon as troops can be spared for this part of the country: for they confide

in the Government they know their standing. There are people who regret that the Cherokees have taken arms in our favor they would rejoice to have some pretext to drive them off their lands- I have the honor to be with great respect your obedient servt. servant General Armstrong Secretary of War.
