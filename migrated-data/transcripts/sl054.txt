My dear Sir I thank you kindly for the perusal of Judge Overtons very interesting letter. It has afforded me a richer intellectual report than I have for a long time enjoyed, & I have no hesitation in saying, that I have never read a production of the kind, containing so many deep , profitable & parching truths. The marked partiality

which you have always evinced for him was sufficient to encite incite my respect & esteem, but I owe it to ?? to say , that the patriotic and profoundly intelligent vices, upon public questions of intense interest, which it exhibits, have greatly increased my admiration of his character. What has hitherto ⁁ mainly rested upon the favourable favorable opinion of an early & warm hearted friend in which much of individual partiality was to be expected, now reposes an evidence of deep thought, great intelligence

and fervent patriotism, in regard to White There can be no mistake. How fortunate you are in having, & in having had , such a friend — Would to God that the race of such men could be preserved from the wreck of degeneracy & made perpetual. Yours truly M Martin Van Buren Jany January 11 1830 The President
