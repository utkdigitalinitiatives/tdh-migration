I hope that you, and the white men that travelgo into their countrythat land will always advise them people for their goodI cant as yet find out what person it was that killed the indian near Clinch, neither has the indian ever been found, which appears to me very strange; The people who lives near the place says, that they are sure no person among them killed the indian, for if they had, they could have found it out, and  also have found the indian; and it is generally believed that he has been lost in some way that no body can account for. If he has been Killed by any white man and It known who the person will surely be hanged.You may tell my red brothen that my heart is tender towards them, that Imy wishis for them to do well & them well, & shall always be happy to hear of their welfare, And happinessI am with respect & esteem  your Mo.
