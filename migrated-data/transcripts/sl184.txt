Randolph Oct. 18th 1844 Col. Jas. Colonel Joseph Brown Dear Sir A few days since I received the painful inteligence intelligence of the death of your son Joseph P. Brown who died at Galveston Texas with the yellow fever on the 30th July after an illness of nine days. his wife two of his children and all of his servants were down with this file disease at the same time but on the fourteenth of August, the date of the letter my Mother wrote me from there— all were out of danger and mending slowly— My Mother was with the family at the time.

Very respectfully CB Frazier
