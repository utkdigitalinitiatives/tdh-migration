Mouth of Sweet Water July 7th 1839 Dear Charles Goin arrived safe last evening, and I have taken the liberty of sending him back to acquaint you with some circumstances of late occurrence, in regard to which I am at a loss how to proceed. Yesterday evening some fishermen found a wallet hid in a hollow log about two hundred yards up the creek which they examined and found to contain mens clothes_ the they let me know it & I found them to be Ellick's_ brought them to the house privately & have them in keeping but for which I think he would have been off last night. I think he has no mistrust as yet that I am in the secret, but will have shortly My own course if left unadvised would be to tuck him up & flog him pretty well; but I think it best to in form inform you and wish you take some steps about it or advise me what to do_ perhaps it might be well for you to come over this evening_ but of this you must be the judge_ if you do not come write_ We are all tolerable well Yours &C. et cetera A. Albert S. Lenoir
