Columbia Tennessee January th 1841 My dear Mama As I have not written to you before this week, and you know I promised to write every week. I will write you a few, yes very few lines. To keep you from thinking that I am sick. O Oh ! my dear Mama you do not know how very busy I am. I will write you immediately after the examination, and tell you what kind of a one I stood; which I hope will be a good one. Your affectionate Daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester Mrs Elizabeth Chester P. S. Post Script I have not received a letter from home for three or four weeks. Do write soon. O Oh ! I forgot to say that Cousin Elen Walker has a fine son. I have not had the pleasure of seeing his lordship yet. I beleive believe that they have not named him.
