Hermitage Near Nashville T Tennessee . June 14th 1823 Dear Sir I have recd received . your friendly letter of the 30th of May last. I have seen the pamphlet you alude allude to in your letter, but had not the honour of being a member of that patriotic convention who met in May 1775 in Mecklenburge Mecklenburg State of North Carolina and elected themselves independent._ I was then a citizen of South Carolina adjoining the county of Mecklenburge county but too young at the time to participate in those deliberations which reflect so much honour on the patriotic sages of that day_ Mine was an humbler part, what feeble aid I afforded in the revolutionary contest was in the ranks that composed the defence of our country & of freedom. I can afford you no further information on that subject, but what you have derived from the pamphlet, it would afford me pleasure if I could. I am Sir with due respect yr mo obdt servt your most obedient servant Andrew Jackson J. G. M. Ramsey Esqr Esquire .
