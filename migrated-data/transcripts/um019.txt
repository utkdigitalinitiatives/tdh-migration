Nashville Feby February 6th 1831 My Dear Sister The tenderest thoughts arise in my- mind whenever I call you to remembrance. no time or distance abates the constancy of my affection towards you. Indeed the recollection that we are so far removed from each other is to me a source of great regret. How many are the thoughts I wish to present ⁁ to you which are now precluded. nothing I assure you could afford me greater satisfaction than the pleasure of beholding my beloved sister and participating in the agreeable conversation of her interesting little Family. The anticipation that I shall ever — enjoy that pleasure, affords me a great deal of happiness. Mama has raised my curiosity to the highest pitch by her relation of the many, wonderful feats that little Samuel has performed. he must be a charming little fellow, She thinks him quite a prodigy— Doct Doctor Hayes & family left this place a week or Two since for Cincinnati where he intends locating himself for life.

leaving Nashville that he could not bear the idea of raising a family of children among slaves, exposed to all the baneful affects effects of slavery. he thinks it would be endangering there their morals as well as there their everlasting salvation. I need scarcely inform you that Brother Samuel is happy in the society of his beloved wife. he appears to enjoy the marriage State exceedingly.

She partook of the sacrament on last Sabbath for the first time, Brother Samuel is remarkable for his piety and his engagedness in the cause of religion. He takes a very active part in every thing that tends to the advancement of the Redeemers Kingdom. He is principal agent of the American Tract Society & furnishes the state of Tennessee with tracts. President Jackson made us a visit last summer, I met him at several private parties & had the honour of dining with him at the Hermitage. found him sociable and perfectly agreeable. there is a something in the turn of his sarcastic eye, contrasted with the benign expression of his countenance when conversing with him, that
