At home Feby. February 3d. 1850 My dear Son Your affectionate letter of the 1st Nov November reached us here at Nashville a few days ago. As I passed thro through Washington I examined your reports to the Engineer office where I heard for the first time of the report which had circulated a few weeks that you had been killed by the Indians. You cannot conceive what painful thoughts this report created, even when I knew that it was unfounded. It leaves still the apprehension that you are in danger, and that your safety depends on a great degree of personal firmness and vigilance. These qualities you possess, but above all

you have learned to rely on the protection of a kind Providence which is a better sheild shield than can be supplied by human means. At the date of your letter you had not learned of my departure with all the family from Frankfort Frankfurt . we sailed from Southampton on the 15th Nov. in the steam ship Hermann, and reached home in good health on the 10th Jany January . I found my house much delapidated dilapidated , but the farm in better condition than I expected . The negroes were in good health. Looking at my debts and means to pay them my condition is not so bad as I had anticipated. I have reason to beleive believe that I can discharge all

my obligations without any sale of property should the price of cotton continue good for two years. I go in a few days to Mississippi for the purpose of arranging my affairs there and making another crop there . The source of greatest uneaseness uneasiness to us all is your seperation separation on to and distant a frontier. I told Col. Colonel Cotten that it was too great a sacrifice and that he must releive receive you. My hope is that early in the spring you will be allowed to visit us. My time has been occupied in refurnishing my house. when this is done John will be sent to the college at Nashville and Rachel to the female Academy. your Ma will be confined again in a few days.

I have not yet visited our relations in the neighborhood, but have seen them all. They are well and enquire affectionately after you. I cannot think, my dear Son, of the dangers which surround you without feeling that I am somewhat to blame for you entering upon a career which thus exposed . But it is too late to remedy the evil, in any other way than to meet it manfully. If you live through it, as I pray to God that you may; it may be the means of future good. May it strengthen your constitution and enable you to return with you mind and heart made wiser and better by danger, and better qualified to serve your country & friends. All of us join in love & prayers for you preservation Yr. aff Your affectionate Father A J Andrew Jackson Donelson
