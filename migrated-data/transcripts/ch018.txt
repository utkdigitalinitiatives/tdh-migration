30th April 1802 Dear Sir, I have lately heard the disagreeable news that on the 21st of this month a Creek Indian was killed in Jackson County not far from Mr. Blackburn 's by two men of the names Richmond and Erwin . I have not been yet able to get the information, with sufficient accuracy to determine what steps it will be necessary to pursue to bring the offenders to punishment if the Act should on examination be deserving of punishment. My present impressions are that it was a very unwarrantable Act, perhaps such an one for which the offenders ought to atone with their lives.

The Inhabitants near that place I understand are considerably alarmed and have collected, (a few families together), for greater safety apprehending that immediate retaliation is intended. My Information is further, that Major Russell has collected a party and gone to the mountain in search of some camps of Indians, If he should meet with them I dread the consequences. I think it would be prudent for the Indians to avoid going near that place in their hunting excursions until the present alarm subsides, as any man under apprehension of danger may be induced to do an Act for which he would afterward have cause to repent. If you have received accurate information

on this subject please for make a statement of it to me. You may be assured I will do every thing in my power, consistent with Law to have an impartial enquiry into the nature of the transaction, and the punishment of the offenders if they should be found to merit it. I am Dear Sir with the highest respect Your Mo Obdt Servt Most Obedient Servant Archibald Roane Col.o Colonel Meigs
