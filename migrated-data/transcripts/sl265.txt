Diamond Hill Cherokee Nation — 28th Dec 1802 Sir Two Indians arrived at my house this day, and informed me that at this camp on the Waters of Caney fork in Cumberland a Creek Indian, came to their camp with a horse — and requested one of the Cherokees to accompany him to a House 7 or 8 Miles from the camp for the purpose of assisting him in selling his horse for Whiskey — the Cherokee consented and rode the horse the creek followed on behind a foot, and when coming in sight of the House the Creek declined going any farther — the Cherokee with ⁁ the Horse went to the house and stayed all night purchased some Whiskey in the morning and started for his camp again — when he was pursued by eight White Men — the Creek fellow had got back to the camp some time before the young man that rode his Horse — and when the white men came to the camp he was out in the woods a small distance cutting sadle saddle ties to make him self a saddle... he saw the white people when coming to the Cherokee camp and fled, and was not seen afterwards — leaving behind him at the camp a very fine rifle gun — the whitemen immediately seized the Cherokee that stayed at the House all night with the horse and carried him of prisoner and took gun and his own — This is the account the Indians gave me that has come in and they wish you to make enquiry respecting the matter and rectify the mistake that their companion may be released.
