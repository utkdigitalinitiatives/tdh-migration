Head Quarters & Division T.M. Franklin May 27 /46 1846 Miscellaneous calculations Dear Sir, I have the honor of reporting to your Excellency, that the requisition on this Division of the State for Six companies of Infantry has been filled, that the Captains of said companies have, by me, been ordered to rendezvous at Nashville on the first, or at the futherest by second june next, and that I have been assigned already by a portion of them, that the order will be complied with promptly. Thursday 28th next has been appointed by me as the day, upon which the Cavalry companies, required from this Division, will be chosen, there being already more reported than are desired for the Service__ I will hereafter make a full report. In order No. 2 from the adjutant Generals office, your Excellency has not directed a change of the time of rendezvous for the Cavalry; but if it is desired the companies of cavalry required from this Division can be at memphis earlier than the 15th June. I however may be pardoned for questioning the policy of sending volunteers to Memphis to be mustered into the Service of the United States . This will be doubtless (it has always been the case heretofore) some men and horses rejected as unfit for duty, when they pass muster; and should

they be rejected at Memphis, it will place the men in a very distressing situation, as they (the rejected) are generally of that class of citizens, who are in indigent circumstances, & will not be able to return home without assistance from some source. I therefore respectfully submit it to your Excellency, whether it would not be the better policy to appoint some Suitable place in the Division as a place of rendezvous for said Cavalry companies (which can be done more properly, after the companies are chosen) those to be mustered into the U.S United States . Service by such officer as your Excellency may designate I shall be pleased to hear from you by return mail Yours Resply Respectfully . Tho Thomas H. Bradley Majr. Gen Major General 3 Division T.M__
