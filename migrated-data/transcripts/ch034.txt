Cherokee Agency Feby. February 18. 1837 Dear Brother In my last letter I wrote you that our Agent had given notice that on the 15th Inst. Instant a vote would be taken at New Echota on the 15th Inst Instant to assertain ascertain what disposition the Cherokees wishd. wished to be made of the monies due them under former treaties. I got home from the election yesterday, the votes were taken on the 15 th for paying the Money into the hand of Mr. George Lowrey there were 1269. for paying it into the hands of Major? Ridge s Committee 97. and not one of that number was given in the day of the Election they having been taken previously by the Agent. we met on the river bank on the evening of the 14th in the rain which feel fell incessantly all night. we thought it was best to vote that George Mr. Lowrey should receive the money. believing it was there, and that it would be paid as soon as the election was over. It was agreed on that I should cross the river that night and see the Agent and Know of him what arrangement was made about crossing the river and also to know at what hour the election would open. I went across, in the mean time the people were to be informd. informed of the manner in which it was thought best the votes should be given. I called on the Agent that night he informed me that no arrangement had been made about the ferriages but that if the Cherokees wished it he could pay all of the ferriages of those who were unable to do so out of their fund. I also met with Mr. Kennedy one of the Commissioners from him I was informd. informed that the money was in Washington . that the result of the election would be reported, and the money would be then sent on.- the next morning I returnd. returned to the river and hired a ferry boat for the day of one dollar for the foot Men to cross in. the horse men who wishd wished to take their horses over paid their own ferriages. I reported what I had been informed about the money. we

might have voted it to be paid to the delegation at Washington but as the thing was already agreed on to pay to George Lowrey and their there might be some delays about a report being forwarded. We concluded to make no change in the way we had agreed on to vote. The election was to Commence at 11. Ocl. O'clock we got all across the river, being a very fine day after the rain and proceed.d proceeded on to the place in a solid body throu gh the Town, passd passed , our old council house about 300 yards It was apparrant apparent that our numbers Struck every body there with astonishment. Doct. Doctor Lyle Thos. Lyon and Elijah Hicks were appointed Judges of the Election Spencer Jarnagin . Lovely Rogers , Clerks, the election then commenced. after the election had proceedd proceeded some time Genl. General Wool Said he wishd. wished to make a speech to them the people, but that they need not suspend going on with the votes. Mr. E. Gunter notified the people of the Genls. Generals wish they collected as close to him as they could get Jesse? J. Bushyhead got up on a stump and interpreted; the Genl. General was on his horse. The substance of his speech was that he had been sent here to see that the Treaty should be faithfully executed and that a treaty had been made by which they would all have to remove by June 1838 . that the president would make no alterations. and if any persons told them that there was no treaty they told them that which was not true. and he did not wish to deceive them, that if they did not remove by the time stipulated by the Treaty United States Tropps Troops would be used to compel their removal, he said the Country was a good Country, there was plenty of game there Buffaloes. Deer c et cetera - and he wished them when they went home to make preperations preparations for removal. he also stated that there was Cloathing Clothing on hand at that place for them also provisions, which they could get if they wanted any. the speech was but short and did not seem to make much impression. Some of the people remarked after the Speech was concluded that when they wanted

blankets they generly generally bought them and others that they did not care about Shoes, that Shoes would blister their toes in walking. by night the election closed and the great body had quietly left the ground and were but few to be seen, not one application was made for any of the articles offered. thus closed the 15th day of February . Genl. General Wool requested that Several of the leading men should pay him a visit that evening at his Quarters. George Mr. Lowrey . Gunter , White Path , Money Cryer and Several others went I did not go having some other business to attend to that evening, they had Considerable talk pretty much in Substance of the Speech that he had made, I understood and in the winding up of the talk the General proposed to make White Path a present of a blanket. he replied that he was now getting old and Was there on foot had considerable baggage to carry, and did not wish to increase his load, and must decline receiving the present. the Genl General then asked him if he would receive it for his wife, he said he could not take it. I am told the Genl General was very much amused with his manner of refusal You had best call at the department and find out the exact amount due the Nation, as I believe there is more due the Nation than was reported to us. Genl General Smith had an extract from a letter receivd. received by the Commissioner from the department which States there is due the Nation". (the Amt Amount I do not recollect exactly, but something over $12000-) this must be far short of the amout amount , and ought to be looked into before the money is sent out to the Commission who I understand are to pay it over The three men that I wrote you were taken in the mountains under a charge for having made an attack on one of the Officers I understand has been punished by Whipping of them. without the knowledge of Genl. General Wool , he is very much exasperated

at the commanding officer at that part, and I understand has given orders for him to be dismissed from Service. Bridge Maker was has also been arrested about a week since and is yet confined at Ross's Landing under a charge of opposing the Treaty and exciting the people against it by making Speeches c et cetera Tom Foreman was also arrested the Same day Bridge Maker was, he happened to be in that neighborhood and met with the men who arrested Bridge Maker he in speaking of the the Treaty Said he did not consider it a Treaty for which expression he was arrested and taken out as far as TN? Cleaveland , and was there released and that Bridge Maker was taken on. George Mr. Lowrey asked Genl. General Wool What Charges was were then preferred against Bridge Maker ; he said he had been reported as using his influence in exciting hostilities against the Treaty. and that he had reported the case and that he would be kept until further order. the Troops who arrested him were those stationed at Ross's Landing . these Measures are very severe to the feelings of free men but when a people has their hands in the Lyons Mouth prudence requires them to take it out with great care we have great hopes that when you return home that a course will be shaped that will give some partial relief at least. I believe as far as I can learn the people are anxious to know their final doom, be it good or be it bad. I have no Suggestion to make that would be of any Service to you in your Mission at Washington ; you know our situation. but can only do the best you can for us, we know that the power of giving us relief is not with you. but with the Govmt Government of the U. States . There are probably about 200 Emigrants at this place awaiting for a tide, Some has gone on to Ross's landing in all probably about 300 from the best information, they intend going in a steam boat from this place to Decatur and so on there has been good deal of Sickness amongst them
