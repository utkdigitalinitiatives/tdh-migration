Nashville June 13, 1829 , Dear Brother I am happy to hear of your prospect of making money, being so very flattering - and also of the health of your family. - Tom will perceive by my newspaper, that I have increased the burthen burden on my shoulders - and a pretty Considerable burthen it is - but God willing, I think I shall be able to go through with it. I rest my hopes upon the Legislature - and have the best assurances of Success. We have completely triumphed over our opponents here, and I think it can be used to our advantage - I mean the late publication respecting Gen. General Jackson 's marriage - they have declined publishing it - and I think when it is properly understood it will blast their prospect with the Legislature Hypolits sends her love to your wife, self & children. Write me more frequently Jno John Fitzgerald
