I have just returned from uncle Tims & stayed their 2 weeks and was their when he got home and of all thee the fleshy redfaced whiskered sunburnt ugly savage looking men I ever saw he beats, but he is perfectly delighted with his trip, and says that Misoura Missouri is the garden spot of the world and intends moveing moving in September Helen is their and doing well and behaves herself very well she says she will write to before you come home if you wont won't laugh at her letter. Cousin Henry & Rufus was her here last sunday they were both well and able all was well at home I have not seen the girles girls since you left they will spend the next week with me Mary Jane was with me last week and was very axeous anxious for both of us to write to you while she was here but I had such a good joke to tell you one that she thought I knew nothing about that I would not write untill she was gone you recollect a certain niece of yours that was going to the dancing school in Murfreesboro , she has certainly done move inquiry in the town than any one belle, that even visited the place, she has been the cause of more fighting, and scratching and and gouging, than you eve here of Mr Mister Gowled & Mr Halum took a small fisty cuffy cuff over her. at a party not long ago sis sister what do you think of this I will tell you all about the fights wen you come home but M & Clark have blowed bowed out and gone and I hope he may be blowed sky high or skylow I wont care which before he dies
