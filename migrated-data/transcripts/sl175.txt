Bastrop Nov. 25th 1839 Dear Father I take this opportunity of addressing you a few lines by L. T. Porter We have all enjoyed good health this summer or at least better health than we have done hertofore heretofore We have worked pretty hard but have had but a poor return for our labour as yet but of 75 or 80 acres of ground we have not raised corn to bread us in consequence of its being never grained planted late & having no rain in the latter part of the season but we are now preparing to sow another crop with better prospects we expect to put in 100 acres next season & it is pretty well ascertained that if corn is planted early here that it cant intensely fail even if there should be no rain. I am relying almost exclusively on farming for a living the practice dont agree with me & I am determined not to follo follow it if I can get along without. Joseph expects to get an appointment at the citty city of austin & move up there in a short time he is in nomination for notary republic which will be worth 4 or 5 thousand dollars per annum
