Alexandria (LA) Louisiana 22nd Dec.r December 1832 Dear Cousin I have been in possion posession of your letter so long that I am at this late period almost ashamed to acknowledge it though you must pardon me as you frequently have to make a similar request, my wife, John and myself are in fine health, John is highly pleased with our fine county and nothing but death can take him from it he is busily engaged in attending to gathering my crop and very industrious had an attack of hives last summer but slightly, we have been expecting the cholera to break out among us for some time but had so far escaped it though it has been brought by boats to our town several times, we have fortified counties against it with great confidence and believe that we can battle with it successfully. in part of the world to the population has it produced the distress in a short time as it did in Nue New Orleans , the hospital was so crouded crowded with dead bodies that no price could procure any person to go in to take them out, they had eventually to fix hooks and drag them out and throw them in dress and tumble them in ditches prepared for their reception without their shroud or coffin, hundreds of bodies were buried so shallow that the first rain exposed them, upwards of seven thousand fell victims of which twelve hundred were dragmen a great many were thrown in the Mississippi , on the plantations above and below the city a great negrous negroes were lost. We trust in god and our own exertions. The old Hero is elected by too great a majority I trust never to see another president so popular as it would render our government unsafe in the hands of some

Our crops in this country are fine both of cotton and corn I have out at this time two hundred bales averaging between 460 & 475 lbs pounds and will get between forty & fifty more, my crop will net me I think nine thousand dollars and I only pick twenty two hands judge from that whithin within our county is fine or not ( O oh sweet Louisiana the only land of bread & honey) Henry Overton has not yet arrived we heard that Luis Moore was with him but can scarcely believe it though should be glad to find it so. I think it more than probable that I shall go on to Maryland or Virginia next spring and summer with a view to purchase negroes and shall visit poor old cowpra , negroes I presume can be purchaud purchased in either of the former states cheaper than in Carolina if I go I shall take with me between eight & ten thousand dollars. John is attending to my business at four hundred dollars if I increase my force I shall raise his wages as high as I can afford cotton is selling from ten to twelve & a half. Give my best love to cousin Martha & children Aunt & family Capt Barty & family and remember me affectionally affectionally to all my acquiring friends write me the news you have from Carolina & Alabama John complains of your not writing to him Your relative & friend Tho. Thomas O. Moore write me soon
