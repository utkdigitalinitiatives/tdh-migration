State of Tennessee Cairo 2d augt August 1819 Sir I have just returned from running the line of the Southern boundary of the State of Tennessee as described in the 2nd article of the treaty concluded with the Chickasaw nation on the 19th of October 1818 Beginning on the west bank of Tennessee river at the 35th degree of north latitude, and running thence due West, crossing the prongs of white oaks Hatcher J Wolf rivers leaving to the north the mouth of the latter seven miles and fort Pickering four miles and a half finally intersecting the mississippi about 3/4 of a mile below the lower land of President Island , at the distance 110 miles from its beginning on Tennessee river, This line is plainly marked all the way the trees on each side of it are blazed the fore & aft before and after trees are markd marked with the letters US which is also marked on a Cypress post set up at the termination of it on the bank of the mississippi I have the satisfaction to add that this line passes over a valuable pasture of good land, well timbered and waterd watered . From

From the chickasaw nation major James Colbert and Captain Samuel Sealy attended as chiefs to see the line run. In the afternoons when the sun descended near the horizon they appeared to be dissatisfied and some times said the compass was lost, because it did not run to the setting sun It was in vain that I told them the sun did not set in the west at midsummer, to satisfy them if possible. I halted one on one open ridge free from timber and the next morning being fair I sent for them to my tents and asked them if the sun rose in the East, they answered in the affirmative, I then set the sights of the compass to the rising sun and showed them how deep such a course would run into their land and if I run to the setting of the sun I should run as far into the land of the United States , therefore the middle course must be the true one this seemed to satisfy them for the present and we progressed accordingly with great harmony untill until we approached the mississippi then there their dissatisfaction returned with increased obstinacy, and they observed to me that it was unnecessary for them to go any farther that they knew where the line would strike the mississippi, we was then miles

I pressed them to proceed to the end in order that they might represent fairly to their nation the whole length of their line &c and et cetera they persisted in their first determination but observed that they would meet me at the Bluff after I had finished the line, and talk with me They accordingly met me and substantiated that the line which I had ran and marked could not be the true line, that it must be run when day and night is equal &c. To this I told them I had no answer to make, that the line which I had just completed I believed to be the true one and that I expected it would never be run again officially. There are several improvements at and in the vicinity of the Chickasaw Bluff for which the proprietors are entitled to compensation under the late treaty, they have requested me to make known their claim to the presidents Major Inman Colbert performed the service of an interpreter when on the line if he had not I must have employd employed one at the expense of the United States , for this he expects compensation, I think 150 or 200 dollars would not be badly applied in this way, tho though I have given him no assurance on this head The other chief who attended, Cap Captain says he is a very poor man that

that he left home in a very busy season when he should have been raising corn for his family that and the Indians never pay their chiefs or headmen for their services, therefore he requested me to make known to the President his claim for compensation By the next morning and estimate of the Expenses the time, for the supplies I the cash they could not be had If am permitted to draw on government for the amount the bill will readily command the cash pure I have the honor to be respectfully Sir Your most obedient person J Winchester The honorable John C Calhoun secretary of war If apeal appeal of the line is required I can return it at any time
