Blakely May 6th 1821 Dear Earl I avail myself of this, the first opportunity of conveying a letter to you; We arrived at this place on the 29th ultimo ; after a quiet and pleasant passage from New Orleans , The ladies only accepting the little sickness, which old ocean always tributes, as a passport through his dominions The Genl General is in waiting for information from Col Colonel Forbes , who was appointed by the President, Agent and Commissary to carry the royal order to Cuba for the surrender of the Florida's : whether he has reached Pensacola , or not, we are as yet uninformed. Bronough and Breckenridge have been sent to Pensacola, with a view of Reporting to the Governor of Pensacola, and ascertaining how far things are in progress towards the ceremonies of exchange, we expect their return to day today . Our movements depend entirely upon their report, or at least so much of it, as regards the perparatory preparatory state of the Spanish authority to carry the treaty into effect no delay will take place as the part of our Government. The Genl General is always prepared, and will be prompt and quick. The Regimant Regiment at Montpelier , and the company of Artillery at Mobile will con stitute constitute his military force, and in held in readiness to march when ordered; We will proceed, brobably probably , tomorrow for MontPelier Montpelier , Whener Whenever we will march to Pensacola. We are extremely anxious to leave this place, notwithstanding the efforts of the citizens to make us as comfortable as possible they have served us with, dinners, suppers, sermons and all that such of thing called civility, which a sickly town a bad market and a poor country can hardly make agreeable, and can at most but prove the good wishes of the people Call arrived here on the 1st inst. instant in good health. He brings no news from Tennessee later than what you have All friends were well : Col. Colonel Butler is a provisional Commissioner to take possession of St Saint Augustine , and is on his way to that place. This provision in the Colns Colonels commission, arrives from Genl General Gaines being ordered to Washington whom you know was the first appointed to execute that business The people, I understand, are running from all parts of our country to Pensacola, like Sandhill cranes from snow storms; I am afraid our western boys will miss their aim, and will soon back again with hard times to their brush heaps, for of all countries I have ever seen, I think this promises least, to that

Pensacola if healthy, may attain some eminence in a commercial point of view The character which our nation may give it, the safety of its Port, and the certainty of its market may induce capotalism capitalism to remove there; but this granted, and all the fashionable report which is promised it, I think its greatness much overrated, and this trumpeting mania of many of our people, will and in feverish hard times. This is no business of ours, I shall therefore say no more on the subject. I am sorry that I was compelled to leave New Orleans New Orleans , before you had finished my portrait. I will you again shortly, and will tell you then, whether I will have an opportunity of seeing you again soon. if I shall not see you and you can make a tolerable likeness without farther sitting, I shall thank you to do so, and present it to my mother, Mr Sanders will be instructed to compensate you for the favor you will confer on my mother and myself The Genl. General Aunz , and all their family sent themselves to you, give my respects to Mr Vanderlynn . Doctr Doctor Bell Smith , and accept for yourself assurances of the esteem and regard of your friend and servant. AJ Donalson R.E.W. Earl
