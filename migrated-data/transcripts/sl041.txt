Washington May 15th 1829 — My Dr Dear Sir Your kind letter of the 20th ult,, ultimo has been some days before me—The great press of business has prevented me from attending to it sooner, and even now I can only say to you as it regards our mutual friend Mr Gwinn that he had better remain where he is, untill until you hear from me again. There is more distressed people here, than any person could imagine who were not an eye witness to the various applications for relief— My feelings have been severely coroded corroded by the various applications for relief, and as far as real charitable objects presented themselves, I have yielded my might to their relief — Would you believe it, that a lady who once rolled in wrath, but whose husband was over taken by

misfortune & reduced to want, and is & has been an applicant for office, & well recommended, applied to me with tears in her eyes, soliciting relief, assuring me that her children was starving, & to buy them a morsel of bread she had to sell her thimble the day before— an office I had not to give & my cook was nearly out, but I could not withhold from⁁ her half half of the pittance I had with me. I name these things to bring your mind, that the extravagance of this place, how small a prospect is $1000 pr per anum for the support of a family here, & the moment they are out of office, starvation presents itself to the view— We have not had leisure yet, to make the necessary arrangements of reform— we are progressing, and such is the press for office, & the distress here, that there are for the place of messengers (for the Departments) at least twenty applicants for each station, and

many applicants who have been men of wealth & respectability— Still if our friend Gwinn still wishes to come on here, when we finally organise organize the Departments, and turn out the spurs from our camp, I will preserve an office for him— but we are now having a thorough investigation, into the situation of all the Departments, and the inquiry will be made how many, if any clerks, can be dispensed with. I wrote my overseer the other day on the subject of sending my mares to Stockholder— I would like to hear how many colts I have from Sir William — I learn that the cotton mare & Major Donelsons , has not proved with food. In the day I am laboriously employed, and it is only when late in the night I retire to my chamber, that I have time to think of, or write to, my friends— it is then I feel the great weight of the late affliction

of providence in the bereavement I have been visited with in the loss of my dear wife, I find myself a solitary mourner, depraved of all hope of happiness this side of the grave, and often wish myself at the Hermitage there to spend the remnant of my days, & daily drop a tear on the tomb of my beloved wife, & be prepared, when providence wills it, to unite with her in the realms above— But providence has otherwise willed it & ⁁ ordered to his will I must submit. present me affectionately to your amiable wife & family & believe me yr your friend Andrew Jackson The Revd Reverend Herdy M.
