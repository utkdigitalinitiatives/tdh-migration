Rogersville 5 Jany January 1849 Dear Gov Governor I have no doubt you hav have seen an article in the Jonesboro Whig stating the terms on which you can get the support of that paper for relection reelection if you desire the office of Gov. another term, I know you are acquainted with the editor of that paper. and know he is governed in every move he make by whim or providice I know not his cause of dislike to whigs of this county except when he was a candidate of Congress in 45 he ran considerably behind the whig ticket in this County__ and I think he attaches it to a few leading whig in the County. who he is pleased to denominate a click__ as to the charge of corruption or favoritism in the Bank to this county or this side of the river the charge is as false as it is corrupt.
