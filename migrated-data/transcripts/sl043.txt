Washington Novbr November 7th 1830 — My Dr Dear Sir Your letter of the 25th ultimo has just been recd received and I hasten to reply to it. There are no complaints here against Genl General Purdy , nor have we recd received , any intimation of his intention to resign — but should the office become vacant you may rest assured your enemy shall not be appointed. I recd received a letter from Mr Steel my overseer informing me that Charlotte had applied to you to purchase her, being discounted where she now is — I bought her being the wife of Charles at his request, he appears now desirous that she with her children be sold — I have therefore come to the resolution to part with her. But from the great reduction of hands on my plantation by recent deaths since the first of the year 1829 — having lost set of my best hands. I was glad to hear that you had said to my overseer, that you would pay me here, so that I can get Andrew to reinstate, Charlotte by purchase here
