Nashville , Tenn. Tennessee January 17th. 1844 . To Dear Sir, The undersigned, members of the Central state corresponding Committee, appointed by the Democratic state convention of Tennessee, on the 23rd. day of November last, herewith enclose you a copy of the an Address made by by by published by a General State committee, of which Genl Gov. William Carroll is chairman, appointed by the convention, published by authority of the convention, and respectfully solicit its publication in (Leave a blank here of at least half a line) Although the late state convention, from a sincere wish to promote and preserve harmony in the democratic party made nomination of a candidate for the Presidency; yet it would be doing great injustice to the democracy of Tennessee, to suppose and to the Convention, to suppose that they did not feel a warm and decided preferences for Mr. Van Buren among the prominent candidates aspirants for that high office, whose names it ixpected expected will be submitted to the national convention. The democracy of this state however, will, in all sincerity and good faith, earnestly and zealously support the nominee of the national convention, whoever he may be ; but at the same time, Mr. Van Buren is well known to be the first choice of a very large majority of our democracy. This was plainly and fully indicated, by resolutions of preference, expressed passed almost unanimously by the people, in primary meeting, in narly nearly all the counties and districts of the state, previous to the meeting of the convention in November last . In the language of a distinguished American historian, the democracy Tennessee, received the defeat believed, and yet believe, that in the defeat of Mr. Van Buren in 1840, the democratic

principle was defied, insulted, and trampled upon; and that that principle demands to avenge itself_ not as an affair of human passion or personal ambition. It is a movement from the higher sphere of truth and right; and it is the law of the moral world, that truth and right cannot with impunity be outraged. The Democratic principle, having for a time been overwhelmed by arts and misrepresentations, has gathered energy to throw off the weight that bore it down; it will rise once more in its majesty, to be the guiding light of our nation and the hope of humanity." Actuated by these deep and abiding sentiments, the democracy of our state, entertaining at the same time the highest confidence in the other distinguished citizens brought forward for the office, and willing to support any one of them who may be nominated, we need not assure you, that we we and our democratic brethern brethren would be desired the greater gratification from the nomination of Mr Van Buren through Mr Van Buren is our first choice and his nomination now though Mr. Van Buren is the first choice of the greater numbers of our democracy, yet either of his distinguished competitors for the nomination, will, if selected as the candidate of the party, receive the undivided and ardent support of our party the democratic party in Tennessee. The undersigned beg leave, respectfully, to call your attention to the following resolution, unanimously passed by our convention, and incorporated in its published proceedings. The resolution regards the Vice Presidency, and the claims of our own distinguished fellow citizen, Gov. Governor James K. Polk . The resolution is as follows:

By the selection and nomination of Gov. Polk, whose claims are amply discussed in the accompanying Address, we believe, in perfect sincerity, and from a fair view of the whole ground that more strength would be brought to the democratic ticket, than by the selection of any other candidate who has been named by our friends in any division of the union. His friends in Tennessee, feel confident, that with his name on the democratic ticket, our beloved state would be redeemed in the contest from her present federal position; and we feel free to declare, that his friends in Tennessee, in urging his promotion to the second office in the government, his claims to which have been so faithfully and dearly earned, have not the slightest wish, desire, or anticipation of in any manner forestalling, or in any manner interfering with, the prospective claims of distinguished asperants aspirants , and older men of our party, in any section of the union, in regard to their claims, prospects or rights in the Presidential election of 1848. We make this declaration fully impressed with the amp its import, and in the spirit of sincerity and condone which becomes ourselves and the occasion. We in Tennessee are the more earnest in pressing the claims of Gov. Polk, because we believe, without his name on our ticket, that Tennessee may, and most probably will, continue to occupy her present unnatural and false political position. With his Gov. Polks name on our ticket, all our best talents will deem take the field, and the battle will be waged with a vigor and confidence of success which must result in certain victory. Without his name, we fear that a spirit of despondency of local success may, paralize in an unfavorable degree, paralize our exertion best exertions in the good cause. But for the whatever the result of the nominations may be our friends may every where rest obscured that our best our best exertions, and the faithful (Leave this out, and make four fair copies of the balance)
