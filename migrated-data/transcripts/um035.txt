Brownsville May 1 1838 Dear Sir, The letter written by Veny with your Post script, although written on the 21st of April did not reach me till the 29th I should have written to you as soon as I got the letter, but we heard from Henry Taylor that you were to be over this week, and we have been looking for you. I am very much obliged to you for the money which you propose to loan me. With that I can easily pay the balance on the land. If the roads and water will permit, we will probably be over next week. Julia is anxious to see you all, and I can probably spare the horses better next week that at any other time I race We may not be able to Come, but I think it probable we shall. Julia's health is about the Same, perhaps a little better. The rest are well. We had heard nothing of Bettie's marrying notions, until Veny's letter came, which was the day after the wedding Tell Veny that Jane Claiborne and Henry Johnson (brother of Bob ) were married Thursday. The Johnsons were opposed to it. Tell her also that her old Aunt Lucy Green

died at Jackson last Wednesday. Veny's mother is in town now, and will stay at our house tonight. The family are well. Tell her we will bring her dress, or send it sooner if we can. I had no Cotton up for the frost to injure. Some was sprouting a little, but I do not think it is hurt much. Julia's garden was considerably injured. I expect Jane's first Cotton was ruined. The friends over here are generally well. Jack Taylor's oldest daughter has been very sick but is getting well. Henry's youngest child has also been sick. We will try to get over next week Yours truly Wm. William M. Smith Tell Veny her Ma says if she wants any shoes she must write immediately to me, and we can carry them over
