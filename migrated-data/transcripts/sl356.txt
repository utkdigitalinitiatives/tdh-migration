Cane Hill Oct October 9th AD 1837 Dear Uncle Finis It has been a long- long time since I was favoured favored (should I not have said honored) with as much as a scrape of your pen. To be sure, I have not much strengthened any obligation resting on you to write, by keeping up the shot myself, and now that I am seated for the purpose of writing I am somewhat at a loss for something to say You learned months ago that I was at the General Assembly last spring and it may be, have already declared vengeance against the "Indian Chief." I mean on account of some of the transactions of the Assembly respecting your presbytery &c et cetera . I should perhaps have written on this subject long ago, but a press of business of various kinds (it may be, mixed with a good stock of mental laziness) has prevented me till now. My only reason for having, Lexington presbytery attached to Arkansas Synod was, to enable us to get in possession of some more territory in the state of Missouri which we greatly needed and to which we were entitled by every law of prior occupancy. ____ I had been apprazed appraised that instead of your Synod wishing to lose any of her territory, she aimed at acquiring more, but for what reason I know not. Now sir, after your presbytery is sheared , which I hope will be done at the coming session of our Synod, if it be the wish of your presbytery to be reattached to Mo Missouri synod I pledge, that I will not be the first to oppose it, notwithstanding we very much need and would gladly

have the counsel of your presbytery in our Synod. My little family are well, and have been with very trifling exceptions since I saw you. Crops have been greatly shortened (I mean corn crops) by a unusual drought. The course of the Redeemer had been languishing for some time until recently. The camp meeting season has rather changed the moral aspect of our country for the better. On last tuesday night our camp meeting on Cane Hill closed. It resulted in the hopeful conversion of not less than thirty one, out of which, I hope the Lord will make more or less preachers. May the Lord carry on his own good wor We still have some Cumberland destillers distillers and of the poisonous stuff! Our sulery sullied Elder!!! Let me hear from you and yours frequently. I am particularly anxious to hear from you now. Give my love to Aunt Peggy, Mr & Mrs Almond and all others of our friends yours In the best of bonds B H Benjamin Hogue Pierson Uncle Finis }
