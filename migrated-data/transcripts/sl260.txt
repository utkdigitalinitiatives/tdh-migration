Rock Cave Logan County Ky Kentucky March 20th 1843 My Dear Sister I have at last taken my pen to address you, but allmost almost without the hope of being forgiven for my seeming neglect, of you, altho although it may have appeared such, yet really it was not. I feel as if an appology apology was necessary for my very great procrastination, yet I feel incompitient incompetent to the task of making one, such as you, on even I might deem sufficient, but one thing I know I can say, it is this, that if you will deign to receive this scrawl, you shall not have me to complain of in future, as a procrastinating correspondent, but rather as one that write too frequently (for you know thier there is such a thing) if you could suppose such a thing were possible with me, you must therefore take the will for the deed , ⁁ for you may rest assured that I have willed you many a letter during this winter — But I must now ttell tell you some of the things that I have

been doing since I left Nashville — in the first place, I have been trying to kill time, in the best possible manner, untill I should return to N Nashville , and then I have been going to parties and almost all kinds of frolicks frolics that you can imagine I have received and returned a great many visits, and yet it seems as though I was scarcley scarcly half through — I have also attended church a good deal — I attended the Methodist church at Pleasant Run during the christmas week, at which place there was a considerable reveval revival of religion that commenced then, and has continued, ever since, Mr Redford preached there on last Sabbath, and had quite a stirring time, thar there is also a reveval going on in the Methodist ⁁ church at Russellsvill — I have heard that the people, generally throughout this county, and Simpson , ware were greatly freghtened frightened at this comet, (or what ever else it is) that has made its appearance in the west, I heard that some indeveduals individuals in Franklin closed their doors, and wer were ready waiting for the end, this comet is also to be seen in the Morning

just before day, it certainly is a very strong appearance, at all events — mother Jimmy and my self self returned from Russellsville a few days since, where we had been visiting for three weeks, we had a very pleasant time, Susan Bibb came out with us and remained untill until the day before yesterday, we enjoyed ourselves much in reading and singing, while she stayed with us, I would fill this sheet, but the fire has burnt down, and Nick and Henry are both asleep, and it is now past eleven oclock which is time that all sober discrete people should be in bed, Mother joins me in love to your Mother Susan Miss Jane, and to the boys Mort Jim and Joe, kiss Matesy and sister a hundred times for me, Jimmy sends a kiss to both give my love to Morty particularly, and ask him if he will forgive me for my very bad conduct, and if he will I will promise him faithfully that I to do better here after, we are all well write to me soon and give me all of the news of the day
