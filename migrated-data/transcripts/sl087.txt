[Gift of Miss Emmaline Cockrill ] Franklin 28 th of March 1819 Dear Father Since my letter from Murfreeborough Murfreesboro I have impatiently waited for an exercise of that aspect demonstrated in answering the letter of a friend much less of a Son; to which in equity and good conscience I think myself intitled entitled to but as unwillingness on your part is thus manifested to return a favor soliscited solicited in sincerity, my pen again obtrudes its illegible face upon your patients patience . Unfortunately for the human mind, it is that by the increase of business and a desere desire to accumulate the consuming articles of wealth and plenty, the more noble and philanthropic virtues of friendship, affection, and even the remembrances of our most intimate acquaintances are intirely entirely eradicated from the bosom and that which once was the center of all those wise and endearing feelings which consecrate the existence of generous friendship as the pure scource of the greatest enjoyment is desecrated desecrated by the love of lure and gain to such an extent as to be the recepticle receptacle of those feelings and principles that disharmonise disharmonize the social intercourse of life. I would not that you should concieve conceive of this remark as applied or entended intended for you tho though I must confess I am constrained to believe from some cause there is at least a neglect of the continuance of that respect to me in not writing. For two weeks I was confined in the bar of the Seat of Government when I was released for home to where I parted with hoisted colors and gladsome heart, after having done a good business, and where I shall remain untill until I start for the meredian meridian of Nashville the ensuing Week. Inform Mother that from the resemblance I bare to her in feature on my Circuit, to one of her acquaintances I was known from whom I received a good fee; so much for being like my Mama, the best of Mothers to whom give my love with the rest of the family affectionately your Son Robt.
