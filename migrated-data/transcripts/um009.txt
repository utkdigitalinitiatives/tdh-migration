Hickory Hill Dec. December 25th 1839 Dr Dear Alex Christmas Gifts! & so on, if you please I arrived here last Saturday and am quite happy to find myself here again, All our friends and relations are well except Andrew H's little Boy Coffee who is quite sick with cold and several ails beside but I hope he will soon be well. Andrew and myself will farm it together this coming year & in that time I will be able to buy a farm some where, or other. I succeeded very well indeed in my trip of Surveying and will make several hundred dollars by it. There is no news that I can hear of so I will only add at your requests made to Ma some time since. I send you ten dollars, which I hope will amply supply you, All unite in love to you and relations and wish you a speedy and honorable end of your Colegiate Collegiate career, until I see you or write to you again Farewell, Your affectionate Brother A. J. Andrew Jackson Coffee
