Mouth of Poplar Creek Nov November the 14th, 1836 Dear Charles, After a long and tiresom tiresome journey I have at length arrived at home without meeting with any accident, where I found the family in good health &c et cetera - on my arrival I learned that the whole family of Nails Negroes were to be sold on the 26 of this month, I do not expect to buy any of them as I do not wish to speculate on them and there will be Traders who will give more than I am willing to give. When I came home there was a letter hear here for me from judge Mitchell which was post marked from Tuscaloosa Al Alabama from which I learned that you owned a tract of land which if partly cleared would sell for a great deal more than in its present state, and as you spoke of hireing hiring hands while I was with you I will let you have four hands one year for four hundred dollars payable in advance provided you come for theme them about Christmas and bear their expences expenses to your house and deliver them to me again at the end of the year if you should not wish to keep them any longer but if you do wish to keep them longer you can do so by paying one $100 for each in advance for every year that you keep them, the hands which I intend to hire are Alex, Archibald, patsy, and pegy, both the girls are as good hands as I have in the crop they plowed last summer as much as any of the men and did it as well

these are my terms and if you think you can better yourself by taking them do so I wish you to write to me on the recet receipt of this and let me know whether or not you will take them so that I can make arrangements accordingly It is probable that you have sean seen in the papers that the survayors surveyors are already appointed to survay survey the Cherokee land if you wish to purchace purchase I would advise you to make your own selection as soon as possible as Frederick and Monroe are going to College they can be of no assistance to you in that particular _ I have not received an answer to the letter which you wrote while I was in Alabama but received one from Mr Wilson of Denmark a few days since informing me that my land could now be sold for ten dollars per acer acre , I expect to sell in a short time; whoever buys my land will have to come in order to get a title as I do not expect ever to go so far from home again. Mr Huett and myself have made an exchange of horses and I believe both were glad of the swap Mr Henry Monger the widower was Married a few days since to the widow Mckiney also Mr Dearmond a Widower from Mississippi to Miss Elizabeth Dearmond of Roane Co County he is the Father of the young Gentleman who Married Grizzy Dearmond last fall.

I wish you to make particular enquiry how much Ham could be hired for to a safe employer without any expences to me. we have not heard from Lewis since I saw you. ___ Property in E Ten East Tennessee has taken a considerable rise lands are at least 50 per cent higher than they were last year one of the Ha r leys has some ideas of buying the mill place. I planted about 3 hundred bushels of potatoes and gathered about 2 hund hundred if you come up to take the hands about Christmas you can get a chance of going in a boat as Smith and Burnes will go down about that time you can have the hands at any time without being detained a single day but if you do not take them write to me immediately so that I can dispose of them some other way the family are all well and join me in sending their love to you and family please remember me to Mr Cambell Your affectionate Father H. Henry Welcker
