Knoxville January 17th 1822 D Dear Sir the following [unclear] considerations are offered, 1st is there any man whose personal popularity is so likely to assist in fixing the seat of government permanently at any given point as Andrew Jackson , if so why should he not be our next governor, or why should this not be wished for by those who desire this result___ I am satisfied that this cannot be done with the present legislature. I presume some of them may be commited committed & if the legislature should be called, for the doing of which there is not the slightest precept__ what is there to work on__ literally nothing in the fall of 1823__ there is of necessity a Senator to make__ south of Th B the monies due from the High wassee District will have become due, a great many things will be wanting in the chickasaw country___ I am not sure how Bedford will be represented__ the parties for the next President will be developed___ the Pennitentiary Penitentiary may be received & fixed some where in the east if necessary & the seal of government in the west_ this will buy the ground for another penitentiary house in the west if I should be necessary_ the Judiciary may be revived , ma n y alterations might be made to suit, particular ends, when the publick public sentiment favoured favored those ends & it was otherwise just & proper__ I am very sure that no one thing ought to be done, at the present session

if this should be a call that can be left undone__ the District for members will be attended to__ in 1823 I shall be able to point out persons, who will be prepared to act, as I hope my friends always well, a fair open & honest part_ I believe you have lived long enough to know that all men do not do this__ I know that Jackson has been solicited to become a candidate for a very high office, if he should be elected governor & they are sincere in these views it will give strength &c your to those pretences I read a private letter from the west stating that Grundy had abounded the head of department at Nashville & said that he would speak to me__ this I believe in part but I immagine imagine I understand this matter___ the publications at the Shelbyville & the appointment of the author to office does look a little contemptuous it must be allowed__ how do you do Col Colonel Crab which way is Col E. H. Foster & General Gibbs while looking over the political Hemisphere, I should expect that it is not wholy wholly improbable, that most of the states individually will set up a candidate for President this will prevent a caucus beyond all doubt & congress will have to select one beyond all doubt as a consequence the two great states Pennsyl. Pennsylvania & New York will doubtlessly understand Each other that & the slave question will probably give to East the President___ but whether it will be from either of those states is doubtful, the smaller states will join the south if they can have the President___

so that the smaller states will probably make the President___ will you take time to consider of there matters so far as they concern our Local affairs_ & assertain ascertain how far certain persons will act on them, I know that grundy had different views at the called session, & I as well know he was wrong, I know that if you fall in with my notions that you know how to act, I shall see you in the latter end of march I expect when we can converse more freely I am D Sir PM Millers this letter is nothing more than notes for your comment___ Private
