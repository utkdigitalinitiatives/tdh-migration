Washington December 20 Dear Sir I am in receipt of your letter with its enclosure I went immediate ly to the Commissioner of Pensions and procured him to carry the case up to Mr Ewing for decission decision of the appeal. Upon a personal visit to Mr Ewing he promised to audit the matter and give a speedy decision. this is all that can be done at present and so soon as the decision is made you will be informed and such other steps taken as may be required __ any other business intrusted to me will me from you will receive prompt attention __ We are still in a state of complete disorganization no Speaker has been or indeed can be elected under the present state of voting. and altho although Committees of both Parties are in communication, with a view to a compromise. but little hope is entertained of any favourable favorable result we shall probably never be organized until we adopt the plurality rule. this is the last expedient. and altho painful to all of us to as a change from the ordinary rules and in as far revolutionary in its character yet the wheels of Government cannot be stopped. We would in case of a longer failure in organization cause the Government Stocks to fall, trade to be paralyzed and the suffering friends of liberty in every part of the world to pause with mortification and anguish. they have suffered and bled for freedom and pointed with pride to our glorious land of freedom. shall we too disorganize our Government and thus quench the last lamp of liberty! I trust in Providence it cannot be so and must therefore risk the danger of innovation __ The cause of all this disorganization is the Slavery question You have no idea how deeply pledged all the Northern Democrats Whigs & many Northern Whigs Democrats are pledged to this unholy crusade against our Southern institutions

the spirit of anarchy is abroad and the Union is threatned threatened on all sides the bonds of Party are loosened and every moment we are afraid that the signal of dissolution will be given and all will be over __ I shall stand by our Country and labour labor for the best. hoping that she will be saved Give my respects to friends Yrs &c Yours and etcetera Andrew Ewing
