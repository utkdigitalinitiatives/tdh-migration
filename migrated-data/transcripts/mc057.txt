As to Ham & family my situation is such that it would not suit me at all to take them for so short a time as next Christmas_ I should have to build them a house & build a blacksmith shop & procure tools iron &c et cetera , all of which I fear would take me till near Christmas & it is probable I have iron a plenty in the fire now.
