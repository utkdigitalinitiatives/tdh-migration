June 1st 1828 Dear General, I have just been informed that one of my negroes has been convicted of breaking open a store near Williamsport and sentenced to be hung.—You will excuse the liberty, I have taken, as well as this scrawl— my health has been very bad, ever since I had the pleasure of seeing you at Washington which has prevented me from returning home, I am still under medical advice. I have to request it as a great favor to be permitted to send the negroe out of the state, I am unable and have been confined , In Maryland and it appears, my enemies are determined to ruin my estate— I have reason to believe that in his ha his trial was not an impartial one, and that ⁁ the evidence from some of the negroes were circumstance .— I feel much agitated and believe that justice will not be done. I therefore as a friend to humanity and citizen of Tennessee would beg your permission to send him out of the state— You will excuse this scrawl, and accept my friendship. Yours respet respectfully S. T. Greenfield
