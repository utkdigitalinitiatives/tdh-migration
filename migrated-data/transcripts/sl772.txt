Harpeth Decr December 5th 1825 Dear Sir Having returned home from the duty assignd assigned me for the present, in aiding the engineers of the united states in the examination of the route for the national road from Washington City to New orleans passing through our State. I deem it proper to communicate to you the result of the examination that has been made The engineers commencing at Washington City passd passed along East of the blue ridge to Rock Fish Gap where they crossd crossed over into the valley west of the ridge leaveing leaving Staunton on their right passing through Lexington Salem . Christiansburg Wythe and Abbingdon in the State of Virginia thence pursuing the Stage road through Blountsville . Rogersville and Rutledge in Tennessee to Knoxville where I Joind Joined them on the evening of the 22d ult ultimo , Capt Captain Pousin immediately made me acquainted with the orders and instructions from the Dept Department under which he acted, from which it was obvious that the Several routes so interesting to the people in the different Sections of our State could not now be examind examined . and from the further information obtained from the engineers in relation to the other two routes that have been examind South and East of the mountains I was fully impressd impressed with the opinion that the Genl General interest of our state (for the present)

would be promoted by pursuing from Knoxville the nearest and best route leading in the direction for New orleans so as to make, if possible, this route the nearest and best for the construction of the road. whereby it would be most likely to obtain the preference over the other two routes, with which it must be held in view, we are now in competition, at the same time I believe not entirely without some prospect of Success. To effect this object to the utmost extent that was practicable in the very expeditious examination the enginiers engineers are instructed at this time to make I found it necessary to call to my aid Maj Major Thol Brown of Kingston who had an entire knowledge of the country not only along the route we Viewd Viewed but also that Leading through the Tennessee and Wills town Valleys. and whose information in this respect was of considerable importance to us. He Joind us at Campbells station. and continued with us a small distance after we crossd the Highwassee river , where we were furnishd. furnished by Colo Colonel Montgomery the agent with an interpreter and guide through the cherokee nation , I continud continued on with the engineers untill until we crossd the Southern boundary of our State into that part of the Territory of Georgia inhabited by the cherokees on the head waters of the chickamaggy near the South Eastern part of the Lookout Mountain from, which place

believing I could render the engineers very little Service in regard to the Selection of a route the course they were pursuing I returnd returned home From Knoxville the route we have examind pursues the western stage road to Campbells station 15 miles the three first miles broken Hilly ground though the Hills can be passd passed by an ascent of 4 degrees, without Lengthening the road much the remaining distance rolling and Genl direction Wt West So.

The two routes for this great national road heretofore examind are I understand some over 1100 miles each from Washington to New Orleans. They unite at Mobile from which place to new Orleans much difficulty must be encountered in making the road the route the Engineers are now on from Washington City to where they crossd the Southern boundary of our state is estimated at 592 miles passing about 200 miles through our there for to gain a preference in the place for this route over either of the can be no inconsiderable object us. and when the actual Survey for Location of the road comes to be made in the event. This route is chosen. Then any amendments and alterations for the better can and will be made But I must inform you that the ground viewd from Knoxville to where our Southern boundary is crossd is in my opinion nearly as good for a road as I have ever in the course of my life passd over together for the Same distance when taken altogether the enginiers are hastening to New Orleans where

it is expected they will receive instructions to examine on their return the Canal route also the other routes through our State for this national road. in which event they will inform me and yourself as soon as in their power. I shall be in readiness to meet them at any point they may designate or that may be requird and do any thing to effect this object so important to our state But I am still impressd impressed with the belief that for great national purpose this road ought to be directed to the Mississippi about the middle of our Western boundary with a view to its extension in fe when at the same time much greater being would result to our state. which endeavour to communicate to you fully verbally when I shall have the pleasure of seeing you also the views by which I have been governd governed in relation to the place on which the Genl Govt Government are now advancing towards the making this road respectfully your obt servt obedient servant Newton Cannon His Excellency Wm Carroll
