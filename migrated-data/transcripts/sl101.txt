I received by Cousin Jack a very sweet (though short) note from Cousin Lucy she told me how well she enjoyed her trip to Clarksville. I received a letter from Papa a few days ago, he said that he would send for me as soon as he could, as he could not come up himself and did not go to Texas , he is now in business and cant leave though in every letter his mind is changed and as likely as not in his next he will be ready to leave, I wrote to him that I would rather wait and go down with Dr Doctor Williams and family in the fall, Cousin Kitty got a letter from Cousin Hardy and he is trying to get the Dr Doctor in the notion of moving down to Mississippi and I dont know when the Dr Doctor visits the country and sees what a great place it is but think very strongly that he will be to much pleased that he will move there. You may expect to see me shortly we are now looking for the Dr Doctor and I know he will have a carriage and he says if he got one he would be sure to go to Clarksville untill until then good bye give my love to all the folks, I am very much obliged to you for writing, to me for I am sure if I was the judge I would say that you never made a more impartial choice in your life than when you gave up that very interesting novel for the entertainment of your truly dear Cousin Ann Maria Miss Lucy L. C. Bailey
