Head Quarters Army of the South, Tampa Bay September 6th 1837 . Sir, I received by the last mail authority from the Secretary of War to call on your Excellency for such number of Volunteers as I might consider necessary in prosecuting the war in Florida . Under that authority I respectfully request that twelve hundred men be called into service for six months unless sooner discharged. I desire that four hundred of them be mounted_ that they be organized into a spy battalion of four companies. The Secretary of War desires that the force required for Florida be organised organized into independent companies: if that can be done I request that the remaining eight hundred men be organized into ten companies of foot, but if the force cannot be obtained with that organization, I request that it be formed into a regiment of foot. An office of the Army will
