(A Copy) Executive office Tennessee Murfreesboro June 6 1825 Sir; I am directed by an act of the legislature of this state passed at their session of 1823, "to commence a written correspondence with the government of the state of Alabama and Georgia on the subject of connecting the waters of Hiwassee with the waters of Coosa by means of a canal, as well as the practicability of a canal around the muscle shoals in the Tennessee and through what is called the Tennessee valley on the south side of said river." The object to which our legislature expected that the attention of Georgia would be most particularly drawn, was doubtless that of a canal from Hiwassee to Coosa___ allow me therefore to request, that you will be pleased to communicate any information you may have on the following points Is it probable that Georgia would co-operate cooperate with Tennessee in making the canal spoken? Have you any correct information of the probable expense of making completing a canal from Hiwassee to Coosa? Have you any knowledge of the ground through which a canal would have to be cut, the quantity of water that may be commanded with convenience and the practicability of the plan? Do you know of a skillful engineer who could be procured to make the necessary examining of the ground? Is it likely that

Georgia would take any interest in the canal around the muscle shoals, or would give her aid in the enterprize? Upon the foregoing points as well as others touching the matter, I shall be happy to hear from you as early as convenient; it being important that the subjects with all its lights should be laid before our Legislature at its fall session. Receive assurances of the respect with which I have the honor to be, yr obt servt your obedient servant Wm Carroll His Excellency George M Troup Governor of Georgia Milledgeville Georgia___
