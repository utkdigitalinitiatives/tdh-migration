Knoxville 18th June 1802 Sir General Wilkenson and Colo Colonel Butler wrote to me some time ago that it was the order of the Executive of the United States that the road to be opened in the route to Natchez should be commenced at Nashville and requested the concurrence of the State to License and give permanency to such an establishment_____ The Legislature not being in Session application was made to the Courts of Davidson and Williamson Counties to pass orders to have the road viewed and marked as far as the Indian boundary line___ I have been informed that no difficulty will occur with respect to the county of Davidson. they are Anxious that the road should be opened and will agree to any convenient route The court of Williamson County (which Joins the Indian Line) have made an order that a road be viewed and marked from the Indian Boundary where it intersects the road to Natchez cut by the troops of the United States, the nearest and best way to Franklin ( the County town) and from [unclear] Franklin the nearest and best way towards Nashville to the Davidson County line____ I am informed Colo Butler declines opening the road in that route alledging alleging that he is not authorized by his orders, because the road by Franklin will be three or four miles longer than a direct route from the Boundary line to Nashville__ It was contemplated to remove all difficulty by endeavouring to procure the Consent of the owners of the lands thro through ' which a road in the most direct rout would probably pass but on enquiry this is found to be impracticable at present as many of the proprietors are non-resident. It is to be regretted that an object to highly important to the citizens of this state and Kentucky cannot be carried into

As there will not be a stated session of the Legislature of this state sooner than fifteen months__ as the court of Williamson county probably will not from their order__ as the road through Franklin would meet the General approbation of the Citizens most immediately concerned permit me to indulge a hope that Colo Butler's orders may be renewed and that he may be authorized to open the road through Franklin as laid off by the order of the court Your attention is sollicited solicited to this application, with a request that it may be stated to the President and that I may be informed of the result as soon as convenient I have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest respect your mst obed most obedient Servant Archibald Roane Honabl Honorable Henry Dearborn Secretary at War
