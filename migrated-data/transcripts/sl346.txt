Revivalist Office Nashville Jan January 17 1834 Father Ewing, p.s. Should you again notice Amicus , say nothing of the information herein given, still sprat of him as the unknown Your communication has just been handed to the printer. As a whole I am hugly hugely pleased with it. Amicus was as unacceptable in this country as in yours. You may ask why was it published? I will answer The author of that thing is a man of high political standing- has represented his country in different branches of the Government -- now fills a highly responsible station is a in the Judicary Judiciary department- is an ordained Minister in the church - wears gray hairs. A few days after brother Smith left for pa Pennsylvania , Amicus came into

the Office, read me his communication and intimated to me that he and Smith had had a conversation on the subject, and that it was with the knowledge and approbation of brother Smith that he wrote upon that subject. I disliked the production, and had I exercised my own judgement I should not have published; but as I was acting as agent for brother Smith and as I supposed he had approved the authors intention to write, being thus delicately situated, I determined to let it go for waht what it was worth without not note or comment. Had I approved of the thing I would have expunged the acceptionable exceptionable parts, but I determined not to lay hands upon it. Brother Smith has not yet returned but in a letter he recently inquired of me who Amicus was, and expressed his disapprobation of the piece. So much for Amicus . I am well pleased with your friendly advise advice , and hope it will be profitable.

But did you know the multiplicity of business devolving upon me in brother Smiths absence. you would be prepared to appologize apologize for an occasional typographical error, However I know the Revivalist to be a clear of errors as an paper in West. Your remark in the communication I have taken the liberty to erase for the following reasons: First, it could not profit any person but the Editor _ and he will receve receive all the benefits without publishing that could be realized by its admition admission . Second, An Old Observer so stamps himself upon his communication that all who know the and man recognize him. And I was unwilling that censure should go forth from so high a sources without the privilege of making an offset by way of exploration, and this would have been throwing more stuff into the Revivalist when I am sorry to say too much is already fond found ,

I hope the course persued pursued with this expanation explanation will meet your approbation. The Garrons thought will not be lost. It is still floating upon the Ocean of mind and will yet find a resting place. Rev Finis Ewing Lexington Mo Missouri , T C Anderson Jan 17- 1834 Brother Smith will be at home in a few days- Give us another sermon soon- Your communications are always a treat- With feelings of filial affection I subscribe myself a son in the Ministry of Christ T.
