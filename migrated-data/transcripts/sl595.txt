Fayettville May 16th 1840 Sir From your letter to the "Blues" and the order of the Adjutant General I think it more than probable that a call will be made on Tennessee for Troops for the Rio del norto __ You seem to be of the same opinion but I presume there is no certainty as yet. I write for the purpose of tending the services of a company of mounted Riflemen such men as know how to use that weapon. The company is now of sufficient strength to be reported but we are receiving accession to the ranks every hour and intend doing so until we reach one hundred__ I have seen no account of such troops in the U.S United States . service in Texas and from the character of the duty there I am satisfied they would be emanently eminently useful, and might be mustered in even after the number called for was complete__ We are really mounted rifleman but are ready to do anything that may be required in order to be received. Our men are anxious to be entered on your list for service__ we want to go__ we have volunteered expressly for this occasion and without boasting. the boys (except myself) are such a will not do any discredit to the high character of Tennesseans as marksmen But you know them__

You may make up your mind to receive us and have us mustered in__ for nothing short of an absolute flat unconditional refusal will do in case there is a call for anybody__ If they only call for 1000__ a company of mounted riflemen would be needed for sharp shooters and if we were not needed on horseback we could give up our horses for the artilery artillery or waggons wagons and do as good service on foot as any body Please enter our company of mounted Riflemen from Lincoln _ first __ for service we will send you the particulars in a few days__ and I claim it as a personal favor that you use your influence with the power that be to have us received under the first call__ Very respectfully your obt servt obedient servant & friend F.
