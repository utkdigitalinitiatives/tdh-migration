here I will remark for your instruction in future, so far as an officer acts consistantly consistently in the purformance performance of his duty, in keeping good order and strict disciplin in camps, he should never be complained of, but should be more highly regarded, and meritoriously applauded; and where ever their is complaints of that kind by soaldiers be assured it is more for the want of longer experience in camps, than propriety in complaining, This you may discover in two companies, the officers of one company being disposed to use the orthority authority to subject his company under good order and strict disciplin, and the other to neglect, his duty and the company to become disorderly __ Will it not be preceived perceived at once without the orderly and strict disciplin, nothing could be done in company will purform their duty with ease and facility; whilst the other is always in difficulty confusion, and never ready to do any thing,_ and the officers that will not keep good order, and strict disciplin in camps will bring degrade himself and his soaldiers,__ Mr Harrison informed me you wished me to meet you with a horse on your return that that you must'nt mustn't expect, its not far, and it wont do for a soaldier soldier to complain of a little fatigue tho, I rote wrote to Majr Major Molloy to get a pony for your mother, If could get one that was good conditioned and rode will well , If he gets one you can have the use of it home
