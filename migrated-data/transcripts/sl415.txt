Carthage 6th april 1831 Dear Sir I adress address you by letter because I have no time to come and have a conversation with you. And because also the facts I intend to submit to you can better be weighted by reading and examining them at leisure. When a fact is placed on paper it is a tangible thing and gives to a person who holds the opposite oppinion opinion a chance to disprove it. The present State of publick public Sentiment and tone of feeling requires the imediate immediate attention of every freeman. If Tennessee can now pre true-born patriot (and I trust there are many) it is to him I wish to direct my oppinions It is with his oppinions opinions I hope mine will coinside coincide . This Sir is trully truly the age of demigogueism a time when our hapy happy country is governed in Shadow not in Substance. a time when each aspirant to office considers before and after his election to office not what will benefit the people whom he may represent; but how many good men and honest republicans he can injure or destroy who may be in his way or think differently with him The last Legislature Sir contains examples of corruption and Petty ambition that must be truly appalling to every lover of his country. And it now ought to be the Serious consideration of every voter of Smith County whether men who pursued the course that our delegation adopted last Session should be entitled to their confidence a Second time You will think Sir by this time perhaps I have there is some personal feeling between myself and the members that went from Smith last year if there is Sir I trust I have too much respect for you and your neighbourhood neighborhood to introduce Such a Subject amoung you to; permit me to say I have a higher object in view it is to open of the people that they may

by falsehood for there is nothing intended in to be discussed in this letter but what is the imediate interest of every man in the community. Sir the unconstitutional law passed last Session is one of the acts complained of by the people as a base violation of their rights and liberties. and Sir they complain Justly for the constitution owes its origin to a higher tribunal than legislative enactments that instrument was written by with the mighty hand of the people themselves and one one one of principle objects is to keep legislation within reasonable bounds hence every member of the Legislature before he is authorised authorized to enter upon the discharge of his duties has to take an oath that he well suport support the constitution of the United States and that of the State of Tennessee then Sir a leg representative in all his deliberations is governed and restrained by his oath and the constitution every bill or resolution that comes before him his first enquiry is whether it is constitutional the next enquiry is or should be will it promote the interest of people but Sir you will discover that in the passaged of this law neither of these things were thought of I will now Sir turn your attention to another subject which Seems to threaten the whole country with destruction. I will first give you the oppinions that I have advanced for three years to my friends and I will then, give you the open declarations of some men to confirm that oppinion In the beginning of the Sumer Summer of 1828 and Some time before the Jackson dinner I discovered that Something was intended I could see frequent consultations__ billings and cooings between certain individuals. I was not long before I come to the conclusion that they were a kindly swarm meditating the downfall of every public in the county and bill the In the

He therfore must be remove from office Abram Caruthers was a young man lately married into the Alen family he was without buisiness business with out money and was a suitable Subject for the office of Judge Neal was ? boy it will be recolected he was put in morning free when without Mr Hart the circuit court clerk than whom a more honest and intelegent clerk there is not in the State of Tennessee would be turned out as a matter of course Col Colonel Allen had a Son or an adopted Son who would be most likely to fill his place. Mr Picket who Seems to be a very excellent clerk is county court clerk is sometimes given to intemperance he of course would go out and another of the party would be most likely to to to fill his place the Bank agent would not loan to Colonel Allens creditors nor to his Son to checkover wit,h he of course must be turned out and a suitable person must be in that would answer certain purposes. The trustee ranger and register yes and the Post office too would Share the Same fate thus Sir by the Shuffling of the cards you would See one conextion connection and one family enjoy all the offices Profits of the county all the power and all the money now Sir put all the offices of trust and profit of one county into the hands of one family or one conection connection and you might as well make them a deed in fee Simple of all the lands and all property as well as the people within the county in the fall of 1828 I told Several of my friends the Sum and Substance of what I discovered and what I here relate to you and Since on Several occations occasions to individuals most of those I talked thought it was only conjecture of mine until on movd moved last on avowal was made in a speech

would pull down the Judges and the clerks out of their Seats that he would break down the present System of the Judiciary and if the Judges and clerks went out as a matter of course let them go Among other things that was said in that slump Speech was the defalcation of the officers of the new State Bank I think the words were that Mr Cooper had Stole thirty seven thousand dollars out of the Bank I was at Nashville last week and asked the present Cashier and clerk; they told one that Col Parrish had long since Settled his individual acct account and So had Mr Cooper that as to the derange true State of the Bank they could tell nothing nor did it appear who was defaulter. I know Col Parrish considers himself exonerated as well as Cooper and that if there is any money missing the fault lies not with them.
