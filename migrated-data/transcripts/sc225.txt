H. Rep House of Representatives . Augst August 24th 1842 Dear Sir In a few more days more "the general jail delivery" will come off at this place_ but it will take some two weeks after to secure our release. Mrs B Brown . is yet in her convenient room having made the accession of another fine boy to our family circle_ doing reasonably well, both of them. Poor Waller seems sadly disappointed at times in the withdrawal of the accustomed attention paid to him & often enquires if "Tilly's boy is like his mama". I have proposed to Mrs B. to remain on this side of the mountain until after the next session & to pay you & mrs V. a visit_ but she insist that she has too many children either to stay or to visit with_ We therefore expect to take up our travel to the West as soon as her strength will allow.

The change will save much trouble & violence & give time for the repeal of the law_ which will certainly be done_ The Breach between the Clay whigs & the manufacturers, was wide & deep_ but if the bill finally passes it will heal up but if it fail nothing can restore a good understanding between them. I think it probable that in your state it will operate well for us that the question has been settled. The Dancery rabbit bill has passed Salaries reduced to $2.500_ The President has nominated Claiborne the old member of C. from Miss Mississippi . & Starke of Columbus & Graham a loafing Edelton at Cincinnati Ohio _ The two last poorly suited to the business & will be rejected I think. He declined recommending Barlor though strongly recommended by her Mississippi
