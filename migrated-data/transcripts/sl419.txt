Carthage Tennessee 4th april 1839 Dear Sir I aply apply to you as an old friend and acquantance acquaintance for your opinion in relation to Pensioners and Pension claims. A question has been raised by Some as I am informed whether an attorney acting for a Pensioner can charge his reasonable expences expenses in travelling to Nashville and back or to be more explicit whether he can charge one dollar per day for himself and horse in travelling to draw a Pensioners claim. The oath is very binding Suficently Sufficiently So to prevent his being the least interested; but whether after paying to the Pensioner the whole of his money and then the Pensioner of his own free will pays to his attorney his expences while going for it creates Such an interest in the Pension as is contemplated in the oath he takes previously is the question I wish to know. If it shall be decided that an attorney cannot recieve receive no compensation whatever; Then will the aged and decrepid Pensioner whether male or female but more especially the female be more liable to be swindled out of the money which Government in its unbounded charity designed for their Suport Support . for then no person who values his character or reputation will act for them knowing the danger he incurs while the man of no character or feeling and who is not responsble responsible will be the only person the Pension can employ

another queston question is whether in establishing a claim to a Pension under any of the late existing laws an attorney or agent who collects the proof records and other documents can charge a regular and Stated compensation. You will See that the establishing a widows claim in this county is attended with much difficulty the record of marriage and other testamony testimony being altogether in in in the eastern or atlantic States their marriage having taken place when these western States were not inhabited. I Should have been Satisfied with the Plain reading of the various laws that is the attorney in fact who takes the oath must not be interested in any way whatever but the Pension must wholly inure to the benefit of the Pensioner. But we are likely to have a great Political excitement in our State & every thing that can be Seized upon to make capitol out of to inflame and instead the People will be resorted to. On tomorrow Col Colonel Polk and the varios various other candidates will adress address the people it is a fearful crisis both parties are making ready for the sumers summer's campaign and the whigs as they are called who are now the majority in this districts are aprehensive apprehensive of consequences . I am but an individual it is true but I have as claim as much right to the freedom of my own opinion as any other citizen whatever being a democrat from my youth under the Jeffersonian and Jackson School I should be extremley extremely Sorry to inure the displeasure of any party for mere

opinions Sake but that time I think is fast approaching in our beloved Tennessee. when any one who suports supports the present administration will be singled out as of writing You will do me an everlasting kindness by writing to me by return of mail or as Soon as convenient and let me know whether your opinion as respects the foregoing questions of law I want this opinion for my own particular guidance to impart to my freinds friends as I have and now am employed in establishing Several widows Pensions which will take a great expence expense as well as close aplication application and industry in travelling and hunting up the necessary proof and I trust I should be the last man in Tennessee that would wrong one of these relecks relics of the Revolution out of a single cent my object having been to charge them only what would indemnify me for the Services performed and money expended. I have written a letter about a week Since to James S Edwards Esqr Esquire commissioner of Pensions in which I requested of him the above information and also to obtain your opinion if he thought proper I shall wait fer expect your letter and in the mean time accept the assurances of my great esteem and respect A.
