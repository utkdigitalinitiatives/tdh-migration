Baltimore Octr October 11th 1808 General James Winchester Sir I sent you some time ago a Statement of the money paid me, for my Clame Claim against Foster , which you was so good as to collect for me and will thank you to Inform me if you are satisfyed satisfied that I am Correct, As you very truly observe, our political hemisphere lowers indeed, and tempest Clouds and darkness Seems to hang over us, and I am very fearfull fearful that it will be some time before the Sun of our prosperity will again be able to dissipate them, Those whom I think to be the truest friends of the country have a host of Evels Evils to encounter, it is not alone, the tyrannical measures of her enemys enemies abroad which they have to War against, but they have to fight at home (as a venerable Senator of Vermont says) with against every thing but Trouth Truth & Justice could any good man who loves his Country, have supposed that America could have produced Such men, as we see Inlisted Enlisted against their Countries peace prosperity & Independence alas Sir, is the patriotism of their Fathers buryed buried with them in the Silent Grave and nothing permited permitted but the rank weeds of Ambition and revange revenge to Spring up in its place, it almost appears so to me, I fear our past prosperity has destroyed our National virtue and the enemys of our liberty wants to convince us that all Nations most must be ruled with a rod of Iron, I do however yet trust, that they shall be disappointed, it is not the honest Federalist that I am afraid of, it is the ambitious and designing traitors who ranks themselves among that class of men

and deceves deceives the unenformed uninformed , our Election is Just over for Congress and assembly, I Enclose you the returns from this mornings paper, the great object of the Federalists was to turn out General S. Smeth from the senate of the U. United States but the Election is by a Joint Ballot of both houses therefore they cannot Suceed as the Senate of this State are all republican if it Should however turn out, that they have as Small majority they may probably refuse to go into an Election they cannot however put one into his place that is a federal, but it is thought if they Should have a majority of two or So, that there is one or two of their men so very moderate, that that they would refuse to turn out so usefull useful a member of the Senate, or let our State want a member in that body, in case there should be a Call of the Senate before there next anual annual meeting____ There is no foreign news at present but what the news papers will give you the St. Michales has arrived but it is thought she brings nothing favourable favorable England Calculates largely on the division amongst ourselves, she is truly taking the French policy Divide & Conquer Your friends here are all well, the Scotch Intrest Interest is gaining ground in father Williams Family, Becky is going to bestow her hand to a man from that Country, and if you will allow me to be Impartial in Such a Call I must say that I think she has made a very good choice he is an Imparting Merchant of every Considerable respectability and much Esteemed by all who know him___ I am Sir With Great respect your Huml Sert Humble Servant David Armour
