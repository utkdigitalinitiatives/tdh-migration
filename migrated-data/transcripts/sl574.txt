Bellview 25th apl april 1821 Dear Grnl. General I have at length expected an arrangement, by which I become responsible to you, for the ballance balance due from Young for the Carthage lots. I think you said it was $200__ you also said on being second in this sum, you would convey the title. One of the lots I have second to myself, at considerable sacrifice. It is valuable, and somewhat improved I wish you would take it at anything like a fair price for I know not when I shall be able to pay you this money neither the ballance I owe on the acuout account Or if not this lot, take my Drakes creek land . I have never before been so embarrassed as respects money matters. not my own, but other peoples debts. the amt amount is not great, but such is the difficulty in geting getting hold of money. that I as yet know not how to overcome it. you know I have always been a bad hand this way. I think I shall visit you in long, to advise ways on ways & means. I am glad

that Genl General Jackson is appd appointed Govr Governor of Florida he in my opinion is the best appt that could have been made for that service. The energy of his character will go far in rendering to order the discordant materials of which the population of that country is composed. as respects himself; it is probable that his condition will bettered in point of health. and at the same time afford him the means of providing for a host of his hangers on, who by the late reduction of the army are breadless . We have just heard with deep sorrow, of the explosion of the Robertson steam boat , with the loss of nearly the whole of the crew & passengers. Cannot those occurancies occurrences which have been frequent be prevented in future ? If they can, no time should be lost in affecting them, by such improvement as as experience may dictate. You I expect have before now heard of the cruel murder perpetrated by John Ragland __ on the body of John Duty of this neighborhood some weeks ago. his trial is continued untill until next__ court__ & be bailed, notwithstanding a true bill for murder was found by the Grand jury this I believe is a novel proceeding. I hear that an attempt to murder has been lately made in your neighborhood__ and of several

murders in other quarters, of recent date. It appears that society is becoming more & more vicious. What is or can, be done to correct this inordinate passion? Legislature regulations will not do it. perhaps the highest proof of moral turpitude in society, is the lax manner in which the penal laws are executed. the laws themselves are sufficeintly sufficiently rigorous. but there is not virtue enough among the people to execute them. but enough of this. I sicken at the reflextion I rejoice that I am not doomed to stay here eternally, exposed to the conflicts, & turmoils incident to human life. but that a little time more will dispose of this liniment of day. "But oh the soul that never dies. At once it leaves its day Yr Your thoughts pursued it where it flies And track its wonderous wondrous way. Up to the courts where angels dwell. It mounts triumphant there Or devils plunge it down to hell. In infinite dispair despair . Farewell my friend think on those things while it is day__ for the night cometh when no man can work. Respects to your lady & children I still am, as I have for more than thirty years been your friend.__ Wm William martin
