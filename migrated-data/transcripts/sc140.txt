I have resumed business in the small way, and will not undertake to enlarge it to any great extent until there is a change for the better in the market__ Negroes are generally lower in this country, in the latter part of the winter, than at any other season of the year, and if you should determine to try the market at any future period, my services will at all times be at your command and I would now retain your friends in anticipation of a favourable favorably change in the price of slaves, but for fear of putting you to some inconvenience in the event of such a contingency not coming to pass in a reasonable time__ your friend JM Saunders
