Franklin June 17th 37 Dear Sir Your kind letter came to hand by this mornings mail. I regret to hear of Sophia Craigheads severe illness. Although I am not surprised. I expected to hear of it by every mail. I knew she could not remain as she was when I left that there must be a change either for the better or worse, and from the nature of her disease.

I have not heard the sound of hammer or saw, in the way of improvement, since I have been here. I am like the Irishman, who said that it was the first place town ⁁ that he had seen in his life that was completed. I will remain here a week or two longer and think I will return to Knoxville . I am keeping the Post Master, Mr. C. Stone , from closing the mail. My love to all relations. Yours Always Carrick W. Park
