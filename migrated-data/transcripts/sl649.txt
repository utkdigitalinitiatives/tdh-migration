Oakland 10th Decr. December 1836 . Dear Sir A number of my friends have expressed to me their desire that I would undertake the survey of the Charlston Charleston & Cincinati Cincinnati Rail road route through Tennessee ; their reasons I am told they have expressed in a petition or address to your Excellency which will be forwarded in due time As it is probable you are unacquainted with my abilities as a mathematician, and as it is not probable that much will be said on that subject except what may appear in the address refered referred to, I beg leave to say for myself that in the various pursuits of life this branch of science has with me been a favorite study, and with it I have had much to do in practice In short there is no part of the duty that will present the least difficulty with me unless in estimate of the cost of construction which at best can but be an approximation to the truth, so that this part of the duty in any hands would be the least certain_ This however like the other parts of the service has its rules which govern others (found in books) and by which I can also be governed. But in this I will have the aid of the principal and other sub Engineer and am not as you see afraid to take upon myself at

at least a part of the responsibility; Every part of the Compass and level lines are not only easy but familiar with me. I have mentioned this rail road for several reasons_ It will no doubt be the first to survey it is expected to pass somewhere in this vicinity either by Dandridge or Newmarket to Knoxville __ I am intimately acquainted with the country to be traversed__ I oregenally originally furnished Mr Lucas with all the materials for East Tennessee when compeling compelling his map of the state; this contrebution contribution of mine was the basis also of Mr Rhea s map. In Lillimans Journal of Science No Number 47 v volume 23 / you will find a map of my constructing Mr. Fogg or Mr Bell late Mr Yeatman can furnish you with it, and which I beg you will examine_ It will furnish you with an idea of my powers in topographical drawing, and the article from my pen , which accompanies the map of the minuteness of my observations upon the country delineated_ I do not aspire to the head of the corpse or board if you choose to confer upon me the office of assistant engineer I can only pledge myself that the duty shall be faithfully and impartially executed so far as the execution may depend upon myself, and at as little cost as if commited committed to another, for I

I shall be content with such compensation as the other assistant whoever he may be may agree upon_ Or if you deem it more proper that I should state terms a letter from you so advising me shall be answered. I do not know that I need add more than to say I shall be gratified in serving my friends and the public but above all that you may be found to entertain as high an opinion of me as you see I entertain of myself__ Yours Respectfully Jacob Peck His Excellency Newton Cannon _
