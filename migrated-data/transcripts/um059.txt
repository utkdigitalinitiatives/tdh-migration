Did you send the boys a box this Christmas, I know it would be very acceptable, but I do not think they were expecting one, I also received the package with the triming trimming , and the litter which I kept, I will tell you all about it next time I see you. I was very much pleased with the triming trimming , it was just what I wanted, and I had not been able to get any to sent me here, I had gotten some birt it was very narrow and would not seem prithy , it was very cheap, and will do for some thing else. I have not been able to get my dress made but I will have it done next week. I think it will make up very prettily, and I like it because it is different from all the rest of my dresses, I was very much
