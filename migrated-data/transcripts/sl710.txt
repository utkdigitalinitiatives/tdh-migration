Highwassee Garrison 11th April 1809 . Sir. From information lately received I conclude that you will direct that the Cherokee Chiefs be invited to meet the Commissioners between the 1st & the 21st August next to negotiate with them for the extinguishment of the Indians title to the lands lying within the Chartered limits of the State particularly to the lands bounded on the south by the mississippi Territory . The Cherokee lands in that quarter may be estimated at about one million three hundred thousand acres. The Tennessee line will divide the tract probably nearly in equal parts as to quantity leaving a very valuable tract lying on the river not less than fifty miles included in the mississippi Territory The title to this tract probably might be extinguished at the same time if the Executive should think proper to direct it. It would be saving of some expense & perhaps determine the Indians in that quarter to go over the Mississippi where a great many of their friends are already gone the last year. The tract yet owned by the Cherokees on the north side of Tennessee river above Tellico it is presumed is about the same quality of that first mentioned; & I know that it has years ago been in contemplation to part with the two tracts, & the upper Cherokees to have the pay for the upper tract & the lower Cherokees to have the pay for the lower tract__ On this account the whole may be as easily, or more easily obtained than a part. I am Sir very respectfully Return J Jonathan Meigs Governor Sevier.

P.S. Post Script As to the quality mentioned in the first tract. it cannot be expected to be accurate because the western side has never been measured. nor the meanders of the River taken R Return J Meigs
