Cahauba Cahaba Dec. 14th 1820 Dear James Your highly esteemed favor was duly Received, and it affords me much pleasure to find that you have not forgotten us, although we are seperated separated so far from each other. I at one time enjoyed the pleasing hope, that we are many years resolved, should become near neighbors in this pleasant, and salubrious clime; but hearing that you have again entered in the delightful pursuits of Agriculture in your State. precludes all hope of enjoying that pleasure I fondly anticipated. It is a source of much regret with me. to hear that you have earnestly and warmly selected the fair hands of an amiable and accomplished girl, and that you have been unsuccessfull unsuccessful . This is a check that has rendered the life, of many a promising youth, a misery to himself and a pest to society, But I trust your firmness, and good sense, will counteract such effects, and that you will engage again in the pursuit of a companion, possessing such qualities as will render you a useful and happy Citizen.

in twelve months, , and for a small premium, I would warrant your success. No doubt you are getting tired of this subject, therefore I leave it. Thos. Thomas & Devane King , arrive here about the 25th of Nov. November , they bring so many of a pleasing nature, Money very scarce. and many people entirely ruined, amongst others J. Fellows . My domestick domestic cares are about to be increased, before this reaches you, I hope to be blessed with a fine Son. Our crop is not very good we made about 4,000 Bushel Corn, and about 40.000 lb Cotton. I think upon the whole you had better visit the Macidore girl, and come and Settle on those rich praires prairies . Devane is very anxious to see you he says you must write him. we are not very well, we all have horrid colds. The family all joins in love to you I am your friend. Wm G Parrish to James M King
