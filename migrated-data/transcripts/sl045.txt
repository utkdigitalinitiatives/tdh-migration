Washington Novbr November 13th 1836 — My dear friend. I have the pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of your very kind letter of the 30th ultimo — Situated as I now am it is truly grateful to receive a letter from an old friend. After noting its contents, & perusing the various inclosures enclosures & noting them, I most heartily concur with you, that we live in days of personal & political changes, and I must add of depraved morals — nothing but falshood falsehood appears to be the wepons weapons of our modern newborn White Whiggs Whigs of Tennessee in their late ⁁ political crusade — White , Bell , Payton ⁁ Murry & Co. Company appear to have abandoned truth, and now when the election is over, does not wish to be held accountible accountable for the falshoods falsehoods . It is wonderful that Mr. Murry should now wish to regain my confidence by indravansing to retract what he said of me in his abusive speeches — but either Mr Murry in his note to you, or his informant, has told a positive falshood falsehood — there is no one, in truth, can say that I ever said you were present & heard Mr Murrys speech —

but I have said, and said so to Mr Harris , Mr Murrys brother in law, (as I think a fine & good man) that Col Colonel Jones of Franklin told me in your presence, & in the presence of several others, that he Col Colonel Jones was present & heard Mr Murrys & Mr Paytons speeches — that they were both abusive & boisterous, and that Mr Murry has said called me, on his speech, an old dotard and led by others &c &c et cetera et cetera — that he Col Colonel Jones & some others had noted these speeches, and Col Colonel Jones had promised to furnish me with these ⁁ notes in due time. I have no idea that Mr Harris would misrepresent, but Mr Claibourn has a confused mind, & is said will shoot at times out of a long hand — I will see Mr Harris soon — I thank you for the inclosures enclosures — they add to the collection I have laid on file should I live to get home, a duty I owe to truth & the morals of society will induce me to expose Judge White , Mr Bell , Mr Payton , Mr Murry, and their falshoods falsehoods , so that the moral part, are & truth loving portion of the citizens

of Tennessee, may judge what credit can be reposed in those men, when they make assertions as to the acts & doings of others — I now believe that Judge White has been acting the hypocrite in politics, all his life, and individually to me — that he is unprincipled & vindictive I have full proof — that he will wilfully lie, his Knoxville speech amply shews shows — I can forgive ⁁ & will but I never can forget hypocracy hypocrisy , or the individual capable of it — There is no character I abhor more that the liar & hypo crit Pennsylvania , Maine New Hampshire , Connecticut — are all heard from & all safe for Van Buren — New York & Virginia altho although not all parts heard from will give Van Buren large majorities — Ohio as far as heard from the Van Buren & Johnston Johnson tickett ticket 1700 & add a head but the result very doubtfull doubtful — New Jersey votes on the 15th & Rhode Island , both thought to be sure — but the operation & power of the Banks are

have been powerfully used in Pennsylvania Strong; & pray operate on New Jersy New Jersey , tho though , our friends have no doubt of sweep — we have strong hopes from all information ⁁ recd received — that Indiana , Illanoise Illinois , Missouri , Arkansa Arkansas , Mississippi , Louisiana & Alabama are certain for the V Van Buren & Johnston Johnson tickett ticket — have strong hopes of both Georgia & North Carolina — but the die is cast — the votes in the ballotboxes , tho though not known here. We have a right to believe that Pennsylvania has carried a small majority of ⁁ in the convention — tomorrow will give us the result — the Electoral tickett sure . Major Donelson is with ⁁ us but will have to leave me in a few days to join family at home — I am very busy preparing my message before he leaves & must close, with my kind salutations to every branch of your family and a kiss to my dear little Rachel Jackson & my constant prayers for your prosperity here & hereafter — yr your friend Andrew Jackson The Revd H. M. Cryer —
