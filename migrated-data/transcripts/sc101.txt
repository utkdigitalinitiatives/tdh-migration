Washington 11 June 1813 Dear Sir When I wrote you the other day, respecting the action between the Frigates cheasapeake and Shannon , I did, from the news there circulating fully believe that our vessel had proved victorious- It seems to be generally believed, and I fear with too much certainty that the Cheasapeake has been taken- It appears that in the commencement of the action the British ship was very much injured in a very short time having several mortr mortar & shot away, which injured the cheasapeake to bear down in order to bourd board , and just in the act of so doing so thare there was a large quantity of combustable combustible matter thrown on board from the English ship, seting setting great part of our vessel in a compleat complete flame, which is thought to be the cause of her immediate sinking- It is said, and generally believed, that there was some informed Machine thrown of an entire distructive destructive nature, but what the damage have been, we are not yet informed General Dearborne have taken Fort Grorge , Queentown , and Fort Erie , with little loss, and was in pursuit of the enemy who were endeavoring to make their retreat down to

to the lower Ganaday- Our fleet on the lakes under Commander Chauncey , appears to be Overrunning the British in every opportunity they have when coming into contact with the enemy- I believe the British only posess posses one garrison in U, Canaday , (Moldon) and it is very probable, that the american flag is now flying at that place.- We are progressing very slowly- remember me affectionately to our friends- I am entirely sick at being so long from home, and believe if I was onst onest more there I should never return- I had like to have forgot to mention, that Cozen Cousin Alex. Sevier have had a duel with one of your Captians- A, received a shot through his arm, his adversary one in the breast, but thought not to be mortal- Your affectionate friend John Sevier Col, Sevier
