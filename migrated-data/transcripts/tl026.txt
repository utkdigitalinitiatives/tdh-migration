Knoxville 12th January 1797 Sir Yours of the 8th of November I am duly honored with, and Should have done myself the pleasure of Answering the Same before this time had I been at this place. Some of my family in Washington being much indisposed Which required my presence is my opology apology , together with The severity of the Weather which prevented my return so soon As I intended. I Discovered at the first Sight of the Act of Congress you advert to that tho it would have a tendency rather to encourage than discourage Settlements to be made as low down as the Tennessee River , tho though I make no doubt that Honorable body fully anticipated Very Salutary and interesting consequences would be derived : in The experimented line tried by Messieurs Campble McKee , McClung is reported as I am informed, to Cross Hobeson near the confluance confluent of that and Tennessee River , The act of Congress embraces an Idea, that from that place, the line is to be extended a South to the N. North Carolina Indian boundary. now Sir if the exportmented line Above Alluded to is accurate, will not the unk Course to be run South Immediately cross the Tennessee ! This is an Idea is generally entertained by all those who are Acquainted, and the opinion You know is readily indulged by all who wish to Settle on the Land

The line of conduct I am to preserve observe on this Occasion does not appear to me Sufficiently dilineated delineated : were I to undertake it, I should be much a fraid afraid of erring through a misconception of the line yet to be run. In this dilemma I must be excused from taking Exercising any prompt and decisive Measures, on the subject, Especially as it is the part of candor in me to acknowledge that I do not see my way clear enough to direct such a plan give such instructions as would have efficacy sufficient to answer the disired desired intention. If Congress wish Anything to be done by through the executive of this State, it will be expedient in that Body to be more definitive and explicit, which can only be effected by having the line run and and properly asscertained ascertained , which might perhaps prevent the next Serious events. I have Issued my proclamations on the subject, long Since, and shall proceed to take such measures, as Circumstances, and my powers will enable me to exert. Innumerable complaints are daily lodged against the indians Supposed to be the Cherokees, that they have Robbed and plundered several families of many horses and other property from families on the road Me to Cumberland , and left leaving Numbers Several families in the most distressing and disagreeable Conditions Without a horse to assist enable them to travel with, or any Clothing covering to secure them against from the intensity of the Weather: It is painful in the extreme to hear of such a Conduct, fearing it may be Attended with Serious and

disagreeable events; The people of this Country are far from being in a Condition Temper disposed to receive insults accompanied with agravated aggravated Injuries; neither unk nor will it be prudence in the indians to conduct themselves in a manner that might invite a retaliation of numberless for the innumerable murders and other Crimes of the deepest vice, that they have but too recently exercised committed upon numbers many of the harmless and Innocent Citizens of this Country. I beg you will use your interest influence to have the goods and horses that has been taken, returned taken returned, as soon as possible, and let the indians be informed, the dangers of such a conduct, should they be so unwise as to Suffer it to be Carried on any longer I wish Sincerely to support cultivate peace and Harmony between our frontier Citizens, and the indians, and shall take all the necessary measures in my power to promote the same Inclosed Enclosed you will receive a letter directed to the Cheifs Chiefs Which you will please to have read and explained to them I have the honor to be c c c et cetera et cetera et cetera J John Sevier Silas Dinsmore esqr. esquire
