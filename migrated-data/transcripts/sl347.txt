Henderson County Ky Kentucky June 4th 1823 My very dear Brother Ewing. It has been a long, long time since I either saw you, or received or wrote a scrape to you; I can forbear no longer. I returned a few days ago, from the Forked deer , and eager ly went to the Post office in hopes to have received a letter from you, But alass alas ! there was none; I called at your Bro Brother young they were all well, and Thompson s Family were also ___ I saw Bro Cassett he has corrected a part of your peac piece , & said he would would would finish it as soon as posable possible ; and send it on to Russelleville . I saw young Guthre he says that a great many of the Preachers feels much disappointed; (and I suppose displeased) that your Book was not examined before Synod; (I supposed some of them wished it graced with their tallents talents ) From what I can learn the old P,s Preachers in the lower part of this state are now of opinion that long as their cannon was loading that it has fired too soon for their good; I have not learned much of the popular opinion about it; and I am not clear whether it would not be best for it to answer its self. I do not believe I ever read a Pamphlet where there was as much spirit in it that was as intirely entirely free of the spirit of candor, and truth. If it were answered, I would wish to enquire at the Mad,, of the Synod; (as they are great sticklers for decipline discipline ) How often an an an offending Brother; or Presbytery, ought to be sighted, before a Synod, Presb Presbyterian or Session; could adjudicate on their case And how often Mcadow , King , and yourself had been regularly summoned to appear, and before What P,, Preacher They say that you, & King never had any authority; if so, how did they know it? Is there any other way for a Synod, to know whether a P,, has done right, or rong wrong only by their Minuts Minutes ? If so, does the minuts of the old Cumberland P state that you and K King were not regularly set apart by the imposeteon of hard

That Pamphlet stats states that things were thus & so; &c &c and etcetera and etcetera but I did not know that either in America , or the Presbyterian church (where laws rule, and not men) That it was ever known, or could be known whether a criminal was eithe either justified, or condemned, until they were tried; But in this case there can be evidence of a descision decision , and that published to the big world, without any trial, Por Poor old Bro Mcadow was tried several months, after he was in an other Church; ( I think , this will do for hope) But Illegetemate Illegitimate as you swore, if you would take draught drought of the confession; or a swig of Predestination, as did Nelson &c it would legetitimatized legitimatized , or sanctified you and made you good Presbyterians; They tell us the close in their decipline "in extrordinary extraordinary cases" aludes alludes altogether to the length of time they study divinity, and nothing else; They harp much on the case of poor old Haw ; There is an exact parrellel parallel case in the west Ten,, Tennessee P so the man who was received to ld me himself, a Mr,, Lanear of Nashville ; who was a Methodist, without learning, he joined that P,, and he told me they near proposed to him the confession of Faith at all, he had for something been turned out of his old Church, he produced his papers showing his trial and his previous licensure, and ordination; and perhapse perhaps he had withdrawn after his trial; they deliberated on his case for sometime and finally invited him to take a seat; and never asked him a question on doctrins doctrines ; this is what none of our P,, would have done I know; and I know of nothing that can make that act right, only that DD Blackburn was at the head of it so Lanear told me!!! I apprehend the Nashville Pres,, Presbytery will oppose a division which I will propose at next Synod; I wish you to lend me some aid, in your P,, and write to Calhoon &c &c My Plan is for young Guthrie; Beard , Tom Porter , and myself to constitute the new P,, with some Boys; then there will be K,, Guthrie Foster Cloyd &c left in the old N. P, and the rest of us will make the new P,, as Tom Porter says he will move to the Forked deer , and so will I if god we

We had a very solemn, and harmonious Presbytery this spring; Times in the general seam seem dull in this country; O! that god would grant us repentance and remision remission of sins; our Pride and wickedness I have no doubt is one of the reasons why the old P,, are suffered to pour their venom upon us; I asked Lanear; if in faithfulness the Synod wrote that Pamphlet? why they did not do it long ago? he says that they beleaved believed we would die a natural death, But now their fears are excited: This is a truth that the more sensible, and less honest of them would not have told. Upon the whole it is reather rather my opinion that there had better be something written, whether in the form of an answer to the Pamphlet, or a correct history of our church, the latter appears reather most to my mind; It appears more necessary because there are so many enquiring, at our Preachers and People about our origin if we refer them to Buck 's D Dictionary , they reply Buck has ceased to publish it: and from this late scorching poor Buck has got; &c &c Also I am clearly of opinion that it would be right for you to write, as you were better acquainted with facts &c than any other man living or that ever will live; the last looks strong but I do believe it is unequivically unequivocally the truth. We are all well thank God for his mercies to our Family; Do my dear old Brother please to write me a long and closely written good religious letter. Give my love to all the brethren, R Morrow & Robert steel s wife; let my connection know we are all well; Stoneman s Family particularly. Give Aunt Peggy and little Barnet a hug for me. My Wife and Libby joins in love to you and family. Wm Barnett Finis Ewing
