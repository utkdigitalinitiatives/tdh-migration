Knoxville 12th January 1797 Brothers . I have just now arrived at this place, and am Sorry to be informed that some of your foolish young people have been taking horses and plundering waggons wagons on the Cumberland road; such conduct will soon darken the bright chain of friendship that now so happily is joined to each nation. I hope you that are Warriors and chiefs, do not encourage such proceedings, and I have a better opinion of you, than to Suppose you would any longer Suffer it to be done. You have no reason to think I wish any ill, neither does the great majority of the white people, in case your nation will be friendly. You know I have always advised you, not to let foolish young fellows destroy the good understanding between us. I request you will proceed to make inquiry after the horses

horses and other property that have lately been taken by your people and if you can find any and send the same into this place, in order that the owners may have it again, by which means our friendship will continue to be firm and Strong. I have wrote to person Mr Dinsmore on this Subject, and hope you will pursue such measures as will enable you and him to recover the Stolen property. Your friend brother (Signed) J John Sevier Brothers I am Sorry to hear one of our red friends has lately been killed, and if I can find out that any of our people has been guilty of such a dark and unfriendly action I will have them punished, but I have great reason to hope and believe that it was not any of our people, altho although there is bad men in every nation, yet I am Sure it was not done by a person belonging to our State. I have always told you , that I wished your nation to do well, and I hope they may always live in

peace, and raise their Children in friendship with their neighbours neighbors and brothers the white people. My brothers you know if stealing of horses is Suffered to be done, peace wont won't last long, and you must be sensible your Situation will be dangerous; you are but few in numbers and war will ruin you if ever you engage in it again. Our people lives very near you, and reason will teach you that they dont don't wish to have any disturbances or quarrel with you. Your friend and brother Warriors and Chiefs of the Cherokee Nation
