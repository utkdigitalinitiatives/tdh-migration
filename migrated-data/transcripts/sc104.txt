Nashville April 12th 1815 Dear Sir Yours from Winchester in Virginia has been duly recieved. received The point on which the dist district ct court . decided your case is the only one on which the any person could for a moment entertain a doubt nor could that doubt win except for the interest which a third party had in the liveless land in this state I mean the N Northern States, and I had always thought that it made no difference, but it from the Supreme Court thought otherwise It seems to me however that the decision can make no difference in the avant of the case, and that you certainly must prevail, on the ground that the warrants on which the grants issued, were genuine warrants- They were signed by the proper office I know for I have seen them in the office of the Secretary of No North Carolina . It will be necessary that you make this proof by some person who has seen Landon Carter write, know his hand writing well and has seen the warrants in the office

of No North Carolina - You will also prove that Landon Cartre was the entry taker I think the words of Washington County will show this- If it does not, some person perhaps Jos Green knows he was entry taker Perhaps also the records will also show that the rest was recorded, which Jno John Carter said was not his fathers hand writing-as your Fan is Clerk let some man of respectibility misput the clerks books, and see if the record from the books of the books of the record of the acct account does not appear to have been made at the time it purports to have been I would be will for either mr Mister Lee or Mr Mister Hinet who have been clerks to the commerce of E East Tennessee . and knows how warrants filed from Carters books, - to be a witness at the trials-Either of them can shew show that nothing can be collected or inferred shewing that the Warrants were fraudulent from the Numbers of the warrants You can get some friend of respectable character, to go to Raleigh

who knows Landon Carter 's hand writing well, having seen him write- Let him when there imprint each warrant and testify as to there being genuine, taking a note of the no number of each warrant, and quantity of aris You can have Mr Mister Jos Green also at the trial- It will be agreeable to you, and no doubt to all your friends, to have the case decided at once viz at next June term, and with some acertion assertion it can be done, and I have no doubt it will evintually eventually in your favor when at Raleigh your friend will get the Secretarys Certificate, showing the no number of the warants warrants on which the grant issued, and quantity in each number- I shall be at Knoxville by the 25th this month, and if you desire it will call & see you Yr Yours . very truly Judge Overton The Hon Honorable .
