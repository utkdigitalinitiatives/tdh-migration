Columbia Decr December 21st -1843- confidential My Dear Sir! I have received your letter of yesterday I am very anxious for the reasons assigned to Mr Mister Hogan and yourself__ that the Union should be made a more vigorous and efficient paper, than I fear Mr Mister Hogan's present state of health will enable him to make it. If Mr H Hagar desires to sell his interest and and you should become the purchaser__ you ask my opinion whether the Democratic party would assist you personally as they proposed a few days ago to assist the firm jointly.__ I have good reason to believe that they would. I have no reason to believe that they would not.__ As a member of the party- I can say - that the change if made - by the neutral assent of Mr Mister Hogan and yourself will be entirely satisfactory to me, and especially as you prepare - to leave to your Democratic friends, the selection of the Editor - if they will contribute the amount named a few days ago, and that you will pay him a fair salary__. I would much prefer this arrangement, - to see Mr H. sell his interest to a third person whose future course in conducting the establishment - might be uncertain, and indeed such as to injure the cause. The

Editor who is to be preferred above all others,__ for the coming contest__ is our friend Laughlin. He has talents and experience, is perfectly familiar with the politics of the state and the Union,__ and is extensively known as a sound democrat; In his hands__ I doubt not the patronage of The paper would be greatly increased and the cause advanced. What we want is a sound__ and able Democratic paper__ as a reliable organ of the party in the state.__ He would make it say whilst some others into whose hands it might pass, might not.__ It is a matter of importance,__ that whatever arrangement is made should be speedily made. The public must know nothing of what is contemplated, until it is consumated consummated __ and arranged by the parties.__ In whatever is done I must urge__ that Laughlin's services be secured during the canvass of the next year. After closing this letter, I will envelope it to genl General Armstrong.__ that it may go directly into your hands,__ and not run the risk of falling into the general package for your office and run the risk of being opened by your clerk .__ I would mention to Armstrong its general purport, and of course confidentuality confidentiality , and desire that you will have an early interview with him.__ Any arrangement agreed upon between you and him, with Hogan's assent will be agreeable

to me as a member of the party.__ You see our paper here has taken ground for V Buren Van Buren I mentioned to Hogan and yourself the propriety of the Union's doing The same things:__ to which I understood you both to assent.__ Since my return home I am the more confirmed in the views then expressed.__ A.V. Brown writes under date of the 9th inst instant "The relative strength is estimated as "follows__, Calhoun 24 or 25, Buchanan 11 or 12 1/2 Johnsons 3 or 4__ Cass none, not one I believe unless the Michigan men be counted for him: all the rest for Van-Buren". Cave Johnson, writes under date of the 11th" All the fragments of our party seem likely to unite upon Van-Buren, make his nomination unanimous, and each party seek the succession__ by distinguished services in his behalf." You can if you choose shew show this letter to Mr Hogan, who is my friend,__ and I would do, or advise nothing that would be prejudiced to his interests. I sincerely regret his feeble state of health.__ Shew it to no one else unless it be to Hogan and Armstrong, __ and that in the same confidence, that it is written to you.__ I am Very Truly Your friend James K Polk John P. Heiss Esqr Esquire Nashville Tennessee P.S. I have said to Armstrong that you would shew him this letter. Yrs Yours . &c and et cetera .__
