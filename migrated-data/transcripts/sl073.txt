Batchelors Bachelors Hall Tenn Tennessee Sept September 2nd 1838 Dear Cousin I once more trespass upon the rights of silence. I hope you dont do not think it amiss to wright write me a letter without first receiving one from me. I assure you it would not be atall at all wrong or out of the way you would not trep trespass upon my private rights in the past neither would you throw a burden upon my head and han wich hand which I would feel atall at all loath to answer. You all certainly must be a sort of say nothing set or I surely would hear from you — Mr Col Colonel James K. Poke Polk Esqr Esquire — had a large dinner given to him in Murfreesboro on Wednesday last. great many attended, say between one thousand & fifteen hundred — pretty respectable croud crowd . but the devel devil of it is, about half were Whigs, he made a long and not very able speach speech , and after dinner he got up in the open face of arthority authority and publically publicly — pronounced himself a candidate for goven Governor — Col. Colonel James K. Poke Polk is not the man I thought him, from the account I have had of him. I expected to see some body more than common and I expected

I expect to attend if my bodily sistom system , digestion and — secretion is not two too much out of order. I expect to be at a wedding on the fifth of this month as Maj. Major Baurman is to be a waiter. I think my chance tolerable good — Nothing at present my love to the Dr. Doctor & Cousin Mary — Give my love to Mother — Pat & Jon and accept the best wishes of a friend and relation — Your Friend N. B. Hamilton To James L. Alexander
