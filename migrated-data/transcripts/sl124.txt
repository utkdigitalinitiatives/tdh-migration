Clover Dale . August 7th 1839 . My Dear Sister It was with pleasure we received your letter to Margaret yesterday, having only received a few lines from brother Sam and that only stating the death of your child. we were in suspence suspense and anxiously looked for one from you, knowing how easily Mother is alarmed you ought to have wrote two or three lines at least saying you were well. We all deeply sympathize, with you in your looss loss , it would have given us much pleasure to have ⁁ seen the dear little creature, Yet my dear sister why should you grieve so much now when it is taken away, as I hope there is no doubt on your mind but that it is happy, when our friends are taken away from us by the hand of death and we have doubts as to their situation in another world, then it is the human heart must blead bleed , but when the our loss is their gain why should we greive grieve . You say the company of one of us would do you good, with pleasure would I resign the good society and preaching which I now enjoy to be with you, if it would add to your happiness. yet my Fathers health would not at this time admit of it, I do not think it would be right for me to leave him at this time were it ever so convenient I do not feel satisfied to leave home one night at a time which I have seldom done for the last six month Mag Margaret and I are going to Dr. Carters to morrow tomorrow to see Mrs Dabney . My Fathers health has been much better this week than usual Wm. William has been working near the house this week and he goes often to see him. The next time you write you must say when you are comeing coming . The family all join me in love to you all. Ever your affectionate Sister Sarah B. Bell .

Miss Sally Walkers little nephew Mr. Gilberts youngest child died last week, it went hard with Sally to give it up it had been a great deal of trouble to her, yet she said all she had done for it was a pleasure to her, I am truly sorry for her I can not look at her with out sheding shedding tears it was a lovly lovely little corpse, when I was laying it in the coffin I thought of yours. John James Hardwick is also dead he died the fourth of July of a feever fever in Mississippi . I hope politicks politics does not run so high in your neighbourhood neighborhood as it does here we have heard nothing else for the last three months the election took place last week, the Democrat party beat in this county, Your friend John C. Collier and brothers have injured themselves by interfering in the election to much they belong to the whig party. Last winter I spoke of reading a new novel the homeward bound which we all thought very interesting, it had a sequel called the ame as found, which we were anxious to see Chambers sent it up to us this evening I think like it as I see it ends just as I wished it. have had a very good season here this summer and every thing looks well, we are getting well off the horse way, we have 4 good riding horses and three colts, one will be large enough to ride next year. If you know how to make tomato catsup I wish you give me a receipt for making it, I made some last week but it is not good. I made a mistake in writing this letter, but you must turn it till it comes night , it has been wrote a week but Wm. William could not go to town before this evening.

I do not think he gets any better, his cough is wors worse than it has been for the last few weeks, he is scarcely able to walk a cross the yard without assistance, he lays in bed nearly half the day and is asleep most of the time, he is much changed since you left home. After reading your letter last evening, we all concluded it would do you good to visit us this fall, it would improve your health and add to your happiness, yet one thing we are certain of, that a visit from you and brother Sam would do our Father much ⁁ good he often speaks of you and him, we are in earnest and think you ought to come as it may be the last time you will see my Father in this world which I think very likely, therefore I think you migh might come. Mrs. Mills says she wants to hear of you coming to Dickson if you knew how many were anxious to see you I think you would come. Caroline, Margaret, and William went to the campmeeting on yellow creek , where they had some good preaching. Dr. Marable was drinking which kept his family uneasy all the time, he told the girls they had grown so pretty he did not know them at first, Mrs. Dabney sent her love to you, and says when you come to Dickson she is coming to see you Mrs. Shed Bell died two weeks since, it is a distressed family, I pitty pity the old man as I heard he took it very hard, being blind he is very fretful and peevish, and though he has two daughters at home, they are too fond of visiting to confine themselves at home, but Mrs. Bell was always there
