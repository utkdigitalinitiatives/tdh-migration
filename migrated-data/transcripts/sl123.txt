Clover Dale . November 17.th 1838 Dear Sister I have wished to write you before this, yet I put it off from day to day, thinking I had nothing to say that would interest you, but as William speaks of going to preaching in Charlotte to morrow tomorrow I thought I would take the oppertunity opportunity offered, and write you a few lines believing that a letter from us would afford you pleasure, if there was not much in it. When Margaret wrote you last I was very sick, it was the first time I ever wished to see Dr. Carter when I was sick; I was so very sick in two hours after I was first taken, that I was very willing he should be sent for, you know his manner of laughing and saying he expects you are only playing possom possum , but when he felt my pulse, he was candid and said I was very sick, the next time he came back I was much better he asked me if I had thought I was going to die, I said no for I did not think I should die then. But I have great cause to be thankful that I recovered so soon, for many that was taken sick about the same time, lingered much longer and some are since dead. Your friend Mrs. Ingrum (Cathrin Clemmens that was) died last Month at Mr. Robert West on her way to Charlotte, like most persons that have the the consumption, think ⁁ a change of place will benefit them, she thought if she could only get too to her sisters

she would ⁁ be well, I have not heard the particulars of her death I have not seen Mrs. Collier since, but understood she was much distressed. I hope you are gronewell , I often think of you since I heard you were sick and wish I was near enough to go and nurse you which I would wish to do whenever you are sick, yet that is almost out of the question, The house and yard has been all out of fix for two weeks past, puting putting sills under the back and front part of the house, puting a new floor and raleings railings in the porch, and wetherbording weatherboarding a part of the house, which adds both to looks and comfort. William is now haueling hauling logs to the saw mill to make planks to floor the garret over, he is much in the spirit of improveing improving the place, when you come you will hardly know the place. Mag Margaret says she is now ready for the flower seeds and roots you promised to send her she wants the tulip and wallflower to bloom in Dickson before she leaves it, the drouth killed all our flowers that we have no seed though it is so cold I have to write by the fire, we have a beautiful box of white Chrissantheum Chrysanthemum in full bloom. Mother says she pitties pities you if it is colder there than it is here. We have our new carpet on the floor, which is the admiration of the neighbourhood neighborhood , it is very pretty for a rag carpet. Caroline wove 16 yards of girting last week, which is as good as store girting. And William had some leather tan n ed of which he has made each of us fine double reign bridles so you see we have become quite econnomical economical .

They are trying to build a church in Charlotte, but I am afraid they will not succeed, there is but $500 subscribed yet. Mr. Mar tial shal our favorite preacher moves to this County next month, so we will have the pleasure of hearing him preach oftener, I would rather hear him converse with mourners than hear any other person p r each. On Monday night of our campmeeting, there were two young ladies very much affected and went in to the alter altar , their Mother took them out and was opposed to their getting religion she let them come back under the stand, Mr. Martial Marshal knelt by them, and exacted and prayed more fervently than I ever heard any person, I was siting sitting by them and became deeply interested in them and prayed that they might be converted. that night I received a stronger manisfitation manefestation of my being forgivin forgiven me than I ever had before Mrs. Caldwell has a pain in her nose which is very severe some times, she is very much alarmed and fears it is a cancer Mr. Mill's Sister inlaw in-law moved near here last month she has three daughters two of them are grown and quite intel l igent My Father wishes too to know how many tons of iron you have made this year his health is very good this summer and fall and looks much better than he did last year. Mother wishes to know how many comforts you have made Wm. wrote to brother Sam last week. It is geting getting late so I must bid you good night. They all join me in love to you all 'Ever your affectionate sister Sarah Bell .
