August 22d 1803 Dr Dear Sir, Trainum who last spring stole Mr Montgomery s horse, and who afterwards (as I have heard) was supposed to have stolen one from Capt. Captain Joseph Taylor of Jackson County was seen at the Crab Orchard last thursday evening in company with a man who had lost an ear I have had information that it is strongly suspected that they lately murdered Maj Major Brashear of Kentucky at the Kegg Spring near Duck River on the post road leading to Natchez and robbed him of 2000 Dollars in Gold, and some silver. As I have no doubt Trainum is guilty of horse stealing and from the circumstances believe him guilty of the robbery and murder above stated I am anxious that he should be apprehended for trial and wish you could make such enquiries as migh might lead to a discovery whether he has been in his old range on clinch , and what rout he has gone, whether he has deposited money there &c etcetera I have thought it might be prudent to conceal the information respecting the murder until some further intelligence can be had respecting him. I know you detest a Villain and will do on this occasion what prudence and a love of Justice may dictate I am &c Archibald Roane Henry Breazale Esqr Esquire Roane County
