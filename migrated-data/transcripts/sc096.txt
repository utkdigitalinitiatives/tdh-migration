Washington City January 29th 1837 Dear Sir , By the last mail I had the pleasure of receiving your favour favor of the 11th. inst instant . being the first and only one recieved received from you during this winter.- I congratulate you upon the marriage of your daughter Eliza. She has in my humble opinion made choice of a very worthy man for his companion. You say that you discover by the papers that we are like to have warm work in both houses-Your predictions are likely to be verified-It has already commenced in the Committees of investigation and will worm its way in to the House of necessity- Several members of the House, among whom is Coln Colonel Bell, have been summoned and examined on both sides-and I am informed that Judge White Balie Peyton, Pickman and Calhoun of South Carolina and some others are now under subpoena- and I should not be surprised if the President himself should be summoned- But I presume that if he should be, he will not attend, as he has already addressed addressed a letter to Wise, as Chairman of one of the select Committees, denying the right of the Committee to call on the heads of departments to testify, and saying that unless specific charges are made and, that they shall not leave their public duties

for any such purposes. He says the committee is nothing better than a spanish Inquision Inquisition , and expresses his astonishment that the House should ever have raised any such body. In this letter to Wise, he takes occasion to abuse the committee, & Congress for appointing it and Wise personally, both for his conduct on the committee and for his speeches in the House. But as this whole business will ultimately come before the public eye, I will for the present, desist from giving you any farther account of the matter, as the space of a letter would not be, at all, equal, to a full development of all the villany villainy that is now, here carrying on- It is not known, except by a few who is to compare the New Cabinet- In fact there is less said about it than you would suppose- I will buy and procure you some beat seed- there is none in this place- Present my respects to Mrs Misses . Park. Mrs Misses . White returned a few days ago from Philadelphia and joined the mess, which we all consider as a great acquision acquistion . I am very respectfully Yours. Luke Lea James Parks Esq Esquire .
