Tazwell January 8, 1849 Gov Governor NS Neill Smith Brown Dear Sir The Subject of a candidate for Governor is beginning to excite some interest in certain circles in this end of the State. There is a strong disposition on the part of a portion of the people to get a candidate from East Tennessee . The movement, I apprehend, will secure the conscience of a large and respectable portion of the people. Those who advocate it do so on the ground that we have been deprived of our Senator. A writer in the Knoxville Tribune of last week goes so far as to say that the Whigs of this end of the State will not support any person but an East Tennessean for that office. But I am confident that the writer is mistaken, and that no such disposition exists in the great mass of the Whigs A few may have such feelings the common people never have been dissatisfied with the election of Bell to half the extent that a person at a distance would imagine from certain articles in the news papers. Indeed I

have always believed that a majority of the people were, under the then existing circumstances, in favor of the election of John Bell. Nearly all the complaint has been made by politicians. But be that as it may the present movement will have considerable popularity and strength. There are, however, Some here who think that you are entitled to the track if you desire it. For one I have openly declared on all occasions that there is but one contingency that will prevent me from supporting you over the head of any more in the State. That contingency is if Col Colonel Sneed, whose name has been mentioned for that office, Should desire the position, I shall feel bound to advocate his claims. The relations which exist between us, as well as ties of friendship of the strongest kind, would force me to do so. I could not act otherwise from a thousand considerations. But at present I am sure he does not desire to be a candidate unless, there, he should change his mind and desire the position, I shall support your claimes in preference to those of any other person. I know not what your desire is upon the subject; but I am most clearly of the opinion that if you desire a re-election, you are entitled to the track. Mr Mister Nelson is the strongest man whose name has been mentioned in East-Tennessee. I have understood, though I dont don't know how true it is, that he thinks you are entitled to the race if you wish it. Indeed I think

that he and Crozier are the only two, whose names have been mentioned, who would, under any ordinary state of circumstances, desire to be a candidate. I am certain that Col Sneed and Col Netherland do not. This movement in East Tennessee does not, I am sure, arise from any opposition to you It arises from the cause I first mentioned. Others may be introduced in the discussion of the Subject to give struggle to that, but that is the primary one. I have deemed it proper to make these statements to you, not with the wish or hope of influencing you in making a decision one way or an other; but solely with the view of letting you have a candid statement of the condition of things here__ a thing you are not very likely to get from heated partisans most truly Your Friend OP Temple
