The following is a copy of an answer from the Cherokee Council Newtown 20th Oct. 1823 In General Council, Friends Brothers, The very friendly manner in which you have expressed yourselves towards the members of Council, and those of them with whom you have contracted individual friendships; and the liberal view which you have taken of the progress of improvement, in the arts of civilized life and the regular and becoming manner in which the affairs of the nation are conducted are respectfully flattering; and we beg leave to return you our grateful acknowledgements for the compliment. The many favors which have been bestowed on us by the fostering hands of our Father the President are always fresh in our recollection, and we are ever ready to acknowledge our grattitude gratitude . The cooperation of the red man and the white man in subduing the common enemy during the late war and the blood, which have been lost on that occasion

at Tallassehatchie Talledega , Hillabee s, Enotechassee , Emucfaw s, and Tehopkah ( Horseshoe Bend Horse Shoe ) we conceive to be no more than what might have been expected from our hands as children and true friends to our father the President; those acts performed are a demonstrative proof of the Sincerity of our affections and fidelity and shows the firm hold by which the hands of our father is grasped, and speaks more forcible than volumes of promises. Brothers, we have fully deliberated your communication; the application which you have made under the authority of your mission from the President of the United States for the extinguishment of the Cherokee title to the whole or a part of the lands now occupied by them and lying within the chartered limits of Georgia ; either by exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River , or by purchase; We have to state that the unfortunate part of our nation who have emigrated to the west, have suffered severely, during their separation from this nation and Settlement in their New Country; Sickness, Wars, and

other fatality have visited them and lessened their numbers, and many of them no doubt would, willingly return to the land of their nativity, if it was practicable for them to do so without undergoing various difficulties, which would be almost insurmountable in so fatiguing and so long a journey by men, women, and children, without friends, and without money to perform When we call to recollection the periods which departed our countrymen, acquaintances, friends relatives from us and look to the circumstances and means which caused our separation, we are grieved, the tears flow in our eyes and we weep; Had it been the desire of the remaining part of this nation to have left this country, they would have embraced the opportunity, and emigrated with their fellow Countrymen; but this was not heir desire, they loved the soil which gave them birth, and they have continued thereon; the limits of this nation is small, and embraces Mountains, Hills, and poor lands which can never be settled. The Cherokees once possessed an extensive country, and they have made cession after cession to our father the President, to gratify the wishes

of our neighboring brethren, untill until our limits have become circumscribed; and it appears from the eager desire of our brethren to obtain our lands, that it would be unreasonable for us to presume that a small cession at any time would ever satisfy them. Brothers, the improving situation of this Nation is visible, and have been acknowledged, and it would be reproachful and degrading to our character did we not look to its interest, prosperity and future happiness; you give us one reason why a cession is urged, that is, from the crowded Settlements of the people, of Georgia , We presume that if Georgia were in possession of the whole extent of her chartered limits, that it would not remedy the inconvenience complained of. Brothers, from the comparative view which you have taken of the population of Georgia and the Cherokee Nation you say that the difference is too great ever to have been intended by the great father of the Universe who must have given the Earth equally as the inheritance of his white and red children. We do not know the intention of the Supreme Father

in this particular, but it is evident that this principle has never been observed or respected by nations, or by individuals. If your assertion be a correct idea of this intention, why does the laws of civilized and enlightened nations allow a man to monopolize more land than he can cultivate to the exclusion of others. Brothers, we cannot accede to your application for a cession It is the fixed and unalterable determination of this nation, never again to cede one foot more of land. We will make known to you a coming from our father the President that the boundary line from the Unicoy Turnpike on the Mountains Blue Ridge to the source of the River Chestatee has not been run by the United States Surveyor agreeably to the stipulation or intention of the Treaty of 1819 but it has been run so as to include a larger tract of land than admitted by said Treaty, to the great inconvenience and injury of this Nation, particularly to those of our citizens who lived in that quarter, and have been compelled to remove

As this fact have been reported to the President, we trust that he has given you some instructions relative to the investigation of the subject. With the brightness of the Sun, we renew our assurances of respect Brotherly friendship Path Killer Pl Principal Chief his X mark Major Ridge Speaker of Council his X mark John Ross Prest.
