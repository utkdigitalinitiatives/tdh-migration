Edward Graves During the War with the Creek Nation about the year 1813 or 1814 I lived in Wills Valley in the neighborhood of where Mr. Bell now lives. A body of troops under the command of General White on their way to the Creek Nation, encamped at the foot of the Mountain about two miles from my house. A gang of hogs belonging to my daughter, now Sarah Graves, and her Mother, raised in that neighborhood.
