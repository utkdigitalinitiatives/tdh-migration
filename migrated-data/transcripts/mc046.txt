E. T. East Tennessee College May 13th, 1837 Dear Brother, You doubtless have expected a letter from me long before this time. When I left Taladega Talladega last fall I intended to have written soon after I arrived home; but owing to some cause or other, not to be attributed in any degree, either to any coolness or indifference for any of you, I have deferred it untill until this late period. And now when I have set down to write to you; I have to say in the beginning, that I can write nothing that will be of interest to you, except that, which relates particularly to the family. A few days past Father sent us your letter of March the 31; In regard to which, I have truly to say, that no inteligence intelligence , ever reached us, from you, from which we derived so little pleasure. To hear that any of you is well, is indeed, to us, at all times the greatest satisfaction; but to hear of your distresses of sickness and death is equally grievous. And I have only to state that they do not reside upon you alone, but are mutual; Further more they are such as none can change or amend. We have a letter here, that was written by brother Lewis to Father a few days after he reached Taroahote Terre Haute . He

informs us, that journey was a very pleasant one, that had seen many of his acquaintances on his way and has reached his place of destination without any difficulty. He farther stated, that he was attending to his official duty dureing during the day, and studying the law at night. His health is also very good. Sister Catharine wrote to me a few days since she is well and very well pleased with New Echota ; Mr Lenoir will remain there untill fall, when they expects to return to Roane County .__ Mary J. Jane is boarding with Dr Jordan , and is attending the accadamy academy in Kingston . Franklin is going to school here. Frederick and myself, as you perhapse perhaps have learned, did not return home this last vacation at all. This was owing to our being very busily engaged in a review of some of our studies; and we supposed we could employ our time here more advantageously here than elsewhere. Our College commenced about a week ago, with prospects of a fine school. we have students here from many of the different states; but most of those who are from a distance are from Ala. Alabama It is my intention at present to complete my education dureing during the present sesion session ; but what I shall do next winter I can not say with

certainty; thoug though I would prefer reading history next winter preparatory to the study of a profession in the spring. You can see from the hand write and diction of this letter, that I have been in great haste; you will therefore excuse many of the more gross errors.- -- I hope you will not be backward to write to me as soon as you receive this communication, as I am verry very anxious to know how sister Caroline is, and how all the rest of you are doing. Tell them all they must write to us often, I have not received a line from any of you I left you. They were all well last week home; but were complaining very much of the drouth. Fred, Franklin & myself wish to be remembered to you all; and as to yourself pleas please except accept my best wishes as a testimony of an affectionate brother, James M. Welcker To Charles F. Welcker
