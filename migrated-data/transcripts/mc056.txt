Capt. Captain Lackey 's Roane County April 15th 1839 Brother Charles, Since De Witt left here Capt. Lackey made mention of his having four two year_old mules well grown at their age And are runing running idle as he has no use for them. They have been worked some a few months ago. I told him that I thought you would like very well to have one or two of them to plough this summer as you wish to send your mares away. He says you are perfectly welcome to come up and take any two of the four that you may chose to keep dureing during the summer upon the conditions that you give them good treatment._ I think he prefers to have them at work to runing idle. Yours &c. et cetera James M Monroe Welcker
