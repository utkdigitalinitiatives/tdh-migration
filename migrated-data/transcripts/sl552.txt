Choctaw Agency Jany January 20 1815 Dear Sir I have the honor to receive your letter of the 6 instant Before this can reach you, you will have been advised by Mr Mister Dinssnoor of the prospect of auxiliaries from the District of the Choctaws where he is stationed. At this season almost every man that has a gun is in the woods providing for the wants of his family, it will therefore be improper that you should rely on any efficient aid from this quarter until the hunters return. The few I have found at home seem perfectly disposed to do whatever may be required of them. The late glorious news from N New . Orleans will I expect render it unnecessary for the Choctaws to go there and I expect by next mail Genl General . Jacksons instruction as to their destination. I have every man of influence engaged in the recruiting service and will occasionally report progress to you I have the honor to be with great respect & esteem Your Obt Obedient Servant John McKee B Brigadier . Genl James Winchester con. E Sec. 7 Mr Dnr
