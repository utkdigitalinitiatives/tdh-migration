Spring Place Ga Georgia Feby February 6 1836 Copy To His Excellency Wm William Schley Govr Governor of Georiga Sir I have the honor to transcribe to you the copy of a communication from myself to the commissioner of Ind Affs Indian Affairs And at the same time to advise you that while large numbers of the Creeks are flocking into the Cherokee settlements of Georgia intimations have been made by vindictive Cherokees that at a short notice they could avail themselves of all the physical force of the creek nation to resist the contemplated removal of the cherokees from your Territory Although in the sequel these intimations may all be found to be momentary ebulitions ebullitions of fancy or passion more than any settled design to commence hostilities hereafter, it is considered highly proper that you should as the Executive officer of the state be informed of all that militates against your local laws and directly or remotely threatens evil to your citizens Very Respectfully I have the honor to be Your most Obt Servt Obedient Servant Ben.
