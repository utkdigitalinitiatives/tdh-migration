Wheeling, Virginia May 24th 1821 My Dear Sister I may perhaps incur your censure for not having written you before this but I wished to be enabled to say something specific respecting the probability of my now seeing you — My last was in the beginning of April from Richmond in which I assured you that no exertion should be wanting on my part for me to visit you this summer and it is now with feelings of peculiar pleasure that I inform you there is no existing impediment against my now doing so So fearful was I of disappointment & of nurturing hopes in you which might not be realized that I have delayed until the present time mentioning my departure from Philadelphia for the west. I am now actually on my way out to Nashville , having left Philadelphia on the 9th . Inst. Instant At Pittsburgh I spent a few days as well for rest as a to redeem a promise long ago made, — with Mr. & Mrs. Barlow — the latter is sister of the young lady in Paris of whom you may remember I spoke more than once in terms of admiration & esteem

The kindness of Mrs. B Barlow & her husband made my time pass more agreeably than I could have hoped for in a place so unpleasant as Pittsburgh generally is to strangers The route which I take is circuitous but I shall justify myself better in the eyes of others for the unavoidable expences expenses of my journey by uniting instruction with duty & pleasure — At Philadelphia I had some persons to see & wished to obtain letters of introduction from there, & at this place which is on the Ohio River about 53 miles S.W. Southwest of Pittsburgh I joined my old friend Frazier who is now settled here in business & at whose house I stay — He will join me in Cincinnati & thence we prosecute our course together by way of Lexington , Frankfort & Louisville, Kentucky & perhaps diverge as far as St. Louis . — I should wish to keep company with Mr. F Frazier & must as much as possible be regulated by his movements, — hence a month or more may possibly elapse before I have the inexpressible pleasure of once more seeing you & my dear Father & family. — I mention this to prevent any uneasiness & also any undue anticipation of the period of my arrival. — My Uncle is exceedingly impatient for my return to Philadelphia & to see me finally settled

therefore my Dear Anne Jane make up your mind for my visit's being very short perhaps not more than a fortnight Thankful for the opportunity now offered, let us not repine We are not the only ones whom fate decrees to seperate separate when affections would for ever forever keep us united. I to enter into any details about My Uncle & Richmond friends reserving communications — I saw Eliza Bell twice during the few days I was in Philadelphia last & am bearer of a long letter from her to you — I saw when in Richmond Helly Barlow & her brother Richard who had come down to take her up to Frederick — As I did not go beyond Richmond I did not see Mrs. Grammer It must not from this be infered inferred that I do not still entertain a great regard for her but somehow or another I did not find it convenient to go over to Petersburgh one of my antipathies you know. — With best love to my dear Father, Mother & sisters Believe me — Your ever affectionate Brother John Bell —
