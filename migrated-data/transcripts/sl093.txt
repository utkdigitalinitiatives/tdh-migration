Carter County April 9th 1847 Dear Sir, your letter withdrawing your proposition as to my land was duly rec'd received also shortly thereafter your letter reinstating your original proposition was rec'd received Shortly before I rec'd received these letters I had written to you, a letter in which I declined your proposition, but made you one To this letter I have rec'd received no answer, your two letters above spoken of were not answered because of my having shortly before their arrival written to you, Having come to the conclusion, that my letter probably miscarried from the fact, there was very high waters about the time it started, I feel that it is due to you that I should again write to you, and inform you what my proposition was, I was not certain as to the precise number of acres of land that I own ed in Giles , But suppose there is about four hundred and eighty acres, My proposition was to sell you the whole tract Be the sum mor more or less than Four hundred and Eighty acres for Five Thousand Dollars two thousand five hundred payable on the first of June , the other half on the first of March next, provided however that you should comply with the contract made by my agent with the Tennants Tenants in possession and with the persons that had leased my land, also do Justice by a man by the name of Rainey who

had made an improvement on my land without any special contract upon the doing of which I proposed to Convey my entire interest in the Giles land with a Warranty of the title, and that my Wife would give me, I also suggested that if it was not convenient to pay twenty five hundred Dollars on the first of June , two thousand dollars would do, and the balance in the spring. In your letter last rc'd recieved you ask if you was to fail as to payment of a part of the money at the time stipulated if I would extend indulgence upon the payment of interest, upon this subject I presume if you knew me you would have no fears. The honest energetic man who is trying to pay his debts can allways always get any reasonable indulgence at my hands I seldom sue any person and hope I will not treat you worse than others. It is true if I trade with you, I may need part of the money for I may vest some in land near me, Hence I say to you if we trade I wish to make a trade by which we can both live & prosper. I will therefore expect you to pay me the price for my land, yet if it is not convenient for you to pay at the times stipulated you may expect any reasonable indulgence at my hands, your interest would be as good as any other mans. I of course will expect an early answer from you,

If we do not trade I wish to improve this land for some of my family to live on, will you please give me your advice as to the propriety of having timber deadened what it will cost per acre, and when it ought to be done &c &c et cetera, et cetera Yours Very Respectfully A. W. Taylor
