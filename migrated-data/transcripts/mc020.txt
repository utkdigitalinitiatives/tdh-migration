Vera Cruz 27th March 1847 My Dear Wife I landed here on day before yesturday yesterday in the midst of the storming of the city after a long and tempestuous voyage of twenty five days, I had been in hearing of all the guns, and within sight of the flash—but could not land, until day before yesterday—And when I put my foot upon the shore, I found my company upon the beach for the first time under arms. I drew off my coat and having left my arms on board, I borrowed a carbine and led the company out into the interior of the country to attack a body of Mexicans who were fortified at a bridge— they were routed before we got there but the march there of and back (about 12 miles) made me so sore and tired that I haven't been able to walk about much until to-day today . To day Today I have been trying to get my horse off the brig— but the surf rolls so high that it is still impracticable impracticle , and I expect he will be lost or so much abused as to be worthless. My health is good as usual, that is to say about as when I left home, and perhaps better as I am a little heavier—My men who came from Tampico are all well—We have lost 12 horses— in crossing the gulf— I cannot tell yet whether we shall be discharged previous to the end of our term or not— I shall know something more upon this subject in a few days and I will write to, you in a short time— and will write you a long letter, especially if I am not coming home immediately—

you will receive intelligence as early as you will receive this letter, of the fall of Vera Cruz and the Castle San Juan De Ulloa— It is considered one of the greatest victories ever achieved to have taken the strongest place upon the continent with loss of only about a dozen men— Except three skirmishes, the battle has been fought entirely by our Artillery— producing great havoc, and devastation— The Commissioners on each side are adjusting the terms of capitulation whilst I write— And the Mexican flag still floats over the city & castle— I suppose we shall march in to — morrow tomorrow — But you will see all the particulars published— I have not time to write news now. I write to relieve you from apprehension for my safety— for when I landed it was generally believed that I had been lost at sea—I write too as a token of my affection which requires a letter. My love to Eliza to "that boy" your Ma, Ann & all the family— Your affectionate husband Wm R. William Richard Caswell
