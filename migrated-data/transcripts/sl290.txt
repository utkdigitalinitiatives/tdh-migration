Dr Dear Sir, Will you be so good as to inform me in answer to this note whether Mr Bell , in conversation with you on the subject of the present Congressional election, did or did not observe that all the friends of General Jackson were opposed to his election _ I feel desirous to know something satisfactory concerning this observation, having heard it spoken of frequently, & with reference to the election _ as a friend & relation of General Jackson, it seemed to me as importing something of disrespect to to their character & the cause which they are anxious to promote. Yrs Yours Respectfully And. J. Andrew Jackson Donelson July 4 1824 Genl General Robert Purdy
