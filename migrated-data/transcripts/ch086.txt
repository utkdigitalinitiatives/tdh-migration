Aquohee Dist. District Cherokee Nation April 3rd. 1834 To the Gentlemen of The Delegation Messrs. Messieurs John? Ross . Taylor McCoy , Conard? Timson Hair Conard Gentlemen. I beg leave respectfully to represent to you The injustice and abuse I have suffered of late through operation and under the authority or pretended authority of the Enroling Enrolling Agent Major Curry together with the pretence of the operation of the laws of Georgia . I have made application for redress to Major Curry but could get no attention nor satisfaction whatever. I hope you will take have also applied to Col. Montgomery but he says he has nothing to do in the matter and refferred referred all such business to the Enrolling Agent. I hope you will represent my case to the proper department of Government as I am now turned out of house field old Lame helpless having no place to live at. The following is a statement of the case. My field which I have occupied about fourteen years without dispute or molestation is situated on the Unicoy Road about a mile within the Georgia Charter line. The field was enrolled by David Ross under pretence that he had purchased it from Thos. Thomas Berry a white man having no right in the nation and that Thomas Berry had bot. bought it of my son Thompson Dick? Thompson . But Thompson Dick? Thompson denys denies even making any such sale to Thomas' Berry . And if he had done so that ought not to alienate the field from me as he has no title whatever to it. I will forward with this some certificates which I hope will be attended to by the Government. I am your obt. Sert. obedient Servant Saml Dick his X mark Test J.D. Wofford
