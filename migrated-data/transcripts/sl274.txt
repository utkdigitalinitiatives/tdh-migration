Knoxville July 14th 1821 Sir Your daughter, Nancy and myself have concluded that an union between us would be mutually conducive to our happiness, and have therefore agreed to form a matrimonial connexion connection . In matters of this sort property requires that the parents of the respective parties should be consulted and their wishes regarded. Hence it is that I have thought proper to trouble you with the perusal of this note. You will confer a few on by ascertaining of the feelings of Mrs. Park upon this subject and signifying them as well as those of yourself, so soon as may be convenient Very respectfully Yours C. H. White James Park Esq Esquire
