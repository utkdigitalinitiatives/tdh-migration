Nashville , December 8, 1837 Dear Sir: I this moment received your letter of the 25th of November, asking "what per cent, if any you would probably have to give between Tennessee or Ala. Alabama paper, to obtain Seven or eight thousand dollars in Kentucky paper?" I find on enquiry, that Kentucky paper sold today at 10 per cent for Tennessee; and the brokers say it varies from 9 to 10. They buy in small amounts at 8, and sell at 9 or 10. One to whom I spoke said he could accommodate you with 7 or 8 thousand dollars at almost any time in Kentucky paper for Tennessee & Alabama at 10, or in U.S. paper, so as to enable you to get Kentucky paper at about the same difference. The difference between U.S. paper & Ky. Kentucky here is 2, so that you would have to pay 12 for U.S. in Ten. Tennessee or Ala. paper. Give my respects to Chilton , Hogan, Genl. General Bradford their families, and all my friends. Yours truly R. J. Meigs Mr. Charles F. Welcker .
