cerning, all matters interesting to the United States and the Cherokee Nation . From the powers conveyed to us it becomes our duty to bring to your notice the Commissioners on the part of the State of Georgia . These Gentlemen have accompanied us today for the purpose of showing their credentials. They are commissioned by the Governor of Georgia , but their business has been made Known to our father the President and he has directed us to cooperate with them and give them our aid. In some of the writings which have passed between us, we are sorry to discover that the business of these commissioners is treated lightly and but little attention given to the Subject. For the Sake of good understanding and justice we ask you to listen with patience to what these commiss ioners may have to Say. After taking a deliberate view of all the treaties heretofore made, you will be able to make up a decision. It is better they should be closed in one way or another. As soon as this part of our joint business is settled and

The following communication was this day made to the Council of the Cherokee Nation Newtown 16th Octr. October 1823 To the Grand Council of the Cherokee Nation Friends Brothers, We are happy that a short time has been consumed in the correspondence between you and the State Commissioners. This has afforded us an opportunity of becoming partially acquainted with several members of this council. For the whole body we entertain a high respect, and we trust that with some of you, we have contracted individual friendships. In saying this we do no violence to our own feelings, neither do we lower the elevated character of the United States . People who have never seen you, know but little of your progress in the arts of civilized life, and of the regular and becoming, manner in which your affairs are conducted Your improvement reflects the greatest credit upon yourselves, and upon the

ministers, or commissioners, has always been considered one of the highest contempts which can pass between nations, and has often led to the most serious consequences." Brothers, We have denyed denied all these charges which you have alledged alleged to our dispositions as emanating from the general Resolution; because the Resolution expresses the most friendly disposition, to keep bright the chain of Peace and Friendship which links the Cherokee Nation the Government of the U. States . We are ignorant of any difficulties or breach having taken place between us and our Father the President. Have you appeared before general Council of this Nation at Our Great Council fire at New Town , as Commissioners of the U. States ? And have you been rejected and treated with contempt? No Brothers; such circumstance has not taken place therefore we are entirely innocent of the denunciations, which you have heaped upon us. Brothers, we have no desire that the U. States Should incur any expense of procuring supplies for the nation, on the Subject of your mission. Should you think proper to come forward to Our next general Council at New Town , the Nation will furnish their own supplies, and as for yourselves, you could obtain as good accomodations accommodations thus as the Nation affords. Brothers, we deem it proper to inform you that our next general Council will be convened the first day of September next being, the

Page 15

earliest period which will admit of convenience for the General Convention of this Nation . We take you by the hand in behalf of the Nation ourselves as Friends Brothers.
