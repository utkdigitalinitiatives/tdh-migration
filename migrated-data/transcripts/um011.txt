New Orleans January 15th 1848 Dr Dear Alex I have been intending to write to you for sometime since but did not know until yesterday where to direct my letter to, but Cate informs me that if I write to Barrytown , Washington Co. County you will get the letter. We have no news of much interest from the Army. Genl General Scott has arrested Genls Generals Worth and Pillow for disrespect and also some junior officers have become involved in the same snare . It is a disgrace all around, a disgrace to Genl General Scott for the manner in which he made the arrests & a disgrace to the officers for the matter of the arrest and I see by the Washington Correspondent of the "Picayune" that it has been decided to recall the whole of them and place either Genl General Taylor or Butler in command. I hope it may be so & that those officers implicated may all be dismissed the Service. The people who write from Mexico talk about peace but I do not know what new ground they have to stand on. I am fearfull fearful that it will be many years before we have peace again, but still I do not despair, the Anti war speeches of such men a Calhoun & Crittenden are extensively republished in Mexico and do an immencity immensity of harm in misleading the Mexican people as to the real sentiment in this

country towards them. After a while when the parties have selected their candidates for President probably we may be able to have some united action in Congress that will show Mexico that we will do all we say we will. I must refer you to the newspapers for the particulars of all that has been going on. I am happy to state that I have another Son, now five days old, he is a fine fat fellow and very much like our family. I suppose we will call him Andrew Jackson . Betty is very well indeed, much better than in any of her other confinements. She sends her love to you — Judge Posey passed through here some two weeks since on his way home from Montgomery where he had been obtaining his election as Circuit Judge in the place of Judge Coleman resigned which I suppose you have heard he obtained, although John Moore gave him some trouble. The Judge has the verry very place to suit him and I hope he will have luck to make just decisions and an upright Judge, he looks well and was in fine spirits & gave me a good deal of information of what was going forward at Montgomery. Pope Walker is arriving to be U. S. United States Senator but if McClung wants it, there will be a severe struggle between them. MC McClung is no doubt the strongest.

I heard that at the great overflow in the Tennessee that your loss in Cotton was very large. I am gratified to learn that it is not so and that the loss only extended to that unpicked which was unconsiderable inconsiderable I regret to learn that the Hutching estate loss a valuable boy, Peter during that time by drowning, but we must expect those things sometimes. But time presses and I must close. The cotton market is not good. The best middling cottons selling for about 7 & 7½ cts. cents but I do not profess to give any very correct account of what the market really is. — I received a letter from Joe Slop this morning from St. Louis , where he is going to practice law, he was well and wrote in good spirits. When I get a little more leisure I wish to write you a long letter about furnishing supplies to the Army, and the uncertainty of them making any thing &c et cetera . Write to me if you have any leisure time & believe me truly Yr Your brother Andrew J. Jackson Coffee be sure you drop me a line when you start home, or rather come this way.
