Clover Dale , March 9th My dear Sister I received your letter the 11 of Feb, February last week, little did you think when you wrote it that, the next from Clover Dale would contain such melancholy news we were prepared for the death of our Father, but not for our Mothers Neither can we reconcile ourselves to the idea that she is gone not to return It was all so sudden, that it appeared at first like a dream, yet now at times we are constrained to believe it is all a reality we dayly daily miss them more and more, Oh my dear sister I cannot discribe describe my feelings, had I known as the others did that my Mother was dangerous, and was dying all day I think I would be better satisfied but Dr. Hudson deceived me once and I do not think I can trust him again, he told me that the was she was not dangerous, and would be well in a few days, and as she notised noticed more that day than she had any day while she was sick, I thought she was getting better

untill until she was gone, and then at first I thought she had only fainted. But they are both gone and deeply do we feel their loss, Some of our neighbours neighbors think we ought not to stay so much at home, but we all think retirement best suited to our feelings we have not been from home, except to our nearest neighbours, Mr. Reynolds who lost a child of 3 years old last week, we set up with it from Thursday night untill until Sunday night when it died. it suffered very much and has not been well since it had the scarlet fever which was two years ago, William received a letter from brother yesterday in answer to one he wrote the day Sally wrote to you, we were disappointed in not receiving one from you.
