11th. Decr December 1842 near Alexandria 7th Augt August . 1842 Dear Col Colonel I wrote Sarah some time since & got a distressing letter in answer, detailing her misfortunes although I apprehended an occurrence of the sort I had no idea Brothers situation was a fourth as desperate, and am truly sorry that Sarah has lost the negroes father gave her as well as those of uncle Hardy's, she is in hopes & I am also that you can eventually save them for her, she looks to you as the only friend there that will extend to her the hand of friendship and I must beg of you to do all you can for her, any reasonable expense incured incurred I will pay it, independant independent of that Sarah must not suffer as long as I have any thing to support her on, this Brothers must not know as he may relax in his excurtions excretions to get along, I will cheerfully contribute two or three hundred dollars annually & were more for Sarah & family, but in the mean time they must put their shoulders to the wheel & not be above doing any thing that is necessary for a support, and not be disheartened at their misfortunes but to look ahead but be more economical & prudent for the future. they are young enough & in a healthy country to make a handsome support for a family & they have only to forget the past & work for the future to succeed as well as their limited means to justify them in spending. I hope you will write me fully a detailed statement of their misfortunes on receipt of this. Sarah complains to me of cousin Tom's conduct towards her, but I can not think that he would act

in any manner to distress her unless it was to save himself from some previous transaction (write me confidentially on the subject.) which if that be the case was perfectly justifiable as he has always had to work hard & has a family & should take care of himself, should it be as I suppose & Tom has done nothing but what he was closly closely right in doing, Sarah should not blame him for protecting himself against the imprudence & misfortune of others. Sarah wrote me they had taken off her cook if she has none please him such a one as will answer her & let me know when the money is here & I will remit it to you, I hope & beg you will render her such aid as you may deem necessary & I will be good to you for the amt amount . Our Country has been remarkably healthy I have had but one slight case of fever on my plantation this summer I have not heard of but two deaths, Mr Mister Hynson & Genl General Overton's family are well, Bethiah & Eve are well my health has improved though the attack of 1840 had nigh laid me on the shelf. You have seen that we have elected our Gov Governor . by 1500 majority, the remains of whiging boys prostrate on the plaines planes of Louisiana , I hope the whole Tennessee delegation will resign & give that Democratic state a chance to release herself from the arms of whiging but fear the whig portion of the Legislature are too smart as I see the Dem Democratic . portion challenge them to resign & give the people a chance to elect men who will fairly represent them
