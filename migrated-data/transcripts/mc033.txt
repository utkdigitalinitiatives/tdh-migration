No 14 In Camp near Carmango 28th August 1846 My Dear Wife— I write to let you know how I am, and how desirous I am to see you, our children friends and home again,— I defer the small news with my observations upon the country— upon the "horrors of war"— &c &c, and et cetera and et cetera until my return— Since I wrote you last, I have been doing nothing but loafing about our camps— writing, copying and recording orders for the Brigade, and but little besides— The Adjutant General assigned to this Brigade has just joined our family— he is one the men promoted for his gallantry in the battles of 8th & 9th— May — Capt. Captain O. F. Winship — Our Army are slowly moving off from here towards Monterey — I think we will get off next week— Last night, Col. Colonel Kays and Col. Colonel Peyton took supper with us,— Kays is just from the interior, he brings news that Paredes is a prisoner, and that Santa Anna is recalled, if so, we shall have no battle, and in all probability a peace will be made between the two governments before we ever march beyond the Mountains— There is a great deal of sickness in camps— It is oweing owing to the imprudent exposure of the men, and imprudence in diet, and want of cleanliness— Some however with all precautions, in this climate take sick—As for myself, I am as well as usual, I think if I had kept with my company I should have fattened— It has been a long while since I have heard from you; and I must now certainly⁁ begin to get some letters in a few days— I am very anxious to hear as you must know I am how your health is, and all about that little boy— I have been encouraged to hope that you had regained your strength— I shall fly to see you as soon as I am discharged from the Army— Since I am here, and came for the purpose, I would be glad to have an engagement with the enemy, but having now but little hopes, of doing anything for the Country or for myself— I am getting impatient, so much so, and so pleasant a place does Russelville now seems to me, that I think I will be contented to live there Your affectionate husband— Wm. R. William Richard Caswell
