D. Letter from the Hon. Honorable John C. Calhoun , secretary of War to Jerh. Jeremiah Evarts Esq. Esquire Rev. Elias Cornelius , in answer to theirs of 15th. July 1818 dated Department of War 15 July 1818 Sirs, I am directed by the President to assure you, and through you the Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, that he has the best disposition to afford Every Encouragement in his power to the benevolent Efforts of the society, to diffuse knowledge civilization among our Indian neighbors; that he views, with approbation, the judicious measures which have already been adopted by the Board to Effect these objects. The public lands, after the Extinguishment of the Indian title, being Entirely under the disposition control of Congress, that body, only, can give the assurance desired by the Board, as to the disposition which may be made after an extinguishment of the Indian title, of the lands on which the schools of the missionaries may be Established. The agent for the Cherokee nation will be directed to furnish as great a number of the ordinary implements of husbandry of domestic manufactures, as, in his opinion, the exigencies of the school already Established there may require. So the four youths which are now with you, on their way to the school in Connecticut, one hundred

dollars a year will be allowed to Each, while at school, provided the term of their tuition does not exceed four years. The assistance requested in erecting a corn mill near each station will, if practicable, be afforded. As it is the wish of the President that the Arkansas should be the permanent home of the Cherokees , he would be particularly friendly to the Establishment of schools among the Cherokees there, and will render such aids as the public interest the state of the Indian appropriation may permit. I have the honor to be, Your obedt. obedient servant signed John C. Calhoun Rev. Jerh. Evarts , Rev. Elias Cornelius
