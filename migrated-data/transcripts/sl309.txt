Washington February 22 1841 My Dear Sir, Your letter of the letter of the 11th inst instant has just been recieved received , and I hasten to state to you the condition of the claim of the Heirs of Col Colonel H. Dixon decd deceased __ I have passed the numbers of the committee on Revolutionary claims to dicision decision of that claim, but I have found them opposed to doing any thing this session as they alledged alleged that if it was reported upon, no bill could be passed at this session. I have however pressed them to examine the papers & see if they would make a favourable favorable report upon it, and to day I have been informed that they will decide against the claim on the ground that they will presume payment, or account of the fact that a portion has been paid & the great length of time which has been permitted to elapse. They say they will require explanation & evidence of the cause of the
