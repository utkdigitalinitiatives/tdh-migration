Obedient Servant Henry Banks you will see in my memorial that I lost by patriotism about $150.000 during the Revolution before I was of age, and now when I am on the brink of the grave to loose lose more than $100.000 again for patriotism & that I yet resolve while I live, to continue a patriot and at my post
