near Alexandria 30th Nov November . 1849 Dear Col Colonel Answered 25th January 1850 I red received a letter from Sarah under date of 10th inst instant . informing me of the decision of the suit for those negroes that went against her, which I exceedingly regret, poor Sarah! the case is nolly a hard one. She wishes me to aid her in purchasing them at the sale which she writes takes place on the 10th April next, I am at this moment in the worst possible condition to assist her, having undergone this year an enormous expense of building my larger house, & purchasing mill & engine & other fixtures which will cost me at least Fifteen Thousand dollars, and my crop a small one for want of a sufficent sufficient quantity of seed came last spring to plant, I shall grind only 130 acres which is very grim in consequince consequence of the warm winter & shall make about 200 hogsheads & 400 barrels of molasses, my cane would have been perfectly good for 300 hogsheads with an ordinary winter, it looks now as grim & fresh as it did in July. Relative to the negroes, are they valuable? and could not others be bought for the same amt amount of money that would be more valuable, and yield a better revenue than they would? Sarah's Condition will not advert of his purchasing negroes mainly because they are family negoes, without regard to this efficiency as hands, if she purchases at all, the advantages resulting from that purchase should be the main consideration, and it should be such a one as would

be profitable. If I am correct in my views among this family, Fanny and children, there are several that is of no service at this time and will not be for some time to come, why then purchase negroes from which no revenue can be derived, I suppose one negro would do Brothers probably as well as another, as I presume he is too indolent for any use. Please write me the age & size & appearance of all the family and what you consider the fair value of each one (please get Butler's aid in doing so) and whether you believe they would be worth as much to Sarah the the same amt amount . of money invested in other negroes. My situation is not easy at this moment in consequence of what I stated above, but I can always command money if I should want it, but it worse than useless for Sarah to want property that can not support itself. Write me fully on the subject. I have been corupted corrupted to do a heavy years labor, I have made 680,000 brick and put up a sury surrey as house 45 feet wide & 250 long & cane shed 70 by 100 feet, split out 75,000 boards & made my crop, and raining all the years if you can beat that, Come down & be my neighbor & I believe I could let out one more brick . I have the satisfaction of having a d-m damn fine establishment if it breaks me, besides all this, I have worked hard in assisting to elect my old friend & neighbor Genl General .
