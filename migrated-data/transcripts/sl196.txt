Fayetteville August 7th 1827 Dear Sir, I received your favour favor of the 18th ult. ultimo by about two weeks ago by mail which also brought the first No Number? of your essay on the judiciary. I called upon the editor of the Village Messenger published at this place immediately after receiving it; who says, " The Peoples Friend" shall have a place in his paper regularly, as each No Number is received from Nashville . The first No Number appeared in our paper of last week, the second, which are all that have yet arived arrived at this place, will appear in our next. I was confined three or four days last week by a bilious attack; every symptom of which is, however at length, removed. This circumstance will account for my not having answered your letter sooner; as I was not able to write when the mail left this place for last week for Nashville. The interest you have ever manifested for my wellfare welfare from an early period of our acquaintance encourages me to express my desire, that you would continue to write to me, as often as your leisure and convenience may permit. I have often thought that I would ask of you this favour, but knowing as I did, that your age and health were scarcely equal to the constant attention necessarily required in the management of your business, I have feared, the request might justly be considered unreasonable. I would therefore ask you to write to me only

only when your leisure and health will, without inconvenience to yourself, permit. The good advice for the regulation of my conduct through life, for which I am indebted to you, sanctioned as it is, by your long experience and intimate acquaintance with the World must always be held in the highest respect by me, and will ever be remembered with feelings of gratitude. I am sir very respectfully your friend and humble servant Saml Samuel W Carmack Hon. Honorable John Overton
