Alexa Alexandria ( La Louisiana ) 13 June 1837 Dear Cousin Yours of the 12th May and Cousin Patsy's of a previous date was recd received a few days since announcing to us the untimely death of poor brother Walter , Moore I had heard of it a few days before by Covington Snell & others who I saw at Alexandria on their way to Tennessee (all well,. It was distressing to hear of the decease of Walter leaving a young & promising family, but I was not astonished, I frequently mentioned to him that I thought he drank too much but he never appeared to be aware that he was doing so to his injury, he has by imprudence brought on no doubt a premature death, though I hope as I believe is a fact, that he left his family in a situation by frugality to support itself & educate the children, I hope sister Jane will bear it with fortitude, as we should not grieve at the will of providence the debt is one we have all sooner or later to pay. I am just in from the pine woods this morning left all well but poor little William who has got one of his feet dreadfully burnt, entirely peeled though I am in hopes there will be no deformity Bethiah is fat & John like a guinea pig, Crops generally here are tolerably good some crops of corn are very much injured, mine is seriously

and unless we have rain soon my corn crop must be short I have had but two rains in sixty one days, my Cotten cotton crop is tolerably good though very uneven as the dry weather prevented its coming up at the same time, times have continued very hard, and we can only wish for better as we yet see no prospect of a change, our Banks have all suspended specie payment and can not tell when it will again be resumed, we will be certain of one thing, that is, we shall get nothing for cotten. cotton I am truly sorry that my ill health prevented me from disposing of John & London at Natchez though John could not be sold for any thing like what you would take for him. I have L. he is a much better hand than I thought he was some time ago though damned decietful deceitful , we have not yet had a single sick negro. Thos Thomas Butler left a few days ago for Tenn. Tennessee and was good enough to let us know nothing of it, Bethiah had got some presents to send up by him and tell him she says if he dont don't mind she will tell the secret. We have not heard from Carolina since I left Tenn Tennessee . Write withe news from there & Alabama . Tell Sarah I wrote her some time ago but it seems she did not recieve receive it, but will write her in a few days ( tell her Emily Tumill has married Carson Archinard
