Washington, Wednesday 29th May 1844 My dear Brother, Polk of Tennessee was nominated, a few minutes since, in Baltimore as the Democratic Candidate for President of the United States . They are now calling the roll, by state, in the convention to see whether or not they will all acquiesce unanimously in the nomination. So far as the states have been called they are unanimous and I suppose that no state will withhold her assent ascent . This is the 3rd day since the convention met until about one hour since, the chances seemed to be divided between Van Buren and Cass . Van Buren was withdrawn by his friend attorney Genl Benjm General Benjamin F. Butler , and Polk was soon after nominated. I presume that they will scarcely proceed, to day today , to the Selection of a candidate for vice President. I will, at all events, close, send this to the post officer. The news is communicated by an electromagnetic telegraph, which runs upon wires like electricity.
