Jackson Tenn, Tennessee June 25th 1844 — Dear Papa, This is Tuesday, the day that I promised to write, but I fear that I shall not be able to make any letter very interesting to you. The Children are all well at present, and have been so with the exception of Sam , he had two or three Chills. we broke them upon him by the aid of Quinine and his drain , he is entirely recovered now, and speaks very often about you, when any one troubles him, he threatens to tell his papa . King , as usual cries at night and will sleep with me. The other boys are very busy preparing for their Examination. I think will acquit themselves verry very well, I believe it takes place on next Monday. I wish very much that you could here at that time. Nothing of interest has occured occurred except that the Texas men — They have found a Texas Volunteer Company. Cousin the Captin Captain .

Cousin Jane is to give a small Tea Party tomorrow evening. I can assure you I feel quite delighted at the idea, for this place is rather dull —.

Uncle Will has heard very distressing news about his plantation, that almost the whole of it, is overflowed, Cousin is undecided whether he will go down or not — Mr. Hinds expects to leave of thursday. I believe Cousin Jane's Party is given to him. I suppose ere this, you have arrived at Jonesboro — if so, give our best love to Grand Mama, Aunt Kate & all of our Relations.

Jones has called to see us two or three times. the large stage House that he took away with him did not suit. he was too poor — his Father has not yet called. The Democrats still appear to be in fine spirits about the election they speak of giving a large brand dance down at the "big Spring" on the 18th of July — I think that is one of Uncle Will's propositions. I believe I have told you of everything that has taken place since you left. We are all anxious to hear from you, Write to us often. The Children send their love to you. Aunt Butter's family are all well — they send their love to you — Your affectionate Daughter M J. Mary Jane Chester P. S. Post Script Martha's Music school has not yet commenced
