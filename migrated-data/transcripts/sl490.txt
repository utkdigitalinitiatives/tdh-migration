Cragfont 20th April 1823 Dear Jno I have had the pleasure to receive your favour favor dated at Nashville the 13th instant I know very well that it is important to the prosperity of Memphis that the courts should be kept there, I believe too that powerfull powerful exertions are in embraced to remove them and the propriety and policy of counter acting such exertions and that we must not hesitate at a little expense and trouble to nourish, encourage, and protect our little establishment. You know there is three ways of locating sites for Court houses the first directly by act of the General assembly, the second by Commissioners, and the third by a vote of the people of the county, Now behelst on the spot it will be well for you to ascertain which of them ways the opposition are aiming at, in order to be the better able to frustrate their plans But I still think when they come to fix on a site to rally round in opposition to Memphis, that they well find it a dificult difficult point to agree upon and that many of their forces will desert their cause, Big Creek and the center I expect will be in nomination but surely one but the north west corner of the county will stick to Big Creek the center in my opinion will be found to be the most formidable point to be dreaded by the friends of M_. here all you skill skill skill and persevering industry will be in requisition excited by interest the most powerfull stimulant on earth I have communicated to George Roberts your advice on the subject of his suit with Ring. I will attend at Lebanon on sunday proceeding the Court in order to get a continuance of the Searcy & Eaton suit, but I fear it has been so long hung up in Court, If Seareys counsel presses for a trial that it cannot be effected, and no one understands this case half as well as you do, I wish most sincerely it had been tried at last fall term, even without Smiths testimony rather than at the ensuing term in your absence as counsel. all that can be done however in my power, shall be done, to procure a continuance I am Dear Sir Very respectfully Your obt obedient servant J John Winchester Judge John Overton
