Secretarys office, 6 Oct October 1825 To His Excellency Governor Carroll , Sir, In obedience to a Resolution of the General Assembly adopted at the present session, calling for certain information respecting the school lands laid off or granted in this state, I have to report; That from the plans of the several surveyors districts now deposited in my office, it appears that the surveyors of the second district caused forty eight tracts to be laid down on his general plan, and that seven tracts are in like manner laid down on the general plan of the third district; making in the whole fifty five tracts: The quantity contained in each tract is not specially designated but from a measurement of the lines by the scale laid down they seem generally to include about 640 acres each__ From the plans deposited in my office it does not appear that any school lands were laid down by the Surveyors of the First, Fourth, fifth, or Sixth districts, nor by the surveyor of the district south of French Broad & Holston The plan of the Hiwassee district belonging to my office, has in obedience to a Resolution of the General assembly been delivered to the Entry taker of that district, & there is no document now within my power from which the number of school tracts in that district could be made known.____ Respectfully submitted, David Graham
