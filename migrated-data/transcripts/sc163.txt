It gives me pain to think that the County of Greene so brave on all former occasions should be so slack at a time of such imminent danger_ You will therfore therefore please to send out without delay the remaining part of this number called for in my former order I have the honor to be Sir Your obed. Hbl. Servt. obedient Humble Servant John Sevier Colonel Kenedy
