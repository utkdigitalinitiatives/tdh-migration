Macon , Tenn. Tennessee Sept. September 18th. 1850 Mrs. Mary House , Dear Friend: — In the "Tennessee Organ" of the 14th inst instant which Sarah sent us from school last evening, we see, with painful regret, announced the death of your husband Geo. W. George Washington House We therefore take an early opportunity to write in order to earn from you something more in regard to it — We were pleased to learn he died in the full possession of his mental faculties and ⁁ with of a bright prospect of a blissful immortality. How long was he sick? of what disease did he die? Were any of his relatives from Ala. Alabama present? Where is he buried? Did he ever attach himself to any church When did he join the Sons of Temperance? An answer to these interrogations, together with such other information as you may deem of interest would be thankfully recd received by Mary & me— During the last twelve months I ⁁ have written two letters — the last I ever recd was written some five or six months ago in which he gave an account of a trip which you and he had just

taken to Cincinnati If I am not mistaken I have written twice since I recd this last letter from you — I have been at a loss to account for the silence During the prevalence of cholera in Nashville we often noticed the names of those who had fallen victims to it but never saw any of your family — On one occasion I saw your name given as one of the visitors at ⁁ the springs — Has Tho Haughton left Nashville? — If not how is he doing? We are all in the enjoyment of good health — Our youngest daughter was quite reduced in July, but she is now very healthy. This little creature has a greater resemblance of Geo. House than any other person has I have ever seen — Were you to see her I guess you would concur with me — Mary wishes you, if you have it to spare, to send her a small portion of George's hair — We have a good Female school at Macon taught by Mrs. Miller . She went north and procured two females as assistants — The boarding house is new and large and is kept by Mrs. Miller and husband Rev. Reverend B. Miller a Cumberland presbyterian minister — They

She is permitted to come out the 4th saturday in each month — Mrs. M. Miller is a northern Lady of great intillegence intelligence If you were to notice "M Makin's American Courier" of the 31st Augst August you would find a communication written by a gentleman of our village giving an account of the village — of the Masonic male school, and of this female school Mary sends her love to you & little Sallie — Make our Respects to your mother a hand-drawn hand pointing to "please" Please write me immediately and believe me to be with great Respect Your friend C.
