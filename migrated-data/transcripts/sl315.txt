Gallatin Tenn Tennessee June 27th 1849 Mr Fergusson, Dear Sir: Gen General Trousdale leaves here this morning, (accompanied by Mr. Smith ,) for Sparta , I am very sorry that I have not an opportunity to hear the old soldier, but on account of Cholera we had no speaking here, Gen. Brown is unwell & will not fulfill all the appointments, so Gen. T. Trousdale will take the field by himself for the present, I get most cheering accounts from all parts of the state, The old General's worth is duly appreciated, by true patriotic citizens of Tennessee & he will produce a greater panic in the Whig ranks than that of Cholera, & we can see from the tone of their journals, that they are ala[rmed] considerably, If the Democracy of the State will rouse themselves from unite, themselves, & then am confident of victory, Messrs messieurs Gains & Cullam , I triage to day, Write to the contents to the people, that is if for Democracy Mr. Boyers is at home & will do his duty as editor of the Legion
