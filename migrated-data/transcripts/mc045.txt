Mouth of Sweet Water Apl. April 23rd 1839 Dear Charles I returned yesterday from Chattanooga and found George sick-- he was taken on Friday evening_ Doctor Montgomery was to see him on Saturday_ after which he was much better_ yesterday not so well_ kept his bed_ to day he says he feels a little better & sits up. I have been to see Dr. Montgomery to day_ he thinks G's George's situation dangerous and advised me to send for you_ he will come to see G. so son as he can leave Mrs Charles Toliver whom he considered dying._ The Dr says it is scarlet fever that Geo George has._ he complains of his throat, breast and back. Henry I. left Chattanooga last Thursday morning in fine health & spirits, after purchasing some real estate in the city._ I might probably add something more but that I expect you will come to see Geo. & Ellick can probably tell you the balance Give our love to all the family A.J. Lenoir Chas Charles . F Welcker Esqr Esquire
