Hd Qr Headquarters Western Division St. Louis August 8th 1838 Sir I do myself tthe honor to transmit herewith for your information a copy of a letter which I have just now received from Lt. Lieutenent Colonel R. B. Mason , 1st Dragoons commanding at Fort Leavenworth ; reporting to me the well ascertained fact that the Cherokee Indians of the Arkansas have invited all the chiefs together with all principle Braves of all the tribes (excepting the osages and Kansas ) residing near our western frontier north of the Red river to meet them in council in the cherokee country on the Illionois Illinois river a few miles above the mouth of the Barren fork about the 11th of september next month. The object of the council and the reason for excluding the osages and Kansas, are unknown; but the Lieut Lieutenent Colonel states that there is no doubt in his mind that the object of the council is to effect a union of the different tribes preparatory to striking a simultaneous blow upon the settlements of Arkansas and missouri from the Red River to the upper Mississippi. concuring as I do in this opinion & being convinced that the cherokees of Texas and Arkansas have been instigated by the agents of Mexico , who have been endeavoring for more than two years past to organize a combination of cherokees with all the nations west of Arkansas and the state of Missouri a combination capable of bringing into action upon our frontier

over twenty thousand mounted warriors ___ a force that under enterprizing leaders, would lay waste the whole line of their settlements from the mouth of the sabine to the falls of St Anthony, including the richest cotton growing section of america, on Red river with some of the most valluable sugar Districts of Louisiana if indeed the enemy is suffered to commence the work of destruction before our measures of protection are matured. __ with these impressions I cannot but anticipate authority to concentrate upon the Arkansas frontier a sufficient force to enable me to check the incipient movements of the Indians. five thousand mounted Kentuckyans and Tennesseans added to our present Regular forces, among which is the 1st Regiment of Dragoons (the best I have ever seen) would enable me effectually to thwart the designs of the enemy and givve better protection to the frontier than five times that force would accomplish, after the concentration of the enemy & his successful commencement in his savage work of destruction. I have therefore respectfully to request of your Excellency the promulgation of authority

for the formation of volunteer companies ___ to be organized and held ready to march by the first of september, or as soon thereafter as they shall receive orders ___ to serve the united states six months unless sooner discharged. Should the apprehended combination of most of the different tribes of Indians invited take place, I shall need for the defence defense of the western frontier from three thousand to five thousand men from your state. And I shall hold myself in honor and in duty bound to make every requisite provision for their health and comfort preparatory to meeting the enemy, ___ and above all to afford them every proper opportunity to sustain the chivalry of their state ___ and to take care of the sick & wounded I am with very great respect. Your Excellency's most obedient st servant Edmund P. Gaines major General US Army commanding His Excellency Newton Cannon Governor of Tennessee
