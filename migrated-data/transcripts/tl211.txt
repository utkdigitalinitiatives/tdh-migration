To his Excellency Samuel Houston Governor of Tennessee The Undersigned beg leave to call your Attention to the subject of settling the state boundary line in that part that seperates separates Stuart & Trigg Counties as the Legislature of Kentucky hath passed a resolution on that subject, and as you will be called on by the Executive of that state to cooporate cooperate with him in that business. We with due deference would suggest the following remarks, that owing to a line found having the appearance of Walker's marks. Extending from two miles East of Cumberland to the Tennessee River about two miles North and unconnected with the line run by Walker. As directed by the Government of Virginia from the Southeast Corner of the State of Kentucky. Which reputed line hath been a source of much perplex ⁁ ty perplexity growin growing out of the excercisive exercisive power by the officers of both states over a few inhabitants over which each claim jurisdiction that the Teritory Territory is small Say 18 or 20 Square miles Which we presume of too little magnitude to be regarded as an Object with either state or Counties adjoining and we suppose the Legislature of Kentucky notice the subject with a special view, to the relief of us that is agreed and as we are unable to perceive how survey or that may be appointed by the Chief majistrates magistrates of the two states with the article of Stipulation of the 11th of February 1820 intered entered into by the

commissioners appointed by both States before them can connect those lines with out without doing violence to other parts of the Compact we would further remark that whether those marks north of Walkers general line were made by Walker are title? to the purpose Walker work out to be a strait straight line extending to the Tennessee River this would give uniformity to the boundary between the two States and tranquility to the people immediately interested, With this view of the Subject we would respectfully submit, the following (viz) to wit that in your correspondince correspondence with the Executive of Kentucky You permit him by his surveyors or Survey or" to remark and settle Walkers line from the Southeast corner of Trigg County to the Tennessee River, And where no marks can be found that he shall be governed by the Course of said line. We believe this would be in strict Conformity with the expectation & praise worthy Spirit in which the stipulation was made We under those remarks with feelings & views congenial with that vital self governing principle that so iminently adorns our system of Government Names Names Jsain her Sells mark Thomas G Downs John Acree Wm William C Jones Joshua Sheec Cane Elisha McHain Robert Hamletton Thomas Powell Charles Lamlleton David Churchill James Churchill Thos Thomas S Elliot Enous Outland Nathan Skinner Jowain Champain
