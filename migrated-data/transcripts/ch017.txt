28th. April 1802 Dear Sir, I regret the Unwarrantable transactions which I understand have taken place in your County. You are more exposed to danger in case of an Indian War than any other part of the State, And I am sorry to hear that some of the Citizens Inhabitants by their Conduct seem more disposed to bring on a War than the Citizens of any other place. I do not believe there is any danger yet in your quarter, but if the people persist in their present line of Conduct I cannot Answer for the consequences. The innocent blood that will probably be shed will lie at their door, and they will merit the reproach of every good Citizen. If real danger should occur I shall use every means in my power to protect and preserve the lives and property of my fellow Citizens; But all my efforts to prevent that danger will be rendered Abortive unless the Orderly Citizens take some measures to check that turbulent spirit which seems but too much to prevail in some part of your County. Why cannot a prosecution be commenced against Richmond and Irwin If they are guilty of a Wanton Act in Violation of the laws and treaties they ought to suffer the penalty, and any Barters that have been or may be made that they cannot be taken to Justice, will fail. No man in the state need pretend to be superior to the law, Nor

shall I be deterred from discharging the duties I owe to the State by such empty boasts. If on the contrary they believe themselves Justifiable in killing the Indian, they ought for their own sakes to surrender themselves to the Civil Authority of the State and court an enquiry into the nature of the transaction that their innocence might appear to the World. If such an Enquiry should take place, and they should be found Justifiable if might have a good effect on the minds of the Indians and would remove the impressions which have been made on my mind by the reports in Circulation. I wish to hear from you on this subject and to have a true impartial statement of the case, either supported by Affidavits or in such other form as may be most admissable. Without something of this kind any steps I might take to tranquillize the minds of the Indians would be attended with doubt and uncertainty and might in the end prove injurious. The Judges will be on the road to Nashville in a few days perhaps this might be a favourable favorable opportunity to determine in what manner to proceed in making a Statement of the facts or to procure a warrant if it should be thought proper, and necessary.

The Letter from Mr. B. Blackburn to which I alluded in mine to H Col.o Colonel McKinney stated that the Indian was killed by Richmond and Irwin That the people were much alarmed and requested support in case of danger. That Majr Major Russell was collecting a party to go to the mountains in search of some Indian camps and he was afraid of the consequences. He stated also that frequent Barters were made that the men could not be brought to justice, and concluded with expressing a hope that they would be convinced to the contrary. Mr. Blackburn s Letter is somehow mislaid. I am inclined to believe the information respecting Major Russell was inaccurate as I have not heard any thing of it since A. Archibald Roane
