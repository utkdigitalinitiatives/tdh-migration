Hartsville July 23rd 1839 Dear Sir Having declined visiting you on next Saturday as Col Colonel Polk will not be there I take the liberty to address you a few lines although notwithstanding I have not anything new at present therefore my letter will be short. The intention of this letter is to inform you that on next fryday Friday the candidates have a meeting in this place and I wish you to come down on that day I wish to see you. I expect there will be a good many here on that day and if you will come we will take the visit we spoke of when I was up there. You must be certain to come for I will look for you â€” we are all in a state of health in this country Respectfully W. C. Hamilton
