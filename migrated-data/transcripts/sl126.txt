Shelbyville April 10th / 48 Dear Mother I could not think what was the couse cause of your delay in writing to me, but you will think I have no doubt that I ought to be the last one to complain. Since I last wrote to you I have collected very little that is new or would be interesting to you. If I could express my ideas as prettily as I would wish I would try to comply with your request — after reading a work then is many parts of it may strike me as sublime or beautiful yet I lack words to express my ideas as they ought to be — this prevents me from making an effort. I do not for one moment question the sincerity of your motives & would cheerfully do any thing to gratify you that if I felt competent to do ⁁ so even to commence the profession of law though arduous as it is —

I am sure if I was able or felt that I could accomplish any profession I would have been willing to have attempted it, you know that my thirst for more than a mere pittance would be a very great inducement aside from any other if nothing else It is true I ought to be very thankful that I have health & have been spared thus far without mourning over my condition; their there are many whose situation is much more deplorable than mine. from this thought & the mercies bestowed upon us every day that we live; we ought to be contented in whatever situation we may be placed. I was some what surprised to hear that the folks of Montgomery had me married. I did not think that you would be troubled at all for I am sure if I such had have been the case you certainly would have Known something about it. I would neve never ⁁ have concealed this from you if ther there had been any thing of it —: as you remarked if my purse was large enough I dont Know but what their would be some danger, but the prospect of an enlargement of my purse is so gloomy that I dont think you need be alarmed yet a while. The only thing I regret is that I have all necessary preparations yet to make. It has been reported that the Cholera is in Nashville &

has been for sometime it is nearer than that at least reported to be in Murfreesborough Murfreesboro which is 25 miles from this. The panic has in a great degree worn off the citizens of this place: I have me doubt that if the cholera would make its apperance appearance here that they would all flee to the country for refuge — & desert the place entirely as they done in 38 or when it visited them before A few nights since we had were aroused from sleep by the cry of fire a fram farm house was used for a grocery which stood near the business side of the squre square had taken fire from negligence: the night was storm the wind blew very hard and all the orce on our side took fire. I never saw such a dismal sight. Their was no person that saw the fire but what give up every thing as lost, but by the exertions of the young men principally, the buildings were all saved except the grocery — that we dont miss much. The damage from fire was about twelve hundred dollars. a great deal many goods was stolen & abused very much by moveing moving them out of the stores — No person was injured though their was some very narrow escapes from powder — they were so much excited that several Kegs of powder were scattered about every where & the air filled with fire — but all escaped without harm to any person Theodore A Bell
