Secretary of War, dated, Washington City Mar. 2 1817 I and have no doubt, that, in regard to the general object of Indian civilization culture, the views dispositions of the Executive are in full accordance with those of the Board. It has been with the Board from the first a matter of earnest desire care to deserve to obtain the countenance aid of the government; it is a particular felicity to feel the confidence, that in this it have not failed; and that so long as it shall continue to be duly entitled to this high patronage, it will have no occasion to use solicitation, but only in a fair manner to present its objects its exigencies, in order to secure the help which shall be in the power of the Executive to afford. The attention of the Board in whose behalf I have the honor to act is Especially directed, as you have been apprised, to the four nations of the South West, the Cherokees , Chickasaws , Choctaws , and Creeks .
