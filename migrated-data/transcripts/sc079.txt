KNOXVILLE , January 3rd, 1810 SIR At the last session of the Assembly an act was passed, by which we were appointed Trustees, for the purpose of raising by Lottery a sum of money, not exceeding THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, for the use of East Tennessee College. In discharge of this trust we have devised the scheme of the Lottery; and to aid us, in accomplishing the object in view, we are necessitated to engage those in whom we can confide, in different quarters of the country, to dispose of tickets. — Convinced of your disposition to aid the cause of literature, and satisfied of your punctuality, it readily occurred to us, that we ought to solicit you to undertake the sale of as many tickets as you conveniently can; for the trouble this will occasion we feel ourselves authorized to allow you what will be a reasonable compensation, either in tickets, or in cash, so soon as money can be raised by the Lottery. If you agree to undertake this business you will be pleased immediately to advise us thereof, and the probable number of tickets you can sell. — So soon as we receive your letter, we will forward you the tickets, and likewise a copy of the scheme. The tickets must be sold for cash only. —You will be debited with the amount of the tickets sent at five dollars each, and, upon a settlement, will receive credit for the amount of the money paid us, and the number of tickets you may return. We flatter ourselves that it it will be in our power to sell such a number of tickets as will enable us to commence the drawing in a short time. With great respect, We are your obed't obedient servants, HUGH L. WHITE, THOMAS M'CORRY, JAMES CAMPBELL, ROBERT CRAIGHEAD, JOHN N. GAMBLE.
