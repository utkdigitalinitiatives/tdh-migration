Jackson 4th Feb February 1850 Dear Father your favour favor of 17th ult ultimo was receved received last night and in reply as to Randolph I would say that the best thing that can be done for him is to send him off, to seek his own fortune upon his own exertions, tell him to go to work, learn a trade or whatever else he may desire, that he need not expect any further aid from any quarter, other than his own exertion It is useless to thow throw pearls before swine, I would say to Mr. L that I regret he has given himself and family much trouble about him especially as he has proved u nworthy of the pains that taken with him I hope he will off immedialety immediately to rely upon his I had a conversation Mrs McGehee on the subject of the money Mr Love , it was then understood that along in January a draft would be sent to Mr Love , but I do not know whether or not it has been done, I have written to Mr McGehee ( as he is not at home) on the subject
