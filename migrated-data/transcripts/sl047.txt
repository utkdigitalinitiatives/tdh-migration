Hermitage February 5th 1840 — My dear Sir, I reached home on the 2nd instant on our return, we had to struggle for ten days & nights against the ice on the Mississippi — But the energy of our Captain, Irwin & his noble crew, and the smiles of a kind & gracious providence, we reached Nashville on the first where we were kindly greeted by numerous friends, and the whole Legislature in a body, and I am now reclining under the peaceful roof of the Hermitage with my dear little family, with improved strength tho though labouring laboring under a bad cold taken on board the boat amidst the Ice, and somewhat increased since I got home by a little imprudence. I had the pleasure of meeting with my old friend father Gwin, in good health, — but disatisfied dissatisfied with the lower country — has a wish to return & spend his last days in Tennessee if it meets the views of his wife, to whom he wrote by me — I made him an offer of Wards place, now owned by me son &

myself, which the Doctor, William Gwin said if his father selected, he would buy for him — I enclosed the letter to Mrs Gwin , requesting to know her determinations as yet I have not heard from her. To have this good old man my neighbour neighbor in my declining life would be a great pleasure to me. If Mrs. Gwin desires to return below, then my dear friend, I wish your aid in procuring a purchase of that fine track of land for us — My sons situation is such that we must sell and any individual who can advance five thousand dollars or four thousand can now have a great Bargain in that tract of land — It can be had, now, with an advance of $5000 — for fifteen thousand dollars, and the ballance balance at one two & three years without interest — if not punctually paid, interest from the date, this to induce punctuality. and on an advance of six thousand dollars, it can now be had for fourteen — thousand dollars, with the above credit & conditions — Would not any one who has mony money by buy such an investment

⁁ shake fifty percent in a few years, yea, the moment the present pressure passes away this tract will command thirty dollars per acre. This I will know, but a little imprudence has caused this necessity, and I would always sacrafice sacrifice property, than the credit of my adopted son or myself, therefore the sacrafice sacrifice of this fine tract is to be made — would not Col Colonel Elliott invest his mony money in such a certain & sure profit as this purchase would ensure — My dear Sir, furnish me a purchaser on the above terms & the premium offered will be yours. This sale will free us from debt — and the fine plantation below will pay for itself & meet a surpluss surplus and my Hermitage must sustain my expence expense — I will live within my means, & my son from his paid for expence expense , I am sure will never be indebted again when clear of his present dificulties difficulties — Therefore my dear Sir it is that I am so solicitous to make the sacrafice sacrifice & sale of the land to get him clear of debt & myself from his liabilities. Have the goodness to write

me soon, and inform me of the prospects of a sale, or of any offers made where an advance of five or six thousand dollars will be made — Should your business lead you to Nashville call & give me a night — with my kind regards and that of my little family to you and yours expecting in due time the promised visit of you & family. I remain your friend. Andrew Jackson The Revd H. Reverend Herdy M. Cryer — The Revd. H. Reverend Herdy M. Cryer near Gallatine Gallatin Sumner County Tennessee
