Memphis July 23rd 1847 Dear Niece. When I was writting writing to your Father the thought struck me why cant can not I write a letter to Mary , for I suppose she would like to hear from her Uncle Ben and how her Old Friends in Memphis were getting along. I will now put my thoughts in words and try to write her a letter. I suppose you are enjoying yourself among the beautiful Hills of Ct. Connecticut where you can see (I imagine ) the streams winding thier their way among the undulating banks and as they glitter in the sunbeams you can behold the ripening fields of Wheat waving thier their golden grain to the breeze and the deep green fields of Indian corn fluttering thier their green blades to the light wind. And above the rosy clouds as they float in thier smilling their smiling beauty, tinged with the golden hues of the Evening, reflect upon the summits of the Hills around you thier their glittering colors. rather imaginary While I am revelling not exactly in the Halls of Montazeuma Montezuma , but in the Hall of Ploughs & Points where I cannot behold such beautiful scenery, but that long Row of Buildings commonly called Front Row presents itself to my eye. I reckon you would like to see that scenery but I wont try to make you homesick. We all get along very well but me, I have been sick most all

the time scince since you went away. I am just able to get about now I am takeing taking Medicine now and all I take leaves me just about as it finds me. I am at the Office now Called the Plough Hall as our Ex. Executive Committee meets here once sometimes, and " by the by " I must tell you about our grand Temperance Celebration on the 5th of July . We met at our Church at ½ past 8 o clock where all recieved thier received their badges which were of Blue Satin Ribbon with "Cold Water Army" on them Each Officer had the Office he held with a star like yours on his badge. We also had a new banner which I will try to describe to you. It was made of Bleached Domestic put on quite a large frame. Our Motto was " Liberty and Temperance " p r inted in a Semi Circle, then a jug bottom up, under which were the Flags of Liberty and Temperance crossed & then "Cold Water Army". The staff was about 1 foot & ½ above the Banner Where floated a small silk Flag the "Stars and Stripes long may they wave O v 'er the Land of the Free & home of the brave." drawing of flag and banner described above We then formed into a procession & marched to Court Square from there to Madison St Street , down Front Row to the Church again, where as soon as all were seated Iced Lemonade was handed around to all in the house. The Exercises were then opened by a prayer from Rev. Reverend Mr Dennis . Benj'n Benjamin N Sawtell was then introduced to the Assembly who read the

Declaration of Independence. Mr G. Stainback then addressed the Assembly in a fine speech. Mr Alonzo Harper ( Ed knows him) also delivered an excellent speech Then came our Dialouge Dialogue continued & 2 characters introduced Farmer Jenkins an Old Toper by Bungan Miller Lawyer Doolittle thinking some about joining the pledge by William Cotter . I made a speech & converted them both Every one knew his part first rate. We then stepped to the Front of the Stage, all took off our Hats & President Phoebus made a few remarks inviting the Audience to join us. The Pledge was circulated and 100 persons enlisted in the "Cold Water Army". The Audience were there dissmissed dismissed , but the members went into the Lecture Room, where the badges were collected, and then we drank Lemonade with a vengeance You ought to have seen Tom, Bob, Bungan, Billy , myself & others drinking Toasts with the Young Laides Ladies , "Oh I wish you & Ed had been here". I was congratulated by a great many on making 2 new converts. The Lemonade was made by Mrs Doctor Means , Miss Harriet Miller & others. Tell your Father We did not have any Wheel Horses nor did we need any, for the Old Folks say they could not have done it any better themselves Mr Henderson praised us a heap &, said he was proud of us "Oh we are some ". The Society paid all the expenses of the day banners, badges, & all, The Officer's gave about $12.00. There is money in the Treasury now

We have an Election the 31st of July . The Girls want to make me President but the Boys say I must be Secretary agin again as there is no one that understands it but me. But let me what I may I am for the good of the Cause I must say a little something about the other Society, Saml Samuel Brown is President It is (I am sorry to say) in not a very flourishing condition. they have an Election before long when thier their 6 months is out. We are going to have Lycurgus Gabbert Pres't President & he is going to make it a life time Society & soon we will all be together. We are going to have a Branch of the "Cold Water Army" organized in South Memphis . But I reckon I have said enough about Temperance Society's Societies but when I get a going it is hard to stop. I will tell you something about our Branch Sunday School in North Memphis (Pinch) organized soon after you left. Mr Johnson is superintendent, Yon Phoebus is Librarian, I am a Teacher I have 5 scholars We have about 60 in all. Sally sends all her love to you & Ed, she wants to see you so bad She has not been very well long back but is getting better now.
