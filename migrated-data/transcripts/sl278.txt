(Private) Nashville , T. Tennessee Oct. October 21, 1835 . Dear Sir, Your several communications of the 28th and 30th ult ultimo and of the 1st. inst. instant together with your letter for publication, have all been duly received, and shall be confidentially attended to as desired. Your communication for the Union has been given to the public as you will have seen. The further course I shall take in relation to the matter of the franks, and the new remarks of the Banner, you will see next week. The papers will inform you of the progress our new General Assembly is making in the business of President making. What they will do with Ridley 's resolutions, now lying on the table of the House, specifically approving severally of the leading measures of the administration, and of the conduct of the President separately in relation to each, yet remains to be seen. These resolutions are framed with a special view of having a distinct vote taken in relation to each important measure. It will be a sore pill to some hypocrites and some apostates to be forced to vote in that way, but they will be compelled to do it or disgrace themselves by giving the go by, in some way, to the whole in a mass. — In debate, we have decidedly the advantage of talents. Nicholson , Col. Colonel Polk 's convert from the last remains of Whiteism, is a great accession to us. Guild is a man of good sense a bold generous fellow — but who, by the by something manifests more

courage than discretion. In Ridley, Humphreys ( a son of the Judge and member from Fayette ) and Turney we have men equal to the ablest of the enemy. Some of their best men, don't go the whole — Carnthers for instance. In the Senate, Craighead — and ⁁ I rather hoped for than expected it — is taking good ground. But even up to this time, it is very much undecided how a good many respectable members will finally stand on the great questions which now agitate the state growing out of the Presidential controversy. Matters on hand, as they arise, which you would not learn from the papers, I will communicate in such hasty letters as I can find time to write at least once or twice a week. Tomorrow, the people of Maury are to give Col. Polk a dinner at Mooresville . Mr Grundy started out as a guest on yesterday, and is to make a speech. I have besought ⁁ him as with tears to cry aloud and spare not. The time has actually arrived here now, when, as Mr. G. Grundy said of the sword in his war circular of 1812, "cursed is he that keepeth back himself from the fight, or holdeth back his means." That we will win the day next year I feel no reasonable fears, but ⁁ it will be by a hand fought battle. Bell admitted in a conversation with Falls of the Mississppian, a few weeks since, that unless they can unite all branches of the opposition in the support of Judge White next winter, their case will be gone and hopeless. The ackowledgement was not made confidentially, and I urged Falls to use

it in Mississippi when he got home. What he may be able to make out of it, or what course he may take in relation to it, I do not know. There will be a strong necessity, in order to aid us here, of running Col. Polk for speaker, if it can be done with the wishes of our party. In correspondence which I have had with Gov. Governor Reynolds and Col. May of Illinois , I find that the delegation of that state have the matter much at heart. This correspondence was sought by Gov. R. Reynolds with a view of consulting our friends here. He informed me that he had written to Mr. Blair on the subject. I wrote also to Mr. Blair but have received no answer. I am entirely sure that Shields , Huntsman and Dunlap of our delegation will all go with Johnson in supporting Polk against Bell. In Illinois, at least one paper two papers — the Springfield Republican and St. Clair Gazette — have avowed their preference for Col. P. as has been ⁁ also done by the Democrat, if not others in Alabama . The Albany Osgers , I think, gives an intimation in its remarks on Col. Polks speech of June last. This, however, is a weighty matter which can only be adjusted after our friends get to Washington . It is a matter, however, of great importance here, for we now feel certain that if Bell finds he can't beat Polk himself, he is determined to try to have it done by another, and he would like to have that other to be one of our friends. When such men as old Peteray here, who knows Bells' plans as far he would divulge them to such a man, as ⁁ is told by our friends that Polk can ell, he always takes a pinch of snuff, and ntly asks, if

Polk can beat Mason . That he intends it ⁁ the remark as an answer, and not as asking a question, is certain. Please present my kindest respects to the President, and to Col. Earl and for yourself, Accept assurances of my highest respect and esteem S. H. Laughlin . Oct 21st 1835 Maj. A. Major Andrew J. Donelson. PS. Post Script In my rambling letters, written at snatches of time during the sitting of the Assembly, when I have to report and copy documents and twenty other extra things for our papers, as well as for other friends, you must excuse the most hasty scribling scribbling L Laughlin Maj.
