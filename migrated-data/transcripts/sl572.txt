Bellview 15th Feby February 1818 Gentlemen Your favor of the 6th Inst instant by my son Brian, was recd received in due time, but was not answered by his return to Cairo , quiry query to other & prossiry possible engagements. I now avail myself of the oppty opportunity to inform you, that the explanations given in that letter, respecting my son__ is satisfactory. and I repeat my wish for him to continue in your service. We hear that about 1200 Volunters Volunteers appeared at Fayettville , for the purpose of proceeding to the south. Their commander ( Col Colonel Hayns) declared, he knew not their destination. we also hear, that a large force go from the cherokees __ on the same expedition. That this force is intended to act agst against Florida , is inforced enforced on the mind by a combination of circumstances, which with me leaves no doubt on the subject. Our court of pleas & quarter sessions is organized under the late act of assembly (members) Wilson Cage __ Richd Richard Alexander __ Patrick M Erhern __ William Haney , & Branch Nunly . The three first named are good assts assistants __ the others might have been lecttured lectured However upon the whole, we have done pretty well, and I anticipate much good to result from it. Hoping that any defeats which experience may discover in the system, will be provided for by the next genl general assembly. I am glad

that the directors of the U United States bank have determined to send a branch to Nashville The resolution of Our legislature to the contrary not withstanding. I am also glad that that the people are well disposed to recieve receive it. Should this inquir the profits of the state banks. What is that to you, or me, or the people gennerally generally I say nothing provided a better is substituted__ and that it will be better, I believe now am prepared to deny. a gentleman late from Huntsville say that, at the late sales of public land there, it averaged $48 per acre and the best not yet sold. If this be true, it baffles a conjecture. Congress has at last discharged Col Colonel John Anderson from confinment confinement , with a repremand reprimand . This mans tenacity opened a new and wide field for the display of congressional eloquence, & learning__ and which has been well improved. altho although much time has on this subject been occupied, which might have been usefully employed in attending to the great concens concerns of the nation, It may nevertheless be considered well spent, as it has probably settled that principle forever. Our family are in health, hoping you & yours are enjoying the like blessing. I say blessings, because it may justly be ranked among the greatest which this state of existance existence affords, and is necessary to sustain all the risk. without it, life is an unplea
