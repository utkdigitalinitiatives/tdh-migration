Knoxville March 14th 1799 My good Sir, I received your letter of the 6th January yesterday for which I thank you much — my brother thanks you for your kind remembrance of and expressions of friendship towards him — He accepts with pleasure your congratulation on his last election, and wishes for his welfare — the assembly has been called since his election and he was elected Speaker of the Senate — he now enjoys good health which he wanted when you were here — Since the date of your letter the Senate of the U. S. United States have decided on the impeachment, which you have or will have seen before this reaches you — it seems that eleven Senators voted for the impeachability!!! ignorance of the Constitution must be fashionable where they live — I am glad to find that no one of the eleven lives Southward or westward of Maryland — The clamor raised against you for publishing certain paragraphs is founded in folly and must terminate in their disgrace — ignorant nincompoops, they must be greatly hide bound —— I suppose the last treaty made with the cherokees is ratified before this, and of course is or soon will be published — Those people who had been removed off their farms by the military while you were here have since the treaty returned to their homes — I am not sensible of any change in the political sentiment in Tennessee — many people did not remove to this state last year — lands are not in very great demand — In the recess of Congress Mr Jackson received the temporary appointment of Judge in place of H. Tatum resigned, Genl. General Smith had the temporary appointment in place of Jackson — at the meeting of the legislature Jackson's appointment was confirmed, Smith's was not, Cocke was elected to succeed Anderson and Anderson to succeed Smith — On the arrival of Genl. General Smith at this

place, he was invited to partake of a dinner given him by the citizens of the town and its vicinity — a handsome address was presented him, and his answer was a good one — The General is a man of worth and talents — I suppose you have heard before this that Judge Campbell who was impeached by the House of Representatives of this State was acquitted by the Senate the votes were six against him, four for him — G. Cox was arrested by the military at Natchez last August and confined a considerable time, without knowing as he says the cause of his arrest, he made his escape, went to Orleans , thence to Nashville by way of Mobile — he arrived at Nashville on Sunday and that night he was arrested by the Deputy Marshall who acted under the authority of a writ or warrant issued by Judge McNairy — He has been bound over to appear at Nashville from time to time under an expectation that charges would be brought forward against him from the Natchez if any there are three months and more have elapsed since he came to Nashville and no charges yet, made known — perhaps he may be released shortly. I think it is hardly worth while to hold a man to Jail when he is not charged with having committed any offence — He has published a pamphlet showing his views and containing of his treatment during his imprisonment — it is too large to pay postage on or I would send it you — Bennet and Robert Searcy were both married during my stay at Nashville to Miss Polly and Betsy Windle all of whom you have an acquaintance with — Hugh L. White is married to a daughter of Mr. Carrick our preacher — John Crozier is married to a Miss Barton who lived near Winchester — I suppose time will produce little Bennets, Roberts, Hughs and Johns — I think with you that it is time you and myself had gotten some shemale sleep mates — how do you come on in that

way? I am not any nearer than when I saw you — friend Moses I pray you not to marry a yankie yankee girl — I do very much wonder how you can reconcile it to your feelings to continue in that cold part of this world — it would afford me great pleasure to have you for a neighbour neighbor in Tennessee where you can write all the winter ⁁ without the ink freezing in your pen — I feel myself much indebted you for your last letter taking the coldness of the weather into view — I had an opportunity of forwarding your letter to Capt. Captain Williams the day after I received it, which opportunity I embraced — I think I have seen the best specimens of the yankie yankee race and could name some whom I much esteem, but there are some again who I think and know to be mere tackies and I am of the opinion that you ought not to stay longer in the country which those illthriven ill-thriven chase inhabit than to settle your business — I have it not in power to say any thing about the deed you mentioned, know I will communicate — No charges having been exhibited from Natchez against G. Cox he was (as I am just told by one of his securities) on the 25th of last month discharged and his securities released? My Sister's arm is not yet well but very much better, I hope time will it — her Mamma came from North Carolina with her — John Chisholm arrived here the day before yesterday — La? requested by my brother and his lady, also by Billy who is reading to present to you their most respectful compliments, and good wishes for your wellfare welfare — I am as usual Your friend Willie Blount to Moses Fisk Esqr. Esquire
