Knoxville Jany January 8th 1841 To His Excellency Jas James . K. Polk Sir I am instructed by the Major General of the 1st division, to report to you the number and kind of public arms deposited here, from an examination, made by the Assistant Quarter Master General and myself. There are 1280 U.S United States . Musket, with their accompanyments accompaniments __ 34 Broad Swords, (many of them damaged by rust). and 20 Carbines, and these are all the public arms here. We did not open the boxes containing the arms, because we supposed it would injure them to do so, and besides we were satisfied of their contents, from this, that there were 64 boxes, all of the same size, and nearly all of them were marked as weighing 316 lbs pounds __ and a great many of them were marked "20 Muskets" hence we inferred that there were 1280 Muskets, and this corresponds with a letter from Genl General . N. Smith to Col Colonel . Churchwell in which he stated that he had forwarded to Knoxville , that number of muskets. all the other boxes (with two exceptions), were of a larger size, all alike and marked "Accts," one of them being open contained cartridge boxes, bayonet

scabbards, with their scraps, and these boxes must contain the accountements accountants belonging to the Muskets__ The two boxes mentioned as exceptions, were open, and one contained 34 broad iron scabbard swords, or sabres, & the other contained 20 smoothed bored guns, which I have above demoninated Carbines__ This communication is ordered principally because several Companies of Cavalry have made application so the Majr Major . Genl. for swords pistols, &c and et cetera which are not here, and believing that a portion of such arms are due to this Division if a proper distribution was made, it is therefore hoped that your Excellency will forward to Knoxville all such arms as this Division may be enstilled instilled to as early as practicable,__ you will thereby greatly oblige the Volunteer Corps' of this Division and particularly Yr Your Respectful & obt obedient .
