Harnageville Ga Georgia 13th April 1832 Dear Charles When reflecting on the many interesting Events that happened during my residence in Athens those in which You was an actor or participant creates some of the most Lively & pleaseing pleasing recollections, and an my part they have sealed a Friendship which I trust will be as Lasting as my Life, I have often thought of writing You, but the Lack of something to interest or amuse You has invariable induced or rather compeled compelled me to postpone it, and Even now You must not suppose I am in a better situation, Indeed I am a citizen of Harnageville the Lawful capital of Cherokee County Ga Georgia and that I am doing very Little professional business, for at Least one of the strongest reasons in the world is there there is very little to do, I am in hopes however the time is not for distant when I may have better news, The survey of the Cherokee nation has commenced and is now going on,

a lottery for the disposition of the lands will take place it is expected so soon as the survey is completed, which will be in the course of 3 or 4 months, and will be settled this fall and winter without the interposition of the General Government, The Indians will remain undisturbed in their actual improvements , In them they will be protected, Georgia pays & intends to pay no respect to the decision of the Supreme Court in the Missimary case, they are Let in the penitentiary, But Enough of this, I fear it is to be the mother of discord, nay it is that already; of something worse, Then let us turn to the consideration of something which is all harmonious and beautiful; something that claims the calmest deliberations of our minds and the warmest affections of our hearts, It is that upon which depends our happiness here and our Eternal happiness or misery hereafter, Surely then it is something that deserves our earliest our highest consideration, It is that which prepares us to meet God in peace; the Religion of Jesus Christ, I ask myself the solemn question "have I that Religion, I trust I have, Yes I thank God for the hope which he has given me in his son, "the lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world" that I have tasted of the Heavenly gift, & been made a partaker in of the Holy Ghost & the powers of the world to come,
