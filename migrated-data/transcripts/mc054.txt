Knoxville Tennessee Jan. January 5th 1839 Brother Charles, I could not procure any Clover seed, there being none in this place. The merchants think a sufficient quantity can be purchased before time for sowing them. Horses are dull sale hire here , I can hear of no one wanting to buy I will send in this your money and a ten dollar bill to Henry, which he sent by me to Col, Colonel R, White . I did not see him. I could not get John M Duffie 's business done in time to send by Ham ; if he enquires concerning it tell him when I have gotten the cetificate certificate I will envelop the writeings writings and send them by mail. James M. Monroe Welcker
