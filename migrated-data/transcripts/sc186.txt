Pulaski May 8th 1840 Ever dear and beloved Cousin Your interesting epistle dated the 25th was received a few days go, and it is with much pleasure that I now hasten to answer it, though I must tell you at the commencement that I know of nothing very interesting or answering to write but I shall at least attempt to entertain you for a few minutes, though I fear I shall fail to do so. Oh! Jane how much I wish you were here to converse with me face to face, instead of being writing to you for I have so so much to tell you if I could see you, that I cannot write. Would you not prefer being in our little village enjoying yourself with us instead of being confined at school with those dry studies; yes I know you would. Mr Mister & Mrs Misses Knox, Gene Crockett , and Mary Park , are now with us, and you cannot imagine what fine times we have. We had a party on Sunday, and are to have another on tonight and three or four next week. Do you not think that this is doing very well for our little town the population not exceeding 1600 inhabitants.

You cannot imagine how many leave the girls here. Since they have been staying at Mrs. Aderms the house has been more like an inn than a private house. Jane has taken in the Hon Honorable EJ Shields , and Maury the handsome and dignified Cou Count Leathermen, and a dozen others too numerous to mention Jane how did you hear of May day. I do not think I ever enjoyed myself so much in my life. We had no Queen, but a delightful fire-one party in the woods. We were gone all day, and had our dinner sent to us; returned to town late in the evening, and had a party that night. Jane did you ever hear of so many marriages in your life. I declare it beats bob tail. I expect by this time Hate Hearney is a married man; we received a letter from him a few days ago, and he was to start the next day for his license. I believe he is to be be united in the silken hands of matrimony to Miss Mary Harris of Vicksburg . I am not going to believe it until I hear that he is married He is always going to be married but never makes it out, at least has not heretofore. You wish to know what had become of Dave Reynolds . Did you not know that he was married He was married to Mary Abernathy (cousin Oscar's old sweetheart) before I left Nashville I tell you what these college chaps "beats all nature" dont they? They pretend to love mighty hard at first but they very soon get over it Tom Brown , and Alf Albernathy are still here but they go by the appellation of the Exclusives. There have been several college boys here lately, and amongst them was little Billy Pikes

Were you not acquainted him. He was wonderfully taken with Eliza Jane Brambitt . But it is time for me to stop with my foolishness, as I have not time to write anymore now, as I have no less than four more letters to write this morning. Jane answer this soon if you please and Jane be sure to come home this summer. Give my love to all the girls, and believe me your Sincere Friend & cousin Sarah Bet
