The last letter I had from James spoke of a good school a Winchester and if that is the fact I had determined not to change his position until I sent him to Princeton, Ky. Kentucky The Cumberland College or the University of Nashville _ The Other little boys can do better here during the Winter Season than at any other point and next spring I may make some arrangements to send them up the country_ If the school of
