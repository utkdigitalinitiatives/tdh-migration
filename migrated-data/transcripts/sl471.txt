Tellico Blockhouse April 10th 1796 Sir A letter from Governor Blount to me of the 10th Instant contains this paragraph "Contingent expences expenses will unavoidably occur "such as the the public good will require to be submitted to and in "such cases you will make them known to the Agent of the Depart"ment of war whose duty it will be to provide accordingly." One of the principal articles of expence will be provisions and some whiskey for such chiefs or other cherokee s as may visit me at this place on public business the uncertainty of the time of such visits and the distance from this to Knoxville will point out the necessity of some person being here whose duty it will be to furnish such supplies to my order as may be indispensably necessary__ Will you oblige me with a line on this subject? I am with due respect Your obedient Servant John McKee Col D. Colonel David Henley Agent Dept Department War
