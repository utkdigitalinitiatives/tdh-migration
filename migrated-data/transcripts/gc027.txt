Alexandria La Louisiana , 24 Feby. February 1834 Dear Cousin I had the pleasure of bringing Sarah from Henry Overton s on the 9th inst. instant where she arrived in safety and good health and is very much pleased with Loua. Louisiana I would have written you sooner but on the day of my arrival home with sister found that three of my negroes had run away and as they had went off without any cause the presumption was they were endeavoring to get back to Carolina I accordingly pursued the route they came, but I was entirely decieved deceived they were caught six or eight days since making their way to Texas had gotten within fifty miles of the Sabine , failing to take the near route. I have given them a dose & put them to work this morning. I have an immense quantity of heavy labor to do before I can plant my cotton crop. am now ready to plant my corn ‚ÅÅ a great many others have finished. I shall put in one hundred acres in corn and am pushing hard to get three hundred in cotton on the prospects for a good price next season is flattering should the Bank question be settled by Congress

I have still the larger portion of my Crop unsold and fear that I have refused a better price than I shall obtain as the pressure in the money market in N. New Orleans is at this time very great, the U Bank has a great many friends who are large Capitolists Capitalists and they strain every nerve to oppress the people that they may be favorable to a recharter and a return of the Deposites Deposits niether neither of which I hope will ever be effected. I herein enclose you thirty dollars the amount loaned to Sarah and am much obliged to you for your Kindness. tell Cousin Martha I have her pecans but have seen no person by whom I could send them but will by the first opportunity also a sack of Mexican seed, should no unexpected accident occur & I should not get too money hungry I shall be in Tenn Tennessee in 1835 I expect to leave for the City in a few days where I shall be a week or two. negroes are falling, should I not accept an offer that has been made me in Orleans I shall have to get you to purchase me a blacksmith they ask for one in the city who is a complete master of his trade $2000 I think it probable I shall take him, Sarah & wife joins me in love to all yr. afftc your affectionate Cousin Tho. Thomas O. Moore
