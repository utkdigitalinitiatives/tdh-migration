James Knox Polk , Democrat, Governor of Tennessee , 1839-1841, was the first college graduate to fill the Governor's chair in the State. He was born in Mecklenburg County, N.C., Nov. 2, 1795; was of Scotch-Irish descent, the original family name being Pollock . He was graduated from the University of North Carolina with first honors, 1818, and it is said that while in college he never missed a single recitation or duty. This habit followed him, and during his long term in Congress he was never absent a single day from the House. 1806 his father moved to Tennessee and on leaving college James K. came also. He studied law under Felix Grundy , and was admitted to the bar 1820. In 1821 he was chief clerk of the State Senate, and 1823 was a member of the House of Representatives from Maury County . He helped to elect Andrew Jackson to the United States Senate at this session. He was a member of Congress 1825-1839, and was speaker of the House 1835-1839. He defeated Newton Cannon , the Whig candidate for Governor, 1839 and at the two succeeding elections, 1841, 1843, he was defeated by James C. Jones , the representative of the Whig party. 1844 Polk was elected President of the United States over Henry Clay , Jackson's political enemy, but he failed to carry his own state. Polk's administration as Governor is unimportant while his presidency is crowded with interest. The Mexican war was fought, the Oregon controversy peacefully settled. He retired to private life in Nashville at the close of his term; died June 15, 1849, and is buried on the Capitol grounds.
