Lawrenceburg Feby February 18th 1844 __ Private Messrs Hogan & Heiss Gentlemen: Some of the friends of Hon. Honorable A. V. Brown , are disposed to complain that his two speeches on the Jackson fine, and the abolition questions, have not been republished in the Union__ I myself thought they had been published, though I may be mistaken. If they have not been I hope you will give them an insertion in your paper as early as practicable Brown is a prominent member of our party__ and may feel wounded (and I have on intimation that he probably does so) at the failure to republish what he says in Congress. in the Tennessee Democratic papers and especially in the Union.__ If you have omitted it, in this instance, I have no doubt it has been accidental. I am here attending Court, but expect to visit Nashville in about a week from this time.__ Respectfully Your friend James K Polk
