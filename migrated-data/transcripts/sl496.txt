New Orleans 19 Feby February 1823 General Winchester dr dear Sir The cash advances required of us shall be cheerfully made and in the way desired. We seriously regret to hear that you are again dealing in the article of Tobacco, because it has long been a loosing business to those who been engaged in the traffick traffic , and now presents a more gloomy prospect than it had even yet done within our recollection__ The stock on hand abroad is unusually larger__ the demand small indeed and rates wonderfully reduced __ here there is remaining of the old crop, fully three thousand hogsheads, the new crop arriving, the price at least one cent pr per pound larger than it was last year at this time, and no possibility of selling readily even at low prices and on very extensive credits. Cotton affords some inducement to the investors of funds and we recommend it to your consideration exclusively__ it is in command of 9 C cents 91/2 for Tennessee

and alabama , with on return demand and in cash payments__. Surely it presents a more alluring prospect to dealers than Tobacco does. No other article of Western produce deserves notice, and those who do trust them will experience a losing business. It becomes our painful duty to announce the loss of the S.R Tennessee __ on her to voyage hence to Louisville at half past 9 oclk O'clock on the night of saturday eigth eighth instant, she unfortunately struck a Sarryen in the Mississippi river about two hundred miles above natchez and sunk immediately__ there were about 180 passengers abourd on hand who succeeding in effecting their escape, with the exception of 30 drowned, without luggage or anything else__ We are encouraged by the opinions of some experienced pilots to expect a recovery of her Engine at low water, and some suppose that the Rout may be regained The loss is really a sore one, but we are

bearing it in a manly way and are driving on in business__ our audit is not effected here by any means, and if we can retain the confidence of our friends in the wish all will progress well. many persons hearing of the disaster, and on whom we had no claims of the kind, came forward and generously offered their friendship and some the extent of their credit Respectfully yours Breedlove, Bradford & Robison
