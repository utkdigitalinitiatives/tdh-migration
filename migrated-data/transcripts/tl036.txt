Knoxville 5 March 1797 Brother No. Number 4 1797 Recorded Your letter of the 4th came to hand to day today , in which You Say that your people have done no damage on either the property person or property of any the whites. Man I wish this was the case, and I make no doubt but you think so, but you may be sure, several is killed one in powels Powell Valley by a fellow called Dick , can talk some english English , who has hunted there and was , and is well known by the people ; can talk some english English , Letter to the Indian chiefs 1797 I mention this that You may know the person, there has also been a great Many horses taken from cumberland Cumberland and one Man killed And Another Wounded, there And yesterday another Was killed and scaulped scalped on place little pigion Little Pigeon about thirty miles from this place, this This conduct my brother has a bad appearance and as I told you before will be attended with disagreable disagreeable events Should your people be so foolish And unwise Not to decline Such practices. You mention that I wrote you in a threatning threatening Manner, but my brother if you listen to the Words of my letter, there is no threats in it. , I have only spoken to you the language of truth, and the fatal consequences, that Must attend your Nation , should you be so imprudent As to again go to War I dont don't nor never did

2d Speak to you with a false toungue tongue , nor do I wish your people to be treated ill, but on the contrary that they may live in peace and safety and raise their children in Quietude I know very well, that some of our the white people are bad men and have been guilty of a horrid Crime in killing the red bird Red Bird and Will , and I expect that when ever whenever they can be taken they will shall suffer for it, one of them has run away and the other as yet is not taken; as I told you in my last I tell you in this, that the innocent ought not to suffer for the guilty, neither ought your people to take Any Satisfaction until you had first made your complaint And stated your sufferings. It is impossible for me to know when damage is done to your people without you inform me; and your own good sense will point out to you that A Murderor Murderer seldom ever discovers upon himself, which I Suppose is the reason why your people denies they have done any Mischeife Mischief You say you have been a long Journey and While at philadelphia Philadelphia received very different talks from that of mine; and say that I say you are but a handful of people and in consequence of our superior ity in Numbers Suppose we have aright a right to do as we please I deny saying we had aright a right to do as we please on any such a supposition, neither is there any such a word in any letter

3 it is true I said you were only a handful of people, which is the truth and I also advised you of the danger of going to war ; If the people at philadelphia Philadelphia have told you that you were are a Numerous and strong people, and that you ought to go to War and kill your white brothers, they have not told you that which is true, nor that which would be for your good and the interest of your nation was you to take such advice . I spok what I said in my letter was to convince your nation of their danger and the Great evils that always attend a war, and the distressing condition your people would be in, Should Such a thing take place You say that you Wish I would talk to My people and tell them not to cross the River Tennessee Tennessee River or to survey your land I have often told them that, neither do I wish or intend any such thing should be done. But you know I am agreat a great Way from that place, and cant can't See what every foolish Man is doing, I expected that the gaurds guards at Tellico , and your own would stop such people from Crossing Over, and I Suppose, they Would was they to see them, but neither them nor myself can see the transaction of every bad man, no More, then than you can your people, who come over on our side And kill our people and steal our horses. Now brother I hope I have Said enough to convince You, that I dont don't Wish our people and yours to go enter into War against each other, and I hearby hereby declare that

I wish us to live friendly and bury all Anemosities Animosities deep in the earth, If you have complaints, the government will redress them, and you know they are taking measures to effect the same, but if your people will undertake contrary to the treaty Articles of the treaty to redress themselves, you cant can't expect the government will do it I request that you will make enquiry into the murder lately done on pigion Pigeon ; and if You can possible have them the murderors murderers punished agreably agreeably to the Articles of Treaty. your people could have no color of excuse for committing Any depredations on that Quarter for they are not on lands claimed by your Nation, Neither have they interupted interrupted Any of your people I hope to have an answer from you as soon as possible Your friend J.
