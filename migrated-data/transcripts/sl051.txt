Cerokee Cherokee Agency 6th July 1816 Sir, I was at the city when the conversation with the Cherokees was made settling their boundary line: The Secretary of War at that time made a proposition to the Cherokees then there as a deputation, to cede to the U United States all their claims to lands lying west of a line to be run due south from that point on the Tennessee river which intersected by the Eastern boundary of Madison County to the line agreed upon by the said conversation. The Cherokee Deputation did not consider themselves authorised authorized to cede land. Before I came away the Secretary told me that a treaty would be ordered to be held in order to obtain some cessions of land from the Cherokees & that I must make my best exertions to effect the objects. I am now instructed

to open negotiations with the Cherokees for the purpose aforsd. aforesaid and shall omit nothing in my power to obtain the cession of the lands mentioned also the the Cherokee lands lying on the North side of the Tennessee river. nothing but a cession of the lands first mentioned will put an end to the Chickesaw Chickasaw claim to the same lands, or most of them, that is one reason why they aught ought to sell. Another reason is they hold too much land, this only retards their improvement in civilization another reason is they are in Debt they want money to pay their debts & to make provisions for schools & other improvementsâ€” The Cherokee chiefs particularly those who were in the army all know & respect you; your opinion & advise would have more effect on them than that of any other man on the face of the earth and should it be in your
