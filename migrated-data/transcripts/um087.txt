Columbia, Tenn Tennessee , Feby. February 17th 1843 My dear Sister, You have no idea how much pleasure your kind letter afforded me, more I suppose, from being unexpected, for by your delay in writing, I had concluded that I was so unfortunate as to be forgotten by you. You can imagine with what delight I was undeceived. I hasten to answer yours, hoping that you will follow my example. From your many promises before I left home, I satisfied myself with the idea that in you, I should certainly find a regular correspondant correspondent ; but the excuse which you offer, I consider a very good one, also, in this case acceptable. As I have not written home since the Examination I shall devote a few lines of this letter in giving you a partial description of it. I have no doubt, but that you feel some anxiety to hear. Mr. Smith thinks that all the girls acquitted themselves very much to their credit. It lasted three days, commenced on Friday and continued until Tuesday evening. only two days

vacation were given us to recover from our fatigue. There was a concert every night. The Music was considered very fine by persons in general. I am delighted to hear that Papa has promised to bring you up in the summer. I know you will be pleased with the Institute, and willing to come yourself to school. I took my first lesson on the Guitar yesterday, and am very much pleased with it, I think that I shall like it more than the Piano, but am determined not to neglect the Piano, as I know that is Papa's favorite Instrument. I intend trying to improve my voice this session, for the Guitar Music is very poor, without it is accompanied with a good voice. Alice Bennis complains very often, because you dont write to her, I think she is learning very rapidly. she also appears to be very well satisfied, with the school, although she is sepparated separated from her Parents. She received a letter from her Mother last week, saying that Aunt Butler intended returning to Jackson in a few weeks, but was then on a visit to her relatives, who, I believe, reside in the neighbourhood neighborhood . I expect you all are very anxious that she should return. I had almost forgotten to give you an important piece of news. Cousin Knox has a fine daughter. He thinks her the most beautiful child in the world. It is is is now past twelve oclock, and for fear of breaking the sabbath, I must bid you an afft. affectionate Good night, Mary J. Jane Chester

My dear Brother John , Taking advantage of the blank sheet in Sister's letter, I shall write you a few lines, but can tell you, that you need not expect, any thing more than a scolding . I console myself with the idea that although I have the pleasure of receiving so very few letters from you, perhaps you think of me sometimes. I have various speculations, concerning the cause of your not writing, It may be be that your time is too much occupied with your school duties, in Hunting, or you dislike to writing is the reason, notwithstanding all these reasons, I do think, that you might have taken time to write to me at least once. Tell brother Robert I dont do not know any excuse, he could have for not writing. It would give me great pleasure to receive a letter from him. he must give me a description of every thing relating to Home — How you all come one, if King & Will have grown any, and if little Sam is as fine a fellow as ever, & if he talks much about his sister Janey, and wants to see me. Since I have been boarding with Mrs. Wormely I have had a great deal of pleasure. I suppose you recollect Kate I find ⁁ her a very agreeable companion. We walk out almost every evening, generally accompanied by two or three other girls. I have just commenced the study of Botany I think it more interesting than either of my other studies. Tell Papa that Uncle Walker has not been at home since christmas nor is he expected for a month, I believe, I have never gotten any money from him. I should like for him to get Cousin Sam

to make some arrangements in the store for me. I promise him I shall be very economical. I suppose you are tired of this scolding letter, or at least I am, so giving your fair warning that this is my last letter to you; until you write, & hoping to receive one very soon, from both you & Brother Robert. Your ever afft. affectionate Sister postmark for Feb. 20 Miss Martha B. Chester , Jackson , Tenn. Tennessee I did not perceive that my writing would be seen, until I had finished it. so you will please excuse it. My Dear Mary Jane 17 Feby February 1843
