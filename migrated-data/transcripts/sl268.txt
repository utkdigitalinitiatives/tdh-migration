Mar March the 9th 1843 Mr House I again write you a few lines asking of you if it is in your power to let me have the pills to take at home. I would not ask it of you if my situation was such that I could stay in nashville I dont think that I posibly possibly could confine myself to a room in Nashville. in my low state of health. here at home I can as I have my relations with me to cheer me up, and all the necessary attention paid me that I would wish. There the medicine might operate before day and I would be caught without fire or attention and you know from experience how an invalid suffers without attention. If you possibly can let me have the medicine I will come down and get it and will be wiling willing to obligate myself in a bond of five thousand dollars that know one shall ever see the pills. I have waited and studied upon it since you wrote me that you were moraly morally bound knot not to give them out. whether I would come down and put myself under you or knot but have come to the determination not to do so as I think I would be runing running a great risk to take them in nashville. I would knot Mr House ask them of you if it was not for my low situation and you have had the feelings of one in my situation and I hope it will induce you to let me have them you may think it a little strange in me to ask it of you since you wrote to me what you did. I have such strong confidence in it

curing me that I am anxious to give it another trial at home which I know if I then fail it will not be my fault as I should use all possible means to take care of myself. write to me and let me know if you can let me have them and if you can I will come down immediately. and if the medicine should cure me I will give you one hundred dollars or as much money as you should ask.
