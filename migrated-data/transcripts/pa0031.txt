Highwassee Garrison 6th August 1813 Sir I have received your letter covering a Talk from the Big Warrior to Colonel Hawkins & have endeavored to make a proper rise of it here._ I have also received your letter of the 16th July ult. ultimo accompanied by two letters addressed to you by the honorable Mr Fort relating to certain salt peter caves & shall attend to your observations on the subject._ On the 22nd of May last I addressed a letter to you on the subject of the payment of the Cherokee annuity for the current year. I have lately received a letter from the receiver of public monies in Madison County M. Territory informing that he can probably furnish the amount required for the object by the last of September next. I therefore propose to pay the annuity to the Cherokees sometime in October next provided it shall meet your approbation. It has never been considered proper to pay out the money except in the presence of the U States Troops_ at present there are no Troops of any description here the few that were here were withdrawn about ten days ago to join their Corps, Riflemen

ordered it is said to the N North . Western Army__ It is very doubtful whether Troops peace can be preserved on this extreme frontier without the aid of Troops. The civil war amongst the Creeks has placed the Cherokees in a disagreable disagreeable situation, should the insurgent get the ascending they will if possible corrupt the Cherokees for the hostilities of the insurgent party is in fact against the United States _ A number of the well disposed Creeks have fled to the Cherokee Villages for safety. I have advised the Cherokee Chiefs not to let any of the insurgent party come into their country because it will subject them to the suspicion of the white people on the frontier__ The friendly Creeks applyed applied to the Cherokees for aid & a number armed but I believe none of them did march. The headmen of the Cherokees advised first to wait the effect of pacific measures & have appointed a meeting of their National Council for that purpose_ Since the removal of the troops the Cherokee feel themselves unsafe_ their northern boundary line is more than 250 miles in length_ A number of Intruders are on their land, others are preparing to go on, nothing but military force can restrain these aggressions_ one strong company of troops, one part stationed here & another part in Tellico would

perhaps be sufficient to keep peace on this long line by frequent patroling patrolling . The conduct of the Cherokees has been decidedly friendly__at the commencement of the war. Several young chiefs offered to raise men & offer their service to the government_ I asked a young chief whether he thot thought , in case the Cherokees should be employed they could be restrained from commiting committing acts of Barbarity, he replyed replied that they could be restrained_ I would not suffer them to act except against the Britchish British & their Allies__ If the British continue their savage warfare what can be done to prevent it? Shall we suffer it? it is difficult for humanity to answer_ It may be asked what interest have the Cherokees in this war I answer they owe the U. States more than they are able to repay_ The United States have saved their nation from perdition_ they have raised them up from a state of hunters to Hurdsmen Herdsmen , Cultivators & manufactures_ While under the English they learned nothing useful, they acquired nothing from the English but vices which placed their own in the light of comparative virtues, they then left them confirmed in their savage customs & manners & without a single

stipulation for their preservation_ The United States then took them by the hand & made them happy compared with their former condition_ There is no doubt the insurgent Creeks are acting on concert with the English thro through the northern Indians. every disaster on our side is magnified & touted to the Southern Tribes who for want of proper information are liable to be deceived & acted on by the events of the moment.__ With the greatest deference & respect & with pure motives I beg leave to suggest whether it would not be good policy to make some provisional arrangement for the employment of a good number of the Cherokees_ six or eight companies of 100 men in each having 4 officers to each company The whole making two Battalions having one Major to each Battalion_ all the officers including that of Majors should be Cherokees_ The other field officers should be white men calculated for such Troops. Such character might be found__ These Corps might be employed seperately separately or combined but more especially as light Troops, it would preclude the necessity of detailing & some times almost breaking up the regular Corp for desultory

service._ In some of my former communications to the war department I stated my opinion that it would be difficult to keep these people as idle spectators of the war it being well known that they have a passion for war, & that if the war should be continued they will if possible have a hand in it some where_. By taking a respectable number of their best people into service the fidelity of the whole nation will be secured & they will render a service they justly owe the United States I am sir very respectfully yr obt your obedient servant Return J. Meigs P.S. It may perhaps be thot thought , extraordinary, but I am confident the Cherokees can be well officered by Cherokees in the grades I have mentioned.
