I was shaking very hard with a Chill when I got it â€” I went up to the Institute on Monday & had a Chill that day about 12 oclock o'clock ; Cousin Elen came over in the evening for me to go home with her but Mr Smith said that I had better not go untill untill until next morning. I had another Chill on Wednesday but have had none scince since . They gave me a great deal of Quinine & Toddy. I took Pills that night and Oil the next morning & Doct Doctor Hays Bled me. I think now that I am entirely well. I will start to School tomorrow if the weather Premits Permits Cousin Sam says that I must stay at his house for the first two or three nights. I am verry very sorry indeed to hear that Aunt Narcissa has been sick but I hope that she is well now. tell her that she must not get out of the notion of coming up Christmas. we will have only one week's vacation. Cousin Jane & Mary Eliza started to Nashville to day today on a trip of pleasure. I expect I shall be put in the second senior class but do not know exactly yet where I shall. I think Mr Smith is a very fine man. he is verry very polite Bows a great deal but he is at the same time very positive. I like Mrs Smith verry very much indeed. She came up in the Sick

room two or three times to see me. I think one side of her face is very much like Aunt Frances . We have to write either a letter or a composition every week. Mr Smith makes the Girls let him read their letters: but they may put as long a Post Script as you like afterwards. Tell Bet I would have written to her sooner but I have been sick. I intend writing to her this week or next week if I have time. Mama tell Brother John that he must write to me. & Sister too. Oh Mother you have no idea how much I want to see home & every person there. It seems to me if I could see you all I would give every thing that I have got in this world. Oh you have no idea how verry very strict they are at the Institute the will not allow the girls to speak one word in school. They have a very large bell that they ring every half hour and evry every one of the girls does not run down stairs & back they are censured they have luncheon at 12 oclock o'clock & dinner at three. I dont do not know all of the rules but the girls says that they are very strict. There are 112 scholars at the Institute. I became acquainte acquaint with a great many of them.
