[Gift of Dr. A. L. Crabb ] New Orleans June 16th 1846 My Dear Mother This is the 7th day since our arrival here, and believe me it is the first oppirtunity opportunity that I have had of writing since that time — My constant engagements in the discharge of my duties, now that I belong to "Uncle Sam", which have so far been very laborious, has only give me time to not at night — And now, My Dear Mother, that I have seated myself for the purpose of writing you, I do not know where to commence, for I have so much to speak of, and so little time to do it in, that it leaves me in doubt as to what I shall communicate first. Well, I am growing very sick of the "Crescent City" — the weather is very warm, and our quarters not by any means comfortable — We are in the French part of the city, opposite to the lower end of the shipping on the levee, and are quartered in ⁁ an old "lumber yard", about three miles from the St. Charles Exchange — We are greatly annoyed at night, with these nasty things called musquitoes mosquitoes , and without bars to protect ourselves from them constant and attacks upon us, and were it not for these troublesome "customers" and their friends the fleas, we would get along pretty well — All are anxious to leave and Col Colonel Campbell has just informed me that we will get off this evning evening , if not then, most certainly tomorrow evning evening — There has been but little sickness amongst the troops — one death however, (the cause of imprudence in drinking cold ice water) in Capt Captain Fresser company he had but a few hours after he was taken and un

buried burried on Sunday evning evening with military honors — his name was McAdams from near Shelbyville and has a wife and three children — You will have seen before this the many compliments paid the Tennessee Volunteers by the all the public parades in the city, and it is conceeded conceded on all hands that they are the finest troops that have yet passed here on the way to Texas — Harry heard all these things I began to grow proud and look big and determined at once to parade my company, the "flowers of the army" through some of the principal streets of the city — and from the time that we were upon parade until we returned to the encampment, we were followed by crowds of citizens — and there it was that I was a foot taller than even before — The "Harsmm Gamass" " Capt Captain Foster company of Tenn. Tennesse Volunteers were noticed in the papers of the next day, and most higly highly complimented, as the finest and best drilled company of Volunteers that ever paraded through the streets of N.O. New Orleans There was scarsly scarcely a man of standing and respectability? that did not advance and give me his hand, at the same time crowding me with compliments,— but I did not get and act the part buy so much flater flattery and know that I met it with all becoming n? — I never enjoyed better health, and have not been the least sick since I left — The great hurry with which I am compelled to write, make it almost illegible — but my dear Mother know that situated as I am, that I have but little
