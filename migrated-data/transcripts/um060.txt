Shepherdsville Nov November 11th 1850 E. Edward E. Porter My Dear Friend Tell Ben I would be very much obliged to him if he would answer the letter I wrote him some time ago, Write soon yourself. My respects to all Your sincere friend C. Clay Balfrey If I am alive and kicking I will go to to to the Cane with you next Season. I saw Steven , the guide in Louisville last Saturday, his words will be out about Christmas. Tell MackKnight McKnight I will write to him when I return from weddening . { All are well and send respects. I am happy to announce the reception of yours of the 5th inst. instant also that of McKnight both of which came to hand an hour since. under other than present circumstances, perhaps I would not have answered your letter before several days but as now situated if I do not embrace the present opportunity another suitable one may not occur for some two weeks, for the following reasons: a mania for marrying seems at this time to pervade this county to an alarming extent, and to threaten a total annihalation annihilation of all the joys naturally attending Single-blessedness, but I must add, by way of parenthesis, that I have not felt any symptoms of it yet, and with the help of the Lord I hope to escape the dire fate to which I see many are daily hurrying. Well, we are going to have three weddings in our vicinity this week and next, all of which will be accompanied by the necessary routine of parties, and attended by the beaux and Belles of several adjoining counties besides what Old Bullitt can produce, which is no little

In the first place a brother of our Old friend Col Colonel Ball from Arkansas will be married tomorrow to a Miss Rogers . Ham. Field and I attendents attendants . We leave town this evening (now, in about an hour) and go out to the Cols Colonel's where we spend the night. Tomorrow morning we go to the house of the Bride and get married, and return to Col Colonel Balls tomorrow night and have big doins doings . Next day we go to another house and have big doins doings also, and on Thursday we go to another wedding which will be succeeded by Large parties on Friday and Saturday. On the Tuesday following Alfred Field will marry and the rest of the week will be spent in all sorts of frol⁁ i cking. In truth I anticipate such a time as I never had before. Well as aforesaid, these considerations induce me to write to you immediatily immediately . I hoped to receive a letter from you long before this time, but knowing of old your negligence in such matters. I canot cannot that I expected one much sooner. Judging from the tenor of your remarks I do not suppose that you and the inhabitants of Hanover are on terms of close intimacy, especially the female portion. I hope you have had no bad luck with the women. I would think from the women in which you rail against the feminine that you had be jilted Lately, if so I sympathyse sympathize . You seem anxious to get away from Hanover, but if you only knew it you are now spending your holeyon days in sighing and wishing for the trouble and sorrows and

disappointments which are inseparably connected with a more advanced stage of life. I regret to hear that there old broils between Northerners and Southerners have been revived, and fear that they may turn out greatly to the injury of Soc. Society but I hope the Court will always have an opportunity to put in "just one word of explanation" and if so I think all things can always be amicablly amicably adjusted. — On litle little circumstance and I hasten to the later part of your letter. Your Old Landlord Nick Simmons received a bullet in his back a short time since which came very near sending him to Davy Jones . He was abusing a Mr Carpenter in town, when the latter drew a revolver — placed it against his breast — and burst a cap, Nick wheeled to runn run when Mr C. Carpenter shot him in the back just below the shoulder blade, he has since recovered. Carpent Carpenter was tried and acquitted, owing to the great prejudice against your Land Lord and the eloquence of Mr. Thompson . You "perceive" (though not through any good intention of mine you think) "that I am growing in spirit on acct. account of the inconstancy of a certain daughter of the South." very true, and you think I ought to have told you of it sooner. well perhaps I ought, and it was my intention to do so at first, but upon maturer consideration I saw no necessity for it, and as I always felt the greatest delicacy in saying anything to you upon that subject I concluded to spare myself the pain of making the communication, knowing that you would soon find it out by other means, I am obliged to you for your

sympathy, but find your "philosophic conclusion" to be but poor consolation, and think an individual must be of a cold passionless nature who can fully adopt the sentiment enfavdid in your prevent . As for the ridicule with which you seem desposed disposed to treat the affair, I can only say that it may be fun for you but it is death to me. You might make the bet which you propose, via: "that I will not fall in love soon with a child of 16." with the greatest certainty of winning, for I think it is reduced to a mathamatical mathematical certainty that I cannot love any thing that wears peticoats petticoats for some years to come, but, Should the time come when I am possesed possessed for loveing loving , 16 years of age would never make the slightest difference with me, for it is my private opinion that if impressions made at the age of 16 do not continue, they will not at any subsequent age. Nor can I see any thing "ludicrous" in the business. I have reviewed my own conduct in this affair frequently, and have acted with circuns friction, throughout and I must ⁁ say however unbecomeing unbecoming it may be, that I have nothing to reproach myself with from the beginning, this I speak with a clear conscience, and I believe I am conscientious at time. I am extremely glad that you have referred to this matter, for I see it is likely to restore a perfect understanding between us, which to me is very desirable. From the beginning of this unfortunate affair all that I could ever see or hear of your actions or sayings induced me to believe that you did oppose it, and would oppose it to the last. This I thought was severe. If you with whom I had lived more than a year on terms of intimacy and friendship should condemn and oppose the consummation of my wishes what was I to expect from them who were even more interested and less acquainted with me. Cherishing these sentiments I felt a coldness toward you and could not nor would not have acted otherwise than in accordance with my feelings. But your assurance that you have never done anything to injure me settles this matter to my joyful satisfaction. And now I hope that all feelings of friendship that may have at any previous time existed may be renewed, strengthened, doubled or whatever else you chose. I chalod
