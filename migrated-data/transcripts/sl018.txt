Head Quarters Division of the South Nashville 4th July 1816 Sir Your letter of the 1st Instant is duly received and so soon as the Instructions reffered referred to reach me, Shall be fully answered— Captain Alton is progressing in removeing removing , and burning the Houses, and Fences of the intruders, on the North side of the Tennessee River . There has been an application for indulgence by several inhabitants who state, that they are not intruders but that they settled on the lands of the Chickasaws, and built a mill, at the special request of the Indians themselves as well as the Agent of that tribe, and that they now remain for its protection. This application is accompanied with the Permits of the several Officers, who have since been in command at Fort Hampton But as I have no discretionary power on this subject, (the Agent having required the removal of all) I can only order the destruction of the property to be suspended, until I am informed by the Agent whether those families hold his permission for living on the lands in question I have written (of this date) to Colnl Colonel Cocke on this subject, And enclose for your consideration a letter from Mr Louis Winston (a gentleman of Huntsville )
