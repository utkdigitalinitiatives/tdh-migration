I therefore upon consultation with Mr Conner postponed the trip, though should it be necessary say in July I will willingly go provided a can accomplish anything by it. I however without delay wrote to President Polk on the subject, saying to him that I would he pleased for him to confer the place upon me, if he could do so with his views of propriety, that I considered it unnecessary to visit W.
