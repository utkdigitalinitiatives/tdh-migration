Washington March 22d 1829 My Dr Dear Sir I have just received from Genl General Coffee a letter inclosing one from Doctor Lindsley to him informing that Hutchings has been suspended from College, & is now at the Hermitage Idle. This intelligence is a sore grief to me, and one from his pledge to me, of good behaviour, & application to his Book, and strict adherence to the rules of the university, & the orders of the professors, I was not prepared to hear, I was not prepared you may say to him to hear of his disgrace, which I had taken so much pains, by my frequent admonitions to prevent, nor did I believe he would so far forget himself, as to inflict such a wound on my feelings, if he was regardless of his own__ But it is so, and I must adopt such measures, as will yet preserve him from ruin, & myself from disgrace. On the receipt of this my dear friend can I ask the goodness of you, forthwith to take him & enter him with Mr. Otey at Franklin, & advise Genl General Coffee thereof, & draw upon him for the amount of his Tuition & Board in favour of Mr Mister . Otey. I have this day wrote Genl Coffee that I would thus direct you, & he will be prepared to meet your draft for Hutchings board & tuition.

If he can be restrained & governed, I would wish him to study algebra & some branches of mathematics, with Belle letters, & natural & moral philosophy, and review his greek & latin which he has read. My Dr Sir write me on the receipt of this and let me know how your dear little Elisabeth is, & whether poor poll the favourite bird of my dear wife is still living. present me affectionately to Elisabeth to your father & mother, and all our relations. Say to them that we are all well & all send their love to them & believe me respectfully your friend Andrew Jackson William Donelson Esqr Esquire
