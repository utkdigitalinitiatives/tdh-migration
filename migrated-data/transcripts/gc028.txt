Alexandria 22nd Dec.r December 1834 Dear Cousin After waiting with great impatience for a long time I had the pleasure yesterday of receiving your very affectionate and interesting letter of the 24th ult. Ultimo giving me the pleasing intelligince intelligence of the good health of yourself & family and friends generally. my family are in good health our little son has had a severe attack of dysintery dysentery but is improving. I have been very unfortunate this year with my negroes have lost four likely fellows one of cholerea cholera two of fever and one of dysintery (Randal) the latter disease has been quite prevalent this fall and very fatal though has nearly disappeard. disappeared Our crops in this section of country were destroyed by a succession of storms and heavy rains, some distance above us on red river they are remarkably fine the storms did not reach so far. I calculated on making three hundred bales but have made but one hundred & sixty have shiped shipped all and sold seventy eight from 12 1/2 to 13 1/2 my crop will bring me as much this year as it did last though my former was much better; my crop of last year made by twenty one hands brought me $10.300 a part I shiped to Liverpool brought me 16 cents, a considerable lot sold a few days ago in New Orleans at 19 cents the rise was produced by speculation and immediately fell to from 12 to 16 again but is thought will be better in the spring

As regards a blacksmith I have had one purchased some time in Carolina by Mr Mister Henry for me at $900- and expect to recieve receive him soon after christmas I was informed while there that he was a first rate workman. You state you you have an idea of bringing ten or twelve negroes to the Mississippi for sale and you also state provided you could get lands on accomadating accommodating terms and the location of the country such as suits you that you would like to settle a farm, if that be your intention and you conclude to establish a place you ought not to sell negroes unless your object be to purchase them that would suit you better, if you wish to settle in the southern country I would advise you to visit red river above this place it is a fine county & settling up very fast, the Bosleys are up there & Tom Sutton from Sampson and several theirs, negroes are selling from seven to eight hundred dollars, I was at a sale the other day where negroes sold on a credit of twelve months (a estimate) likely mor more sold from twelve to thirteen & eighty dollars. It is uncertain whether I shall come up next summer or not I will write you on the subject in a month or two. Sarah & wife join me in love to you cousin Martha & family and the rest of our relations remember me to all my acquaintances and accept my bet wishes Yr Your affte affectionate relative Tho. Thomas O. Moor remember me to Mr Mister Wilson
