Crabstick 27th January 1815 Dr Dear . Brother Yesterday I received your letter of the 11th instant. The news which it contained I had heard but a little time before, tho though I had anticipated some good news for I actually heard the detail, as the day before I heard such at this place, the sound of cannon fired in rejocing rejoicing at Nashville __ The capture of our Brothers was new to me and to all of your guards men, but I can say they had much same hear they were prisoners than that they had been killed in battle, as in the former case tis hoped a speedy exchange will be affected; and the lattre latter is only preferable to perpetual slavery May I be damned if I had not rather die then become a subject to the King of Great Britain, and I will do it before such a circumstance can take place again business I have incurred little as been & ability would find__ you money I have not been able to collect of Crofton as Wilkerson not yet returned__ Crofton Newman borrowed 30 Dollars opad me for you Your pork I have salted up often paying Powers 10__ Peter 2 & I myself end up making $19 in pork the balance I collect for you about 14 hundred weight
