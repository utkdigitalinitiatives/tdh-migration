Camargo 13th Octr. October 1846 My Dear Mother I have just this evening met with my old neighbor Mr. Campbell who was in the battle at Monterey, and is now on his return to Rutherford He has promised he will go to see you when he gets to Rutherford and tell you all about me and the position of the army & I leave him to tell this, without time to write any news, but take the opportunity of writing you a short hasty letter, to give my love, my devoted love to you— Mr. Campbell starts back on the first boat that leaves this evening or in the morning— And I am making preparations to visit Monterey & to start in the morning— Remember me affectionately to Pa & all the family— I recd received a few days ago the cravat & socks you sent, which I prize very much, not only because they come from you, but on account of their intrinsic value to me here— Bob Foster is well Your affectionate son Wm R. William Richard Caswell
