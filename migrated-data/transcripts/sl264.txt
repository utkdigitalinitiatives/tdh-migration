Nashville July 16th 1850 My own dear George Since I wrote to you last; (which was a week ago, to Cahawba ) I have received two very affectionate, (and need I say) welcome, and much prized letters from you; It thrills my heart with sincere pleasure to hear, as it were from your own lips — that you love me so fondly still, and I will do as you tell me " meaning your love for me, by my own". It gives me great pleasure to say that the Cholera is fast subsiding; There are now but few cases from day to day; not more than from three to six, or eight deaths in twenty four hours I went down town this morning for the first time in two weeks, and I assure you things look much more cheerful than they did then, notwithstanding I met with a good many pale, anxious faces; Mr Moses , your next door neighbor, has lost a son, and a daughter from cholera; and I believe the whole family have had it more or less — I suppose Mr McClelland has given you an account of his wifes attack which was a very severe one; his family are all well now

Our friends the "Browns" are with us yet Mr Brown has been more alarmed about cholera than any one I have ever seen; he has stayed at home constantly during the time it raged so badly, and some of the time he did not come down stairs to hi his meals; and he scarcely eat any thing at all — cousin L, had last week, a severe hemorrhage, and Dr Ford says it was from her lungs — she does not complain much, of feeling unwell, but looks very badly and is extreamly extremely anxious to take a trip some whare where — but it is hard to move Mr Brown to do any thing, or go any whare — they have been talking for four weeks past, of going to Kingston and have not gone yet — and cousin L says there is no knowing wheather they will go at all, I proposed yesterday (if she did not get off somewhare before) to go with you and Sallie and myself to the Cave, when you return; she says that trip would suit her exactly — Mr McIntosh says he is bound to go some whare, that he may eat corn and cucumbers, and not be affraid afraid of getting sick, he says it wont do to eat them here — In the last two weeks Aunt Silvey and Jim have both died, but neither of cholera; Jim tried to cut

his throat, or rather did cut it, two or three weeks before he died, but that did not kill him. Louisa was pretty badly attacked last week with rheumatism, she has taken your pills and is somewhat relieved, though not entirely, I am, going out tomorrow to stay all day, and nurse her — My dear Husband if I am not mistaken; I asked you in my letter to Columbus , in mercy, to tell me if you had the least shadow of an idea, at what time you would be at home, and you did not grattify gratify me so much as to pretend to give a guess about the time — you over looked that part of the letter I am sure — But I wish you to remember, that altho although I am exceedingly anxious for your return; yes more anxious than words can express; I do not by any means wish you to leave any thing undone that you intended to do when you left I want you to finish it all this time; even if it should keep you two, or three, weeks longer from home than you expected I would rather you would attend to it now, than to leave me again — I never wish you to go away from me any more, We hav have not long to live in this world at most; and while I do live I want to be with you; no one on this earth can fill your place with me.
