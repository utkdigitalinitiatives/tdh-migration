Near Gallatin June 27th 1842 Dear Sir, I am entirely satisfied from what I have seen and know that the present Legislature never can agree upon the questions of districting the State and of electing US senators under such a state of things I think it is the duty of every Representative and Senator to resign so that the people may have an opportunity of settling those questions, and For it is all important to their welfare that the State should be represented in Congress. It seems to me that every member of the present Legislature who had rather serve his country than hold office is under such a state of things bound to resign I should doubt the Patriotism of any man who would cling and hold on to office when he knows by pursueing pursuing that course the very best interest of those who gave him his office must suffer you will please therefore accept of this as my resignation of the seat I hold in the present General Assembly of the State of Tennessee To his Excellency James C. Jones Governor of the State of Tennessee Yours Respectfully Thomas Barry

Private The propriety of passing a law to compel the Banks to receive their own notes for their debts has been suggested to me by a Louisianian who says that in that state the Banks refused to receive their own notes which caused them to be almost worthless They then bought up their own notes for little or nothing greatly to the injury of their note holders to prevent the same thing here I respectfully suggest the importance of calling the attention of the leg legislature . to the subject. Yours T.B.
