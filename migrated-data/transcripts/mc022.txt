No 18 Camargo, Mexico 10th October 1846 My Dear Wife. Majr. Major Brookins Campbell , from Washington County , arrived here yesturday yesterday evening, direct from Tennessee , by way of Nashville - My first question to him, was to ascertain how your health was and athough although he could give me no direct answer to my interrogatories upon this subject, yet I derived much comfort from my cross examination of him, and Mr. Royston who came with him - They said they did not hear particularly how you was but merely that all were well - this of course was no satisfaction but they said they saw Eliza , in a carriage with Mary , returning from a visit to Ann in Knoxville , & from this I infered inferred your health must have materially improved, or Eliza would not have left you. - And I could only guess, whether you was at home or not - They saw my Mother at Nashville, she was on a visit to Mrs. Foster , who was very sick - My mother sent me a very fine black silk cravat, and ⁁ 2 pairs of Lambs - wool socks - James Nichol wrote to me, that Ma had heard from you, and that you was very well. I expect it was about such information as I received thro' through Majr. C. Major Campbell I have only received one letter from you (and that was by Lieut. Lieutenant Turnley ) Since I left home. I suppose my letters have been sent to San Antonio . - If I had recd. received them I should have had many of my anxious conjectures explained, relative to your heath health & comfort, relative to Eliza, to our little boy - to your Ma, & Mary, Alfred , Henry , Ann & our family, our servants, our neighbours neighbors - & c et cetera - What has become of Thos. Thomas M. Anderson - If he is at home - tell him to write me all the little neighbourhood neighborhood news - and direct his letter to " Captain Wm. R William Richard . Caswell " " Care of Brig. Gen. Brigadier General Pillow ." " Hd Irs. 2nd Brigade. U.S.A United States of America ". " Mexico "- And so you can direct your letters; But I cannot tell where our Head Quarters may be when a letter will reach me from home, after you receive this.. I have calculated that the war would now be ended without any more fighting, but our negotiations must proceed slowly, and that therefore I shall be delayed some time yet in my return home -

The Officers of the Army however, generally believe that the war is to be protracted - and carried on with rigor and energy - A despatch dispatch messenger from Washington City passed here last Thursday, on his way to Monterey , with secret orders to Genl. General Taylor , - I suppose I know their substance thro' through a letter from the President to Gen. General Pillow - We are looking for a reply from Genl. General Taylor in a few days - with Orders to Gen General . Patterson with Genl. General Pillow & his command and a considerable force, to make a pressing attack upon the enemy in another direction - And my calculation is that in about two weeks more I shall join my company at Matamoras - and proceed along the Western Coast of the Gulf - But no calculations are to be relied on, by a person who has to obey any and all orders he may receive - You know an armistice was agreed upon by Genl. General Taylor & Ampudid , that there should be a cessation of hostilities for two months - this ends on ⁁ or about the 20th Novr November - and at the end of the Armistice, we will be ready to enter with renewed energy upon the war - Under this view of my future course, I shall not be farther north, of this, or west in this latitude, on military duty - and having nothing now to do but to await orders - I expect to take a trip of pleasure to Monterey , and to go up with a company which leaves here on day after to-morrow tomorrow , - David Cummings is the only East Tennesseean Tennessean who will probably go with me - and when I get to Monterey or soon after my return (for I shall remain there but a few days) I will write to you - and if I can collect materials, with leisure to write - I will write a letter to some of our papers - which you will see ( if published) and will not be repeated in my letter to you - I have just within the last hour concluded to go to Monterey - I may meet with some obstacle ⁁ in contrary orders- Balie Peyton and Genl. General Marshall have been expected to fight a duel here to-day today - as they quarrelled yesturday yesterday &, struck each other with their fist

It has however been compromised & settled this evening - Mr. Royston tells me that Sam. Carter . has resigned and returned home - I am surprised at this - if you see Sam. tell him to write to me - I have interrogated Mr. R. Mr. Royston very closely - but I regret he could not give me any more particular news about you - Octr October . 12th . I have received to-day today a letter from Henry, which I do assure was very gratifying to me, and tell him whenever I can render him as great favor I will do so; but my letters to you must be an an answers to him, and to Eliza -This morning I was on duty in furnishing details of workmen in the Quarter Masters department, as blacksmiths - And in making up a company to visit Monterey, to start on day after to-morrow tomorrow morning, for you must recollect that, a small party is considered to be in danger of being cut off by Robbers, whom we generally suppose to belong to Canales band - In the afternoon, I met with a duelling party, two Texas Captains with their seconds I went out with them upon the ground - we all concluded to try and make up the difficulty - at one time we gave up the hope of a compromise, & squared ourselves to see them fire at 40 yds yards distant with rifles but it was finally compromised - And to gratify my curiosity, in this - I exposed myself to a thorough drenching of raine rain - I have no news of any change in the position or movements of the Army - The only movements now going on are heavy baggage trains, loaded with provisions, from here to Monterey, and guarded generally by some 200 Soldiers - And within the last day or two - many Texas Rangers who have been discharged, returning home ⁁ many with trophies - such as Mexican Lances, swords, guns, Saddles - horses &c et cetera - Altho Although I have not recd. received letters - I know they have been written - you must keep up writing, for I think I shall begin to receive them soon- In the mean time. I shall write every day or two & despatch dispatch you a letter at least every week or two - I take more pleasure in
