Moorfield Moorefield , Hardy, Cty. Va. County Virginia April 27th 1835 — Meus Charissimus Amicus : Your's of Feby. February 2nd past marked the 13th came to hand in the early part of the present month; an answer to which has been purposely deferred until this moment. You are aware that the month of April is to our profession in Va Virginia a month of business — The Cir. Sup. Circuit Superior Courts throng us — Our Elections take place — & all the et ceteras of such like occasions. In addition to all this — our muddy — haggard village, has in the providence of God been honoured honored with the Session of the Winchester Presbytery — which took its leave of us this morning. For these reasons & with the expectation of deriving some interesting intelligence from these scenes — I intentionally forewent (will that were pass) my usual promptitude, in replying to your anxiously looked for & welcomely recd received epistle. It is my purpose now to redeem my pledge & to gratify, in part at least, your wishes — You emphatically urge me to write — but what shall I write ? Nothingness & vanity seem inscribed upon every thing around me — & an incubus of dejection is loading me with its leaden weights. The heavens are shrouded in darkness — & my mind sympathetically partakes of the gloom — With such feelings & under such circumstances — you will realize but little pleasure in the presence of a barren & lifeless epistle. But such as I have I give out thee. You express the wish — that when I started my friend Joe Fellows for the South — I had stuck to him & thus been dragged out of this slough of despond — Our wishes are mutual. But dire necessity or the illusions of hope — have fixed me to the spot — & altho although it is any thing other than an oasis — I can not tear myself from it — as yet . True I am not of the seed-royal — Either by descent or adoption nor will I ever be by matrimonial amalgamation. But having a little of the old roman spirit in me — I cannot but assert my rights — nor shall it e'er be said of me — "He was banished the land of his birth or adoption" — In plain English — you know Efforts have ever been making by some of the line to expel me from their borders — & to fix the brand of a stranger upon my forehead & exclude me from their little comth of privileges — & the means have been as various as their desires. But in all have they been frustrated — My practice has been flourishing.

My prospects are daily increasing & the tables are completely turned The spoke of my wheel of fortune is now in the ascendant — & I have no doubt ere long — the flag of truce will be hoisted & myself invited to a parley — An ambassador or two have already honoured honored me with their presence — But I am not to be wooed or won — Just as soon as I learn that, mine enemies are convinced of the futility of their efforts & designs to expatriate me — I will pack up my little household & visit your or some other land — You may think strangely of this course of conduct, but its just me — I ask no favours favors — I brook no insults — I stand upon my own hook. Our elections are going on & Virginia is becoming herself again — The newfangled Whiggism is crumbling under the burthen of its own discordant materials — Hardy has again reelected Mullin — but under a hard pace — Mr Leigh will doubtless be instructed out of his illgotten seat in the U. S. United States Senate — The panic phantom has evanished vanished — & the deluded people are awaking to their senses — & retrieving their injured rights — A. J. Cunningham who was a candidate, declined, having ascertained his nullifying doctrines would not take. The Presbytery has been in Session a few days — There is no extraordinary excitement on the subject of religion — Some good has been done — but the number of those who come up to the help of of of the Lord against the mighty is small. Moorfield Moorefield is something like Gilboa — Her youth are fonder of the midnight more than the cross — Your friend & acquaintance Miss Caroline Seymour was married a few weeks ago to Job Hatton of Peter — Thus they go — All in the Friendschoff — as the Dutch say — A. E. W. and L. D. are the only relics of the Creek — As I seldom get up in that region — I know but little about them — And your hint — is malapropos — I have no penchant for either the oldest or the youngest of either Uncle Job or David — darters daughters !!! A. J. C. A. J. Cunningham is still in status quo — & commodities of this kind are by no means

in demand here — A Mr Williams from Shenandoah has taken on of the Miss Craigins to himself — He had his eye on a fortune but like the chaps who put his finger upon the flea — when he came to look for it, it was 'nt wasn't there. Thus fortune hunters receive hard fare in these parts — A little avaritious avaricious wretch took it in his head a few weeks ago to marry the widow Heath — soon after the honey moon he became jealous — & well he might — for she all ways always would play second fiddle — & threatened to shoot her — for this threat she put him in durance vile; and her creditors are now converting his anticipations of a fortune into all the dire realities of misfortune. Another instance & I have done — Your kind offices in behalf of D. H. Coyner have gained you a name not soon to be forgotten — He is an outcast — & gives hopes of little promise — Chill penury is staring him in the face — His name is seldom mentioned & if so — only with contempt — Beware in future — for whom you act as proxy. Mrs Foote is dead — And this morning all the Physicians were sent for by Geo. George Cunningham who is dangerously ill — I have not heard from him since — The hooping whooping cough & scarlet fever have been fatal here during the winter. Mr Scott is teaching & is well nize? — Phil. Williams is married again to a Miss Dunbar of whither whether he has gone to reside. A. J. C. talks of removing westward — but I shall believe it when I see him start or hear he has gone — James Heiskell has resumed his mercantile operations at the Burg — His wife will not leave Va. Virginia Thus I have given you a rapid & desultory sketch of what I thought would be most interesting to you — Now a word for myself. I am still a single man: but on the high road to Hymen's Court — It may be I shall have the pleasure in my next to sing a different song — But nous venous . According to your request I sent in for mathematical instruments — & am rapidly increasing my library — I think I shall during the summer or early in the fall pack up & put — Look out for me — If I dont — & you come in next winter — you can have my good company on your return — should you desire it — My funds are low — & some how or other I can't hoard up — But if I ever make a break — there is no telling where or when I stop — I say write — do

My father is anxious to remove to the west & is making rapid progress in his preparatory measures — So soon as he has settled down again I shall be contented & free as air — If I succeed in winning a little Eliza of Woodstock — who is now wearing her studying cap — I am off for Illinois — If defeated — why then I must look out for a supper somewhere else — Write to me — & what thou doest, do quickly — Yours Affectionately A.
