Kingston April 6th 1838 Dear Charles I Returned home on the 4th Inst Instant from the East after a pretty long and tedious trip I left home for Balt Baltimore on the 17th Feby February and Started with the intention of going the Virginia Rout Route but on arriving at Knoxville I fell in company with Mr Wm William B French of that place who was going to Pittsburg Pittsburgh to bring a Steam Boat up this river which he had previously purchased, and I also found the roads so tromped up and frozened that they were almost impassible. I there changed my deriction direction for Lexington Ky. Kentucky and went across the mountains in the Coldest Snowy weather I ever traveled in my life. at Lexington we took the Stage for Mayeville on the Ohio expecting to go up it in a Steam boat but to our very great misfortune we found the ice running at such a rate that all the boats had stopped running. and we were Compelled to continue in Stages all the way through Ohio, and pay the most exorbitant Charges for travelling and go ahead day and night while everything was frozen above and below, but as good fortune would have it we arrived at Wheeling Va. Virginia safe at which place we parted the weather remained very cold until after I got to Balto Baltimore at Baltmo Baltimore I met Porrell , Barclay & Buck Winslett who were on their way to N New York after staying a few days at Baltimore we went to Phila Philadelphia they Stayed a few days

On arriving home I learned that Jane had been very unwell for some time, she was taken while in Kingston at School with the Influenza and for some days was though thought to be quite dangerous but recovered in about 2 weeks So that She could come out home. She is quite harty hearty at present. one of Seggets little daughters and several others have died with it this spring. Martin Watson is very Sick of it at this time_ the balance of the family have enjoyed good health. Fredk Frederick did not get back untill until after I left he did nothing with the land except appoint an agent to attend to it. this is vacation month and the boys are all at home except monroe. A letter was received from Lewis a short time since in which he states that his health has been good & that he will be certain to be at home before Christmas he did not say whether he would remain or not_ I am having my goods brought around by warter water . & I am a little afraid the they will be delayed on the Ten. Tennessee River though they have keels in which will bring up goods when the warters are too low for Steam Boats_ I Saw Duarmond as I came home he gave me fur hives from you relative to business. you were correct in the first instance as to the amount. he has not heard from Wright _ Franklin was down to see Catharine a
