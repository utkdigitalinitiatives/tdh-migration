Columbia March 17. 29. Dear Sir: Your kind favour favor of the 26th ultimo came to hand on the 4th instant. Since its reception, I have been assiduous in my endeavors to procure for you such mules as you described. I have found its a matter of no small difficulty to get such as would answer your purpose. Your information of a considerable number being raised in this county, I believe, is correct; but the number, at this time, in market, is small & great many have, in the course of the past fall autumn ⁁ and winter been driven off, to supply the demand in the south. On saturday last, I made a condition⁁ al purchase

of the only two yet found to suit your description. I think it would be well for Mr. Woods , if he can be spared from your farm, to come out, and see if they will answer. One of them is a horse two years old in May; the other a mare two years old in August. They have last winter been worked some little in a cotton gin, and appear to disadvantage, as they are rather lean. You can get them ⁁ both for sixty five dollars in cash. You are aware, I can't know much about the value of mules, or I would say, I think them a good bargain. I got competent judges to examine them, who corroborated my opinion. Mr Booker , whom you know to be one of the closest and hardest dealers in the world, and who is, at this time, buying himself, says

they are worth the money. Mr. Badget , (the owner) who is but a youth and knows too little of the world to commence lying for the mere speculation, tells me they came out of pretty good mares, and that Capt. Captain Peters has offered him $80. for them on a credit till christmas. He has agreed to keep them till I could hear from you. His residence ⁁ is seven miles below town, on the north side of the river. You can send immediately to his house, or to Columbia and I will go down. It will always afford me great pleasure to render you assistance, in any business I am capable of performing. Present ⁁ me to Mrs. O. — and accept for yourself assurances of the highest respect from Your most obt servt obedient servant T. H. Cahal Hon. Honorable John Overton.
