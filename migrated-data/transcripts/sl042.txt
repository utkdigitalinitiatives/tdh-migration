(private) Washington June 7th 1829 My Dr Dear Sir, Your letter of the 19th ult ultimo is just received. What satisfaction to me to be informed that you & Mr Hume had visited the Hermitage & Tomb, of my dear departed wife, how distressing it has been to me to have been drawn by public duty from that interesting state, where my thoughts delight to dwell, so soon after this heavy bereavement, to mingle with all the bustle, labour, & care of public life, when my age, my enfeebled health and constitution forewarned me, that my time cannot be long here upon earth, and admonished me that it was time I should place my earthly house in order and prepare for another, & I hope a better world— my dr dear wife had your future state much at heart, she often spoke to me on this interesting subject in the dead hours of the night, and has shed many tears on the subject ⁁ occasion — your reputation upon the sincere interest your dr dear sister took in your future happiness are such, that as sound reason dictates— yes my friend it is time that you should withdraw from the turmoils of this world, & prepare for another & better— you have well provided

for your household, you have directed your children, and furnished them with an outfit into life sufficient, with good management and economy to build an independence upon—you have sufficient around you to make you and your old lady independent & comfortable during life, & when gone hence, perhaps as much as will be prudently managed, and if it should be imprudently managed, then, it will be a curse, rather than a blessing to your children— I therefore join in the sentiments of my deceased & beloved wife, in admonishing you to withdraw from the busy of this world, & put your house in order for the rest, by laying hold "of the one thing needful"——go read the Scriptures, the joyful promises it contains, will be a balsome to all your troubles, and create for you a kind of heaven here on earth, a consolation to your troubled mind that is not to found found, the in the hurry & bustle of this world. Could I but withdraw from the scenes that surround me, to the private scenes ⁁ walks of the Hermitage, how soon would I be found in the solitary walks ⁁ shades of my garden, at the tomb of my dr dear wife, there to spend my days in the silent sorrow & in peace from the toils and strife of this world, with which

I have been long since suspected— but this is denied me, — I cannot retire, with prosperity— When my friends drag me before the public, contrary to my wishes, and that of my dr dear wife, I foresaw all this evil but I was obliged to bend to the wishes of my friends, as it was believed, it was necessary to perpetuate the blessings of liberty to our country, & to put down misrule— My political creed, compelled me to yield to the call, and I consoled myself with the idea of having the counsel & society of my my dr dear wife, & one term would soon sound, when we would retire to the Hermitage & spend our days in the service of our god— But o, how fluctuating are all earthly things, — at the time I least expected it, & could least spare her, she was snatched from me, and I left here a solitary monument of grief, without the least hope of any happiness here below, surrounded with all the turmoils of public life and no time for recreation, or for friendship— from this busy scene I would to god I could retire, & live in solitude. How much the conduct of A.J. Andrew Jackson Hutchings , corodes corrodes my feelings
