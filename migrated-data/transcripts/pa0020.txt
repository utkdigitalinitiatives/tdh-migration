We ought all to be sensible of this, that these old Chiefs were the means of our having peace with all the red people as will as the whites, & now turn them of it is wrong & we are the younger people to stand before them it does not look right & we must know that the old Chiefs ought to be by consulting their young Chiefs We the Cherokees ought all to use our old head men good for they were the men at first peace us all_ There is a story raised about them that they have sold land_ this thing cannot be done without the consent of our nation, and when land is sold we all know of it & also when land is sold by any of the red people round us we all know & hear it_ and we may expect it will be the case that land will be sold by our neighbours
