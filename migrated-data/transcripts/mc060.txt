Mouth of Sweet Water Decr. December 24th 1839 Dear Charles As Ellick is going over home to commence his Christmas I write a line to inform you all of our health, fortune, prospects &c et cetera ._ We are all entirely well except Catherine, and she quite as well as could be expected taking into consideration the fact that yesterday between 12 and 1 Oclock, she became the mother of what the old ladies say is a "fine boy." And a fine fellow I think he is. Catherine would be glad for you to bring your Caroline over tomorrow if convenient, as my mother, who came over yesterday, says she will have to go home tomorrow._ If we have good luck we can give you pidgeon pigeon pie as they appear plenty yesterday evening & this morning_ allow yourself a few days to stay when you come. Old Buck is now at your service. I would be glad to hear if the furniture is made that Henry was to see to for us. We have heard that the Ga. Georgia Legislature have determined by a majority of one vote to extend the R. Rail Road to Chattanooga _ hurra for Chattanooga. Ellick has conducted himself very well for some time past & I give him a pass, till next Monday. Yours truly A. Albert S. Lenoir P.S. Caty sends howdy to the family_ she is in fine spirits & I think quite proud of her boy, as well as myself I am. A.S.L. Albert S. Lenoir
