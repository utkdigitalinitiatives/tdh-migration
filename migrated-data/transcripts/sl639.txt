Executive Dept Department Nashville July 6th 1838 To Wm McClain Esqr Esquire President and the members of the convention at Sparta also the citizens of the state by them represented or interested gentlemen Your memorial of the 15th ult ultimo has Just been recievd received accompanyd accompanyed by the central gazette containing a copy of the proceeding of you your convention at Sparta of the same date. with an address to the people of our state, on the subject of the Location of the Branches of the Bank of Tennessee , On which I entertain no doubt, you have just cause of complaint provided it is admitted that this Bank is to confer Benefits equally and generally to the citizens of our state, _ Whatever may be the inconsistent and conflicting provisions of its charter, or the variety of motives, which actuated those who were instrumental in bringing it into existence, and however difficult too carry the same into effect it would now be useless to paint [unclear] out or enquire into them, as it is now the Law of our land, the setled settled policy of our state

and becomes the duty of all concernd concerned in its administration, to make the best they can of it_ That the accommodation of all parts of the State, in the location of the branches of this Bank was deemed impracticable by a majority of the Legislature, Seems most obvious, from their having refusd refused to locate the Branches themselves as was urgd urged . and believd believed by some to be their duty. Whether the Laudable objects held forth by the advocates of this amalgamated Scheme of state policy, are to be realized, generally by our citizens, or not, time alone with its practical operations and Lasting effects, must determine but In as much as the injustice of which you complain, and Justly too, I doubt not, (relates only to borrowing your portion of to many of this Bank, at an inconvenient point to the citizens of that district of country and not having equal facilities in that respect, with other portions of the state) is a right or priviledge privilege , not deemd deemed of the highest or most vital import,

therefore I trust I do not presume too much, on the forbearance, and patriotism of this portion of my fellow citizens, by delaying the immediate exercise of this important power, now placd placed in my hands do hands to be desird desired untill until we can see more clearly, the practical operation of this system throughout the state, also whether or not, it is competent to extend the relief desird, without imposeing imposing on the state, the expence expense , or on our representatives of the Legislature, the unpleasant duty, of assembling again, for the purpose of either, correcting, their own errors or that of those on whom, they have imposd this difficult and unpleasant duty___ Should a calld called session be deemd deemed necessary it is surely important, that sufficient information and experience should be had, in relation to the object as to enable the Legislature to know, with greater certainty, than before, what ought to be done, and to enable them to avoid similar errors of equal or greater importance __ In the mean time

you may rest assurd assured that the interest of every portion of the state will be zealously observd observed with readiness for the exercise of any power. with which I am constitutionally or Legally invested, at the such time as it may become indispensible indispensable , to the safety & prosperity of the people of the state, or to rescue them from evils of sufficient magnitude growing out of our Legislative proceedings either directly or indirectly With the highest respect I have the honor to be your obt servt obedient servant N,, Newton Cannon Wm MClain Esqr Prest President & The members of the convention at sparta & others
