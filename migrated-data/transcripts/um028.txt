Columbia Female Institute Oct. October 28th 1840 My dear brother John You cannot imagine how much pleasure your kind and affectionate letter gave me. I had been expecting ⁁ one for so long a time, and had not received any that I can assure you I was very agreeably surprised I would have answered it sooner, but I had Aunt Frances's & cousin Richard's to answer as I received theirs first. I could not write home last week because I had to write a composition. Yo You know that it is very difficult for me to write a letter—anyhow, for I never wrote one by myself before I came here. Mama would always tell me every word to put down— but here I have no person to show me. Brother John please write me how Aunt Narcissa is—if she is entirely well I feel very anxious to hear. Tell her that she must be sure to answer the letter that I wrote to her. Dear Brother you have no idea how very strict they are here. They censure

but I have not received any yet. We set up until 9 o,clock every night to study. We then ⁁ go up in the Dormitory, there is a little ⁁ bell that is rung for us to undress and another for us to go to bed, and if we speak after the second bell rings we are censured in deportment. They ring that bell for us to rise in the morning and again for us to go downstairs. O! it would take fill 5 or 6 sheets of paper if ⁁ I were to tell you all of the rules. Give my love to Mama and Papa, and all of the children, to Aunt Aunt P, and all of my relations and accept the love of your affectionate sister M. J. Mary Jane Chester John Chester Dear Brother Robert You have no idea how much pleasure a letter from you would give me. I have not received a letter from any person this week and I begin to feel very melanc⁁lly melancholy letters now are my only pleasure, Tell Mama I have expecting a letter from her all this week and if I do not receive one soon I do not know what I shall. Tell Aunt that she promised to write to but has written yet. Cousin Jane promised and Cousin Martha Ann. Tell them that I wis wish that they would fulfill their promise.
