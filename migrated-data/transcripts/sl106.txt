Cornplanter April 9th 1840 My dear Margaret , I know how much your warm affectionate heart must have felt in your late severe bereavement, but why you should have been ignorant of its approach, when all the family knew it, You will forgive the Dr. Doctor 's deception when you learn, that he kept Mrs. Hudson in ignorance of her mother's approaching end. My heart is often with you, mingling my tears with yours, over the graves of our lamented parents, the recollection of their many virtues, and the certainty of never again beholding them in this world, so completely overcomes me, that I have frequently to seek a secret place to weep My poor husband has been made to drink so deep of the cup of affliction, that I do not wish to encrease increase his troubles by adding mine, consequently I assume an air of cheerfulness often when my heart is sad. Your letter encreased increased those feelings

when you spoke of Wm.'s William's ill health. I do not know how you all feel on this subject, but I have always had a trembling anxiety lest he should not be a long time with us. My father's age and infirmities requiring just such a person as Wm William has always been necessary to the comfort and happiness of the family. There is nothing could afford me so much pleasure as to hear of his becoming truly pious, and then whether his life be short or long, his surviving friends would have the happiness of refflecting reflecting that death had been his eternal gain. Grief for our departed friends is certainly commendable, if it lead us to a close imitation of their virtues, and to realize the uncertainty of life, and living in a constant state of preperation preparation for death. Let us endeavour to make this improvement of our dear parents death, that we may have reason to say "it is good for us that we have been afflicted." Poor Eveline if we should lose her husband, with her large family she will be entitled to our warmest sympathy. I have not heard from Eliza Smith for some time I frequently wish I had one of you here with me, and did

it not partake too much of a selfish feeling I would urge one of you to come. I have no inducement to offer, but the satisfaction of knowing that your society would add much to my happiness, as there are no other persons whom I could love with the same affection I have always had for you all, so there are none, whose society would afford me so much pleasure — Should you ever be seperated separated from each other, you will better understand my feelings then you can at present. Mr. Bell says I think too much you all, but it has become a part of my nature that I could not love you less if I would. Were you here at present you would most likely take more interest in the improvements which are making then I do— I feel that this world takes up too much of our time that should be given to our eternal welfare Write soon, there is nothing gives me so much pleasure as a letter from home. Mr. Bell unites with me in love to you all. Martha and Theodore send theirs. Ever my dear Margaret , Your affectionate Sister Jane
