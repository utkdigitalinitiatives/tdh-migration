Alexandria ( Louisiana ) 10th July Dear Cousin I have been proming promising myself this pleasure for some time but am so much out of the habit of writing I have not been able to muster resolution enough before this rainy day. and have now no news worth communicating, write merely from the feelings of frindship friendship and to know how you all are and what you are doing in that plentiful country of hog and harring herring . I left my family in the pine woods yesterday all in fine health, our little boy John has got in very fine health running about ( untill until three weeks since our prospects for fine crops have never been better and some places still remain uninjured, in half of my Cotten cotton I am Confident he rest has destroyed half the other half is not so much injured yet, though it is progressing rapidly, its drops it leaves & forms & then dies, we are unable to assign any cause for the disease the returned appearance of the stalk is perfectly healthy but on breaking it you discover the stalk more or less blackened, should it continue ten days longer the crops in the valley of red river will be very much shortened. such crops of corn I have never seen grow in any country I am confident my crop will avarage average sixty buckets to the son

I shall some what calculate on seeing you here this fall or winter and if you have any idea of settling in this country the longer you defer it the worse it will be. the raft is settling rapidly. some risk it on public land others have laid old sparish rickets, land can not be purchased in our section of country except at an enormous price if you come down it is not improbable that we could get a place some distance above Natchetez but as I stated to you before unless you can put on it between thirty and forty hands it would not be very profitable business, you must have a force sufficeintly sufficently large to justify the employment of a good overseer unless you were to remain in the country, we must make money here rapidly or sink rapidly. There has been some warm discussions here relative to the next presidency. I am truely truly sorry there is so great a prospect of a division in the republican ranks there is a considerable split here, I have separated from many of my warm frinds friends in my choice. I have as I believe not only chosen a man eminently qualified for that high station, but one on whom I believe a great majority of the republican party will concentrate, Mr Mister Van Buren is the one he has been nominated by the convention the best means no doubt of tieing the party together, and we should not split I like the motto, United we stand divided we fall.

as for my part I cant support any many who is so strongly supported by nullifiers & bank men as Mr Mister White, should he be elected of which I hope there is no chance, it would not be by the republican party, some of course would support him but his strong support would be from the opposition party a mixture of every thing. his being supported by the frinds of the Bank and nullifiers is a mystery to me I fear there is some thing cloaked in his political feelings adverse to them he has always professed at all events time will prove every thing. Should you not come down and no casualty occur, I shall come up with Sarah some time this winter or spring as she is anxious to visit Tennessee again, I shall want to purchase a few plough boys what chance will there be in your section of country. please have a look out for me. Remember me affectionately to cousin Martha and all my relatives & enquiring frinds friends and accept my best wishes for your health and prosperity in this life Your relative & Frind friend Tho Thomas . O Moore Capt Captain James M King Give my respects to Mr Mister Wilson & say to him that I should be happy to see him.
