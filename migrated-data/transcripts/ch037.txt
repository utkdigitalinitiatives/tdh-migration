Secretary of War in reply to Mr. Kingsbury dated War Department 14th May 1816 Sir, Your letter of the 2d. 2nd instant upon the subject of establishing schools in the Cherokee Nation has been received. The President approves of the undertaking will direct such aid to be given as the laws will permit. In the first instance the agent will be directed to erect a comfortable school house, another for the teacher such as may board with him, in such part of the nation as shall be selected for that purpose. He will also be directed to furnish two ploughs, six hoes as many axes, for the purpose of introducing the art of cultivation among the pupils. Whenever he is informed that female children are received brought into the school, that a female teacher has been engaged capable of teaching them to spin, weave sew, a loom half a dozen spinning wheels as many pair of cards will be furnished. He will be directed, from time to time, to cause other school houses to be erected, as they shall become necessary, as the expectation of ultimate success shall justify the expenditure. The houses thus erected the implements of husbandry of the mechanic arts which shall be furnished will remain public property to be occupied employed for the benefit of the nation. If the persons who are about to be engage employed in this enterprize

should abandon it, the buildings utensils which shall have been furnished may be occupied by any other teachers of good moral character. The only return which is expected by the President is an Annual Report of the state of the school, its progress future prospects. This Report should present the mode of teaching the deviations from that practised in civilized life, which experience shall render necessary. Should you succeed according to your expectations, it is probable that the attention of congress will be attracted to the subject; and that the means of forwarding your beneficent views will be more directly liberally bestowed by that enlightened body. I have the honor to be Your most obedt. obedient very humble servt. servant (signed) Wm H. Crawford Rev. C. Kingsbury
