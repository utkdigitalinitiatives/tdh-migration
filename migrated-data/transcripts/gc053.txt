Alexandria, La, 20th Dec December . 1843 Dear Col Colonel . From laziness and many other causes I have not written you for a long time, and suppose you can alledge allege the same cause as I know you have no other. We have been in fine health all summer & full both whites & blacks, our county has much improved as regards its healthiness, but as to rascality is hard to beat. I have never seen such a summer & fall I dont don't think I have seen the sun shine for three hours in two months. father Millers predictions may be fulfiled fulfilled as regards other parts of the world but assure you it would be difficult to burn red river at this time, all the plantations in the raft are under water and from Alexd Alexandria . down more or less so. and now raining. Crops are bad in the whole valley of the Mississippi & Red river great many falling below half crops, I shall make three hundred bales & ought to have made five, my corn crop is very fine & shall kill between twenty three & four thousand pounds of pork, which will be the greatest abundance for my family, our cotton selling from 7 to 11 Â¢ cents though little as yet at the latter price, although there is no doubt that it will still gradually improve the crop can not exceed 1700,000 Bales that is now pretty well ascertained & large betts bets have been made on that in N New . O Orleans .

I should now be getting in clous close to my waist were it not for my unfortunate endorsements, a damned Coon has got his snout into my purse for six thousand dollars and the only chance to get clear is to pay it for him, I tell you Col Colonel . these devils are not to be trusted, the two any more than the four leged legged ones, is it possible you are determined to die in the sin of Coonery? I pray for you every night & sometimes in the day & do trust that my praying may be heard & that you may yet repent your political sines & his found fighting under the banner of free trade & Equal nights, no duty for protection to any particular class, and nore nor any for them than is requisite for an economical administration of the government. I pray for you Col Colonel . & want you in the Divine ranks, you are the only stray sheep of the blood, return to the fold from which you destened destined and O, how happy you would be, you would be casting off that load that weighs down your Conscience & pressed from you many a tear. The tears are now driping dripping from my eyes for your sinful ways, so I have done. I have had no letter from Sarah or Brothers, is that suit yet terminated? and how is she living? I hope that Brothers is industrious & excerting exerting himself to make a support, please write me what she is most in want of, although my endorsements press heavily on me she shall not suffer so long as I can raise a shilling I hope you will see her frequently & keep her in good spirits, because she is poor she must not dispond. despond

The expenses that have been incured incurred in the suit that Brothers can not pay please write me by Cap Captain when he comes down & I will remit it by him, unless you will take your crop and visit N New . Orleans and I will meet you there any time in January and you can come up home with me, nothing except a visit from father & mother would please us so much as one from you Cousin Patsy & family and every live in hopes to see you on red river . Tell bring Cousin Pamilla & the children Uncle has been in better health this winter than for many years, the balance are well. Bethiah & Em joines joins me in love to Cousin Patsy & family, Tom & family and all the rest of our relations, and accept the best wishes for the good health & happiness of all, and your conversion to true Democracy of your Relative & Friend Tho Thomas . O. Moore Col Colonel King Bethia begs for some more Ciders if an opportunity presents of getting them to Nashville , place them in a Keg & sift the dirt in & then pour water on to make it melt in among the roots is all sufficient
