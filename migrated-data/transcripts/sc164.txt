Knoxville August 6, 1809 Sir I received your letter of the 31 July ult ultimo . I am sorry the Indian Chiefs cannot attend before the 25th of September and what have induced them to postpone the meeting is strange to me_ I have seen several persons out of the nation who, informed me, the Indians were preparing to meet on the 20th of August. I should have no objection to the postponement, did it not interfere with the meeting of the assembly, which convenes on the 18th of September, and my being a member places it out of my power to attend the Treaty, which is absolutely necessary for me to do, as I have been engaged for in making preparations for some time on that head. I am also fearfull fearful that the puting putting off so long will be inconvenient for General Robertson , who I expect is in the nation on his way to the Treaty_ If the Indians cannot
