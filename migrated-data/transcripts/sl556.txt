Cragfont March the 11th 1823 Esteemed Almina, The times are very good here and all goes on with peace and harmony except the occasional bursts of Louisa's Temper which like the halituous of Mt Mount Etna, scatter dread and menacing destruction on the surrounding objects. I am the only one who makes any spirited opposition, every thing else yielding before her. Your departure (as you will suppose) has considerably diminished the number of our visitors; either because Eze's accomplishments are not well known, on the fear of an eruption, keeps those at a distance who would lay siege to her heart. D.L. has spent one day with us since you left here, subsequent to which were our guests have been few. Ensure as many Beaux as you can, for you are likely to lose those you left behind Mr. Trousdale and Mr Mister Sanders are both to be married in a very short time. I find from your letter to father and mother, in which you have attempted to describe your disappointment in the appearance of the City and manners of the inhabitants, that you are not much pleased with either. Val is the same selfimportant self-important personage as ever, never opposing those who would lead him by the nose, except where he is aroused and his dormant passions are brought into action, there as usual, every one gets out of his way as fast as they can some days since Miss Greene paid a visit to the family at the fort, which failed not to set the house in an uproar.

Jim who might have done well has acquired such habits of laziness that nothing can excite him. Having by this time pretty well exhausted my stave, which, bye the bye I have been collecting ever since your departure, and having searched the dictionary in vain for another hard word, I have come to the determination of telling you some thing concerning myself. since you departed hence. I have been a kind of solitary not having much intercourse with anyone. Your absence has deprived me of the pleasure of engaging often in my favorite game of backgammon, of which I have played but one or two hits. The fear of fatiguing my own self particularly, and some little consideration for your patience caution me to forbear Yours NBW

Caroline, I write this in order to thank you for the valuable consignment directed to me, and to free your mind from any uneasiness by assuring you that the floors are scoured once a week at least, and that Val cleans his feet well at the door. you will be glad to hear I suppose that father is having the walk in front of the house curbed and graveled. The books in the great book case are as you left them I believe, none having been removed, but what were again replaced. I would be very much pleased at your return, if you would truly keep your tongue between your teeth when you get here. Mother says it is not worth while for her to say much as you will hear all the news from other persons But she wishes that after the ball is of which you speak that you would come home as she has been uneasy, for fear of an accident ever since you left home she also desires that you will kiss all the children for her and take care of them on your way up the river. Yours NBW P.S. If the flats are very cheap you may procure her one.
