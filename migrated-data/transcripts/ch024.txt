Red Clay Cherokee Nation October 3rd 1830 Messrs Messieurs Majors Major Irwin Major Barron - Gentlemen- The Cherokee people in General Council assembled have disclaimed and most solemnly rejected the Schermerhorn 's nefarious treaty and declared it to be a fraud upon the United States and an act of oppression on the Cherokees , and they have appointed another delegation with full powers to bring the subject again before the Govt of the United States for a final and satisfactory adjustment- this delegation are instructed to confer with the Cherokees West with the view of acting in Concert with us on this important occasion- It is to be hoped, that we may, in the end be able to Convince the high officers of Govt that they have been too long deceived and misled by the joint exertions of some of their own Agents and certain designing individuals, in reference to Cherokee affairs, if so, some thing decisive will be done, more to the honor of the U.S. Govt. and to the sattisfaction satisfaction and welfare of the suffering Cherokees - Policy, common justice and the claims of humanity under existing circumstances, surely cannot longer turn a deaf ear

to the Cries of the oppressed- If we succeed, you may depend upon the integrity of the Nation to act with liberal justice towards you for your legal Services to the Cherokees . Nevertheless, it is hard to kick against the pricks. but my abiding confidence in the magnanimity and ultimate justice of the United States , will not yet permit me to believe that the Cherokees will be be drove away from their homes, their Native land, under the provisions of of a fraudulent unrighteous treaty - I feel it incumbent upon me, therefore, to comply with the Wishes of the great mass of the Cherokees to make a further effort in their behalf. In doing so, I claim to be vindicating the faith and integrity of the US. Govt. as well as the rights and salvation of a weak and dependant people- but If I fail, the disgrace will not be at my hands- nor, will the sting of retributive justice pierce my heart-. I am Gentlemen, very respectfully yr. obt Hble Servt. your obedient Humble Servant Jno John Ross PS. There are certain cases pending in floyd Court in which I am a party have never been tried- the illegal fees collected from me by the sheriff on account of the clerk has never been paid to me according to the decries of Judge Hooper , all of which I trust you will attend to JR John Ross
