Paris February 23rd 1828 My dear Sir— I fear your patience will be exhausted with the number of applications for the office of attorney general for this District. But the situation of the gentlemen who is the subject of this letter is peculiarly interesting God never made a more high minded honorable man, he has fine talents, I granted him a law licence, license he underwent a most excellent examination, he has not long since married a very amiable girl both very poor, & the first fruits of their love is a fine son whom they call Sam Houston . Now you know this son must be raised & educated— Major Terrell has talents sufficient to discharge the duties of the office with great propriety Yours with respect J. C. Hamilton
