New Orleans Head Quarters 7. M. District Fri 31 Jan January : 1815 Sir The express has just reached us with your letter of the 15th & 22d__ Inst Instant I lament exceedingly the situation of your supplies; I did hope that the precautions which had been used, would have prevented a scarcity at any point That I might not be disappointed, I had dispatched Capt Captain William Lauderdale about the 15th October with ample powers to purchase, on the failure of the contractors, & With strict injunctions to push on the supplies with the utmost dispatch to the different points ordered I received a letter from him on his arrival at H Strother, then heard nothing of him since.
