Knoxville, Te. Tennessee June 12, 1837 My dear friend, Yours of the 14th ulto ultimo was forwarded to this place from Flat Rock , and I was very glad to get it. I suppose when you wrote you did not think it would have to follow me about so; but so it is. I have been for some time, a little like Noah's dove which found no rest for the sole of its feet. Lately they have been talking of sending me into Kentucky not to be stationed there however; but whether this is really to be or not, I am not able to tell as yet. So you have become familiar with "dwelling in tents". Well I am not surprised that you should like it better than lodging in the farm houses generally for if they are like some that I have been in, among the Cumberland Mountains , an encampment must be far preferable. One night I staid stayed at a house which had but a single room, one door and I believe no windows. It was quite a chilly night and the openings between the logs and planks were so large, that the air had very free circulation without being subjected to much change of temperature. For supper we had coarse corn bread and butter with buttermilk without any plates and not a remarkably clean table cloth. However as I am not very hard to please about food this did not trouble me a great deal on looking around at my companions, all of whom were to sleep with me in the same room, I found that there were eleven of us in all, viz, the man of the house, his wife and five children,

two young women who had walked five miles barefooted to help plant corn, and a young man besides myself. As there were but two beds visible, I began to wonder how they would dispose of us. From some cause or other they told me to go to bed first; so I obeyed and commenced undressing myself before the women; which was rather an awkward predicament for me to be placed in, being unaccustomed to such proceedings and as you probably know, rather a bashful young man, when with the ladies. The young women appeared to be quite as modest as myself and turned their backs towards me. After getting into bed, the young man who had been at work all day in the field and did not appear to be very clean, was put in with me, and we two had one bed to ourselves. For the young women they spread another on the floor, and most of the rest huddled together in the third. Our bedstead was too short for me to stretch myself upon it. This, the cool air and their covering made me quite glad to take an early departure the next morning. The above specimen, is by no means, a fair criterion to judge the people in this part of the country by. Though mostly plain they frequently live very comfortably and possess a good degree of intelligence. In this place, I find the society, so far as I have had leisure to enjoy it quite agreeable. To be sure they are not so fashionable as the New Yorkers or Bostonians in many respects, yet to me, this is anything but an objection to them . In this respect, I do not agree with all my companions, some of whom, call it a dull and stupid place. When people show a disposition to be atten

tive to strangers and are really so, in proportion to their opportunities. I think it is a hard case, if we cannot be pleased, and make allowances for circumstances. Your cousin whom I mentioned in my last was named Forby , or something like I think and had been employed a short time previously in Bangor with Bedden and McGaffey , contractors. I believe he is a native of Maine and has been at sea a good deal, although apparently not much over 20 years of age. He was perhaps a little taller than you are; but not quite so stout. We left him in Norfolk from which place he said that he intended to proceed to Fayetteville . My duties so far have been to superintend the surveys in this state. At present there are two parties under me, one towards Kentucky and the other towards N. North Carolina . We also have an office in this place. My brother Lewis , whom I hear is rather unwell, Mr Bacet and Mr Wyatt are engaged in this state. We expect to see the Major and Capt. Captain Williams here shortly. There are two Presbyterian Churches in this place. They are very similar to the Trinitarian Congregationalists of N. New England . They had an Episcopal Clergy men here for a short time and tried to form a society; but did not succeed. I wish they had one for the sake of several of our party, who don't seem to enjoy any other form of worship. Remember me to Messrs. Lee and Bennett . Tell the latter if he has not gone to the north yet, that I wish him a great deal of happiness in his intended change. Write soon Yours sincerely E. S. Ellis Sylvester Chesbough

The last time I heard from home, which was about
			 ten days since, they were all as well as usual. In a letter which Father wrote
			 Lewis he mentioned a great many failures among the number, that of 
			 Mr Crary, who was President of the
			 StoringtonCo.Company I suppose you have heard of this
			 before. The finances of our country seem to have got into an awful
			 state. 20 per cent has been given here, for specie, on Bank notes of this
