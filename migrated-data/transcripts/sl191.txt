Knoxville Oct October 6 th 1847 My Dear Friends I for the first time, realize the pleasure of writing to one who has long since secured the love and esteem of your sincere friend. I would have written from Greenville but ⁁ nearly the whole of my time was occupied in visiting our friends Be assured it was not for want of inclination that I did not write but an opportunity. We were disappointed in leaving Greenville as soon as we designed in consequence of all the seats being occupied in the "vast coach" which accommodates the surprising number of persons "Two" This disappointment however was very agreeable. It was the means of procuring a much more comfortable conveyance to this place where we arrived on yesterday afternoon will take the Stage again this evning evening . Thank fortune ! we will be only one night in the 'dear' little thing before we get to Bon Air . Well really we have passed the time since we left home very pleasantly. On the evening we arrived ⁁ at Greenville I attended a party given by one Doct Doctor Williams "a very worthy gentleman" but remarkable for not having seen his feet for many years. which you will not think at all wonderful when I tell you that the famous picture of John Barleycorn is an exact representation of his person and his lady (a woman of the highest excellence) is not inferior in size to her unfortunate husband but what is very astonishing to me is that these enormous personages are the parents of one of the nicest little fellows I have met with for some time

he is not at all handsome but very agreeable a fine musician plays splendidly on the Violin an pretty well on the Guitar! Ask Miss Hudley what she would think of such a gentleman. I could give her opinion but you will enjoy it much more from her. well his name is "Bill" but he is honored with the more dignified appellation of "Prince". — and is related to the Irvin s of Nashville is on his way to that city now will be here in the stage this evening. Several Greenville gentlemen have gone to Nashville. two of whom are slight acquaintances of mine one Mr Bemple a lawyer of considerable repute very talented and rather good looking. the other that abominable Bob Campbell who prevailed on me last summer to accept as a keepsake his miniature I know he is the greatest tease I ever saw though exceedingly polite yet disagreeably attentive. If you should see a gentleman walking about the Streets with a crutch (he is very lame) and a white hat on you may Know it is 'Bob' they Say he is a very clever fellow and I believe he is but unfortunately he has a very amorous disposition and in all his love scrapes (which have been very numerous) he has never ! never ! had the consolation of being "loved". Our latest news from home was not very pleasant Uncle Irvine is very ill with conjestive fever Aunt has almost recovered from the attack under which she was laboring when we left home and something that surprises me very much , is that I am now "Aunt Mary (how old maidish that sounds) Bell imprudently rode several miles in a folding carriage over very rough road which caused premature birth though the "little 'ren" is doing very well they call it Cornelias' for one of my deceased Sisters We will not return through Nashville the weather being fine and the roades good superceeds the necessity of so doing

but I had rather much rather the roades roads were hard for they deny me the pleasure of seeing my friends in Nashville which privilege may never again be afforded. Yet I hope for better things! Uncle Sevier has also been very ill, since I should not be surprised if he does not visit Savannah this fall though he designs leaving home for our town on the tenth if his health permits. You are very lonely now' in the absence of your Ma. Mrs Pope & Jane are gone too. I wrote to Jane while in Greenville but learned through Miss Hudley that she was about leaving the city. therefore did not send my letter. I should like to be with you now' very much indeed have a great many things to talk about a great many questions to ask and some secrets to tell you. I heard from your Cousin Sally Hamilton the morning we left Greenville cousin Mary Jones received a letter from her containing the news of the death of her Uncle Martin, the family was well and Sally particularly well I think she is to be married soon. I have not had the pleasure of seeing any of your relations in East Tennessee, though I have heard from them frequently. Father's health continues good. he desires his compliments to you '& the captain' also to Mrs Hamilton and cousin Joe. Present the same for me. My love to your Ma. Mrs P. and Jane also to Miss Hudley. tell her she may expect a letter from me as soon as I get home. I hope you will write soon and direct to Savannah. I shall always be happy to hear from you. Yours Sincerely Mary Broyles
