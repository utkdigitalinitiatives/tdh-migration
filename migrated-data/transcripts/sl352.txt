Boonville , May 25, 1832 Rev. Reverend Finis Ewing Dear Sir, I have recently received a letter from the A.S.S.U. ? for which the following is an extract "We authorize you, with the advice of Mr. Shackford , V. Vice Pres A.S.S.U. Rev. Mr. Potts , Rev. Mr. Green , (our Missionary,) and the Rev. Mr. Ewing, or a majority of them, to select any number of missionaries or agents not excluding six, of various denominations, (in addtion to those now employed,) and immediately assign them their fields of labor:-- the terms of labor not longer than 6 months, and at salaries of $26 per month." When I left St Louis I expected to have been at your house before this, to seek your advice and aid on this subject-- but I have been providentially prevented. And am now under the necessity of relinquishing the idea of seeing you now. But I have prevailed upon Bro. Brother McKorkle to visit the upper counties for me, and he will be the bearer of this. He will consult you on the subject of obtaining agents or missionaries for Layfayette Lafayette , Jackson , Clay & Ray Counties,- it is necessary that agents or missionaries should be laboring in these counties immediately. Now is the season to have the schools organised organized -- and now is the time to

have the Resolution of the Am. S.S. Union completed. If you can afford us any assistance, or rather if you can do any thing to help forward this work of the Lord-- We will pray that the province may be fulfilled to you-- "He that watcheth ," &c et cetera Revivals of religion are prevailing in some parts of our state-- some Sab. sch. are wonderfully blessed. The cloud is big with drops of mercy--- it is coming this way-- O that it may overspread the whole of our wester Zion. I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you in June or July, as I expect to return to these parts in a few weeks. Heavens chorus & blessing descend upon you & yours-- so prays your abundant servant in the Lord. A. Benton Agent A.S.S.U.
