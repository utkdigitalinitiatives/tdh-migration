Knoxville 2d April 1796 Friends and Brothers It is some time since I talked to you upon paper and living so great a distance from each other, we can seldom speak face to face I am lately come to this place, and us yet not acquainted with all the things that have happened for some time past. I am sorry to hear that some of my red Breathen Brethren are missing or lost if it is the case we cannot as yet find out who it is that have done so wrong and black a deed but when it is known our laws will then punish him with death It is very wrong to punish the innocent for the fault of rogues and bad men neither will it bring back our friends that sleep in the dust; it is enough for one to be lost by bad people, and not a great many perhaps on both sides was either of us, to begin to take satisfaction, for you know every person have their friends you that are men and warriors must listen well to my talks and not let foolish and inconsiderate people brake break the white belt of

Peace, that now so happily extends from our hearts to those of our red brothers. Dont think harm when I say you are all only a handfull handful of people, and that war will ruin you if ever you enter into it again. look back thirty years ago, you was then a great people, more then ten times the number you have now, and if you had never went to war you would have been ten times stronger now, then you was at that time. Brothers you know I have always advised you to live in peace, I pitied your women and children and warriors ought always to take care of them, for they are harmless and innocent, and depend upon men for their safety and protection. I shall always endeavour to keep the path of peace wide and straight between us, and if ever war is again known in your land, it will not be our fault. Your Good and great friend Governor Blount is going to Philadelphia to set in the great and beloved Council of America your beloved Father Washington the President is there, and so long as your Nation keeps bright the chain of peace, they will both be your friends. Your friend and Brother signed John Sevier
