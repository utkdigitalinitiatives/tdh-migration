Rhea have taken the measures you both advise me of as to the subject of my land in Overton and the affour affair of Hill- they are laying very scheime scheme in their power to get that property out of my hands by some ronquish relinquish scheime or others, I must contrive some new schieme if I live to see you again, in order to have all the suits on that property carried up to the Federal Court, and not longer be pestered in the State Courts. The chesapeake is full of British shiping shipping and troops; they have landed a large body of troops near norfolk , but have been roughly handled in so doing; four or five Boats were sunk and as many taken, a number killed, wounded and taken prisoners. It is said that nearly two whole companies departed them and come over I expect the times are very warm about Norfolk - Our coasts are lined with the enemies fleets, and no doubt they will make grand excertions exertions in every quarter- Our troops have been very success full in Canada .
