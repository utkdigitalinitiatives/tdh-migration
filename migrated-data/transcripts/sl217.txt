Nashville Tuesday 17/43 January 17, 1843 My dear Mary I had this pleasure yesterday by mail, and this morning an opportunity offers to send over Henry and the Brussells Carpet — I am somewhat at a loss to say when I shall invite⁁ for you ⁁ to come over, but at present think you had better remain where you are until the beginning of spring — When I hope we shall meet, not soon to be parted again — I am about paying my expenses ⁁ at present but so soon as the weather becomes more favorable I shall no doubt have as much as I can do and during my leisure moments I am reading medicine in a regular way. Doctor Ford is here, and has offered me his Libra Library and any assistance in his power— or that I may want in taking a regular course of reading. You know me well enough, my dear Mary — to convince you that I dislike to know less than any one else in any profession I may embrace in fact my ambition leads me to climb to the top— Old Mr McNairy "says he will bet" Two hundred thousand dollars— that I will be a better Physician (Nuntically) in two years, than any in our city — save Doct Doctor Jenning?

The means I already possess in that way will be sufficient to keep yourself and boy above the frowns of the world — so much for so much about self — I hope Mother will be able to get along with Henry, as he is now sufficiently large to do anything that she may want done situated as she is— We send the carpet, thinking Mother will take better care of it, than can be done here— Mr Bowman (my patient) that I informed you ⁁ of as being so much afflicted is getting well— I cured a case in ten days, that has baffled the physicians here for two years. It was a negro boy. He is larger and sturdier than Henry every way, and on account of his disease sold on the Block about two weeks since for 151$ one hundred and fifty one dollars — his master R. N. Greene would not take four hundred for him— Mrs Duncan and Ellen left for Mississippi Madison County — on the Kirkman on Friday last — William Stodhart will leave in a few days by land with the Negroes and other property I have nothing new— Ellen Ervin is anxiously expecting a letter from you. If you will send her letter over to me — I will answer

it if you have concluded not to do so— Tell James his Papa says he must be a good boy, love and mind Ma and Grand ma and talk and think a good deal about his Papa. I heard from Alabama last week — all well — All well at the Ridge afore? days since— and we are all well here — By the spring (with good luck) I hope I shall be as bright as a new dollar. Make my best love to Mother and our relations around you, My respects to the Dawsons , Trumans , and Russells friends. Kiss James for me. May heaven protect, guide and direct us through life; in such and that "Our light afflictions here" May work out for us a far more exceeding weight of glory in the world to come.
