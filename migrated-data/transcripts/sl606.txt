that confined the seder oil to his finger [unclear] entirely in the flesh his finger never matted any more after the application mortification progressed verry fast after the application of the oil It is my opinion that the applying the seder oil to the inflammed inflamed finger of Mr. Dinning was a great agent in taking of his life I further state that if Mr. Dinning & his father mother and some other wold would have permitted an amputation Mr. Dinning wold have stood a good many chances to have lived but they were anxious for his boddy body to go with his arm from what Mr Dinning told me he must have acted verry imprudently after he recd received the wound Peter W.
