Clarksville, Tenn. Tennessee Jany January 7, 1844 My Dearest Annie Another week has passed since I had the pleasure of writing to you. & I am only 45 miles from where I was then. so you see I am not getting home very fast but I have had a busy week of it & a more fatiguing one than any I have previously had, but thank God I have arrived here in safety without meeting with any accident & in good health. On monday Monday I remained in Nashville. called upon my acquaintances there, & was introduced to most of the largest opperators operators in Produce by Col. Colonel McEwen . it rained nearly all day, but still I was on the go from morning til until night. I received some encouragement from several houses, but as but very few will say that they will possitively positively ship to us. I cannot tell what to depend upon. I wish there was more certainty in it. I want to know what we can depend upon, but that cannot be, & we must trust to Providence that we shall have enough after having ⁁ done all we can do to succeed, & me conscience bears me witness that I have exerted my ⁁ self to the utmost to promote the success of our undertaking, & I trust in God it will not be altogether thrown away. I wish to succeed in business so that my family may live comfortably, & not be at all dependant upon your relatives, & I am anxious to pay what I am owing to Uncle John , I cannot say that I have any great desire to ⁁ be very rich, but I wish to be independant independent . you know my feelings on this subject, & you can readily

imagine my anxiety to succeed in this business, aside from the unpleasant idea of being unsuccessful in what I undertake — on Monday evening I took tea with Mr Yeatman . they live in handsome stile style . & are very pleasant people, although I was there but a short time, as I had letters to write in the evening — on tuesday Tuesday morning at 4 O'Clock I left Nashville in the stage for Bowling Green Ky. Kentucky & reached there "between sundown & daylight down" just as the driver said we should — I got along very comfortably that day. the next day I remained in B & attended to my business there, but the next morning I left there in a common cart drawn by 4 horses. it had no springs nor top & very low sides, so that I had to sit on a mail bag & hold on the best way I could, & then was danger of my being jolted out continually, going over the terrible bad road, very rocky & muddy. the weather too was quite cold. I continued in it for 12 hours until I reached Elkton , where I found I could save considerable travel in it by taking a horse there the next day & going this Trenton to Hopkinsville , & as a friend said he would lend me one, & the driver of the cart promised to bring him back. I sent my valise on & remained there until the next day. & as I was sore all over I was glad to get out, the next day I left on horseback I rode 25 miles to H. Hopkinsville the first part was very pleasant, but after a little which I became quite sore from that as I had not been in the habit of riding for so long, & when I dismounted about dark, I was very stiff, felt worse if any thing than I did the previous night, but after a good nights sleep I felt better. I remained there the next day (yesterday) attended to my business, & this mor ⁁ n ing before 3 O'Clock I left in a buggy without a top, but had springs, it rained & I was obliged to carry an umbrella, but it stoped stopped after we had been out an hour or two — the road was excessively bad. we

would go first down one side then the other in the ruts, & often the mud was up to the axles. I arrived here about 10 O'Clock & then got my breakfast, not having had anything until then but an apple I had in my pocket. So you can form some idea how delightful it is to travel in this country at this season of the year. the cart & the buggy were run instead of stages — How do you think you would have borne it if you had come along as you wished to. you could not have lived through it, but thank God I have a strong constitution & can bear a great deal of fatigue, but I congratulate myself that I am over the worst part of my journey if the Ohio dont don't freeze up before I can get up but that little word is in the way & may trouble me considerably, but I have but little to do off from the rivers provided I can get along them. I have to stop at a considerable number of places, but if I h very good luck I hope to see you about the first of Feby. February how glad I shall be when I get there. I want to see you so much. it will indeed be lovely when we once more get settled down in our own house again. I shall not wish to leave it again unless my dear Annie & my little Rebecca goes with me. I look forward with a great deal of pleasure to our meeting again — I am very anxious to hear from you as the last letter I recd received from you was dated Dec. December 2 . I hope to get 2 letters when I reach Smithland which will probably be by next Sunday. I hope & trust you are all well. do take good care of yourself. be careful of your eyes. I wonder if I should know you if I should meet you in ⁁ the street with you new bonnet & coat on — I expect you you look very fine. have you engaged your girls yet? I think I would not take Wilhelmina if you can get any other good girl. she stutters so bad. it is very unpleasant for me to hear her talk, but do as you think best about it — I was at the Episcopal Church this afternoon. it was rather a pretty church but a small congregation, a tolerably good minister. I expect to remain here tomorrow, then shall take the first boat down the Cumberland, stoping stopping at Dover & Eddyville , & from that place shall go horseback 12 miles to Princeton , back again

then to Smithland , from there I shall go up the Ohio, stopping at several places, at some places I dont don't stop as long as I ought to, but I am so anxious to get along. I hurry off. I have no doubt it would have been better for me to have remained longer in Nashville . The day I was there (New Years) was a busy day & a very anxious one for many of the poor blacks. there were 3 or 4 auctioneers in the Market house all the forenoon either selling or hiring ⁁ them to the highest bidder. that is one of the worst features of the system of slavery — Jany January 9, 1844 I have kept this until now as the mail does not leave till until this evening. I am now on a boat & expect to leave for Dover in a few minutes. I am well. Good bye my dear one. give my love to all the members of the family & a kiss to little sis sister — Yours affectionately Chas Charles E. Haven 25 Mrs. Chas. Charles E.
