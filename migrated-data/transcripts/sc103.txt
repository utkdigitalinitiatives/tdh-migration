Washington 22 January 1815 Dear Sir Your favor of the 8th instant has just come to Hand and am rejoiced to hear from you all, but am sorry to find that the ulcer in your neck seems to continue so obstinate, you will have to be very carefull careful how it is managed, and to be in time with it, no time ought to be lost. I am very glad to hear that Major McClellan have arrived, and hope his disorders will leave him now he has got home- the major is promoted to the 16 Regiment of Infantry commanded by Colo Colonel Pierce, and now on the lines, was raised in Pensylvania . We have passed the bank bill, but it remains yet to be assented to by the President, It is not believed it will be usefull useful to the government, it has been modeled intensly intensely by the Minority. additional Tax's is proposed to the secretary of Treasury. probably to makeup for the deficency deficiency in the bank, which wont afford any relief to the fiscal measures of government. I need not give you any news from orleans as you will hear from that place before we can. it is thought that there either have or will be, a number of black troops introduced into the Southern States. I fear we shall be much embarrassed respecting money to supply the army, and dont don't know in what way it can be guaranteed now

now the bank have so much failed, we before had calculated very much upon that institution, but the hope is wasted - It is supposed we must have reconvine reconvene to Treasury notes, and it is to be feared that so much paper will soon become Much depreciated - I wish you to write Colo Colonel . Sparks & Rutha to bring off their negroes & property as quick as possible, and while they can pass in safety through the Indian Country. I shall be very uneasy about them till they arrive and shall fear much on their account. I have observed what you say respecting my suit at Moabile Mobile , and shall send on by this mail a power to Willson making him my attorny attorney in fact. Shall also write General Gains to have an eye to the business, and wish you also to do the same. I dont apprehend there is any danger of your Regiment being transferred, as to the Colo Colonel that wants to be at the head of it, I cant believe any thing like that of a gentleman - the secretary at war have been dangerously ill, and yet very much indisposed, so that no sickness can be transmited in that department. I shall use all possible means to do something to settle that business with Kings executon execution - I wish Mr Mister . Rheaculan make some sales - He wrote me some time ago he had made some, to the amount of four or five hundred dollars, and expected to make more If you dont don't come on until first of april, I suppose I shall not have an opportunity of geting getting my mair mare - I am still enjoying good health, but closely surrounded with sickness - Yr Your affectionate father My affectionate regards to all our friends John Sevier Colo Colonel Sevier
