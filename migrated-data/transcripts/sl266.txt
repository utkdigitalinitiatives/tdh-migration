Greenville July 17th 1800. Dear Sir, I am now within one days ride of you and should be extreemly extremely glad to see you but cannot venture farther from home at this time. I received two letters from you, for which I thank you, but have had no opportunity of returning answers. As to money I can assure you it is hard times, so much so indeed that I should think myself acting improperly should I fix upon any time for you to expect the money I owe you. If you could purchase land for horses I would let you have one or two very low, even at your own price. Judgments were obtained against me at the last term in Nelson for upwards of $400, for which much of my property I expect will be sacrificed, unless preserved by the interposetion interposition of friends, and they are scarce. My school is not large a consederable considerable part, of the proceeds of which, goes to support my little family; the balance to my creditors . What is the meaning of all this? "Have patience with me and I will pay you all." With this letter I send you two pamphlets. Accept of them as a small token of my regard; read them, and then write to me your opinion upon the performances —

With regard to our election I have not much to say. From the best information I am able to get upon the subject in our bounds the contest will lie between Lewis and Rowan. You may easyly easily Conceive for whom I shall vote when I tell you that laying aside personal attachments and personal enmities I feel myself bound in conscience to vote for the man whom I believe to be best qualified to fill the office, Viz. Videlicet to serve my country. — I hope, my dear Sir, that in politicks politics as well as religion you will dare to think for yourself. Form principles by extensive investigation and mature deliberation and give no man reason to hope that he can allure you, flatter you or force you out of the pathes paths of rectitude. Test men by measures and not measures by men. I am informed Mr Edwards has declined his pole and the King of Beasts of course will be elected in your district. What a pity that your district is in a dilemma. Either elect the King destitute of decency, talents and good principles or by electing his opponent ruin your own reputation as a district both in point of morals and good sense. You may thank Mr. E Edwards 's declinature for this doleful situation. The people in the Atlantic states now

believe that the King of Beasts in the first instance imposed himself upon the people by electionering electioneering tricks and the very charming name Republicanism and that now it is difficult is difficult to get him shut out, but shut out by a man of no more respectability than Mr W the dignity of your district will be gone forever and a day. Amidst all that hustle through which we pass through life let us never forget that "One thing is needfull needful ." How altered would our world be if all men were using even as much diligence to make their heavenly calling and election sure as our candidates for congress are to secure their election to that house where a number of great, wise and sensible consult about earthly things. I left my family in health last Sabbath eve'ning evening . Mackey is beginning to spell off the book tolerable well and to read in the ⁁ easy places in the spelling book. I cast Mr. Downs in my suit at Hartford and of course will be clear of one troublesome wreck so soon as I get my costs out of him. Often write to Joshua L Wilson
