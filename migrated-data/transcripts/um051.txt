Two young gentleman Mr Taggs friends stroke up with Miss Harriet Miller and Miss Frank .

They were ⁁ married on the night of the 1st of March by Rev Reverend G. W. Coons , (who married the others) at our house, it rained like fun, just poured down, nobody here but Mr Coons, Mr & Mrs Garrison and home folks. Nobody knew anything about it until just at sundown, when Aunt Eliza always ready commenced making the wedding cake, and getting supper. Everything went off fine. I could fill this letter by enlarging on the merits of said marriages but time and paper will not allow, but I am in hopes to give you the particulars by the word of mouth soon.
