Frankfort 27th June 1803 Sir In conformity with the provisions of an act of the congress of the united states , passed in the year 1793, entitled "an act respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters," I have transmitted to your Excellency an affidavit made before a magistrate of this state, charging a certain Robert Wiley with felony and have certified the said affidavit to be authentic. Information has been communicated to me, and is indeed fully corroborated by the affidavit of Mr Mister Early, that the said Robert Wiley, being a fugitive from the justice of this state, was apprehended in consequence of the charge exhibited against him by Mr Early, & committed to the district jail in Nashville . It is therefore my request that he may be delivered to David Early , whom I have appointed agent to receive and conduct him to this state, and that your Excellency will be pleased to consider this request as an official demand of the said Robert Wiley, as a fugitive from justice, under the authority of the before mentioned act of congress.
