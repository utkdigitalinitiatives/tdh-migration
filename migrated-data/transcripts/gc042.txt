I left Bethiah my two boys and fine daughter in the pine hills this morning all as fat as beans & as unmanageable as mustangs Crops are generally pretty good though we have considerable must should the season continue good from this time we shall make good crops, I have in about 400 acres of cotton & if nothing happens expect to make 400 bales though you know there is no certainty of a cotton crop untill until you get it in the house, I shall make the greatest abundance of corn though it is not so good as last year owing to the drouth drought of 38 days duration at the very time our corn most required it.

I wish you to read John C. Wums ' (of Maryland ) letter to him & see if that dont satisfy you that Clay is to all intents & purposes an Abolitionist, I would almost as soon support J. Q. Adams or Arthur Tappan (enough of this horror). Tell cousin Patsy, Bethiah says her Louisiana girl can beat hers as far as from here to Loudon . Give my love to cousin P. Sarah. aunt B & sister Jane & families & tell the girls I have not forgotten them that I will tie them head & foot next time.
