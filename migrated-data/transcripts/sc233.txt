Estillville Sunday Evening August 23rd 1835 Dear Sir I have just arrived at home, and having learned that there are several negroes, for sale in the lower edge of Smith Co . I have determined on going there as early as possible. I shall start in the morning. I therefore write you now, last I should not return in time for a letter to reach you at Nashville . Mr. Sanders has 2 men that he has sent me word he will sell if I will say to his wife I want them for my own use and he has said he could and would purchase 15 (mostly all grown) of Col Colonel . Thos Thomas . Tate

As I returned through Rogersville I left with Mr Brown gave Bradly $1500. which he promised me he would lay out in a few days for negroes of the right kind, he has a farm in the country and can buy as if for his own use without being suspected. Bradly is the Shff Sheriff . of the Co County . and can purchase if he will (which I have no doubt he will do) to advantage. I can.. got the promise of 2 a man and a girl as I came on to day from a cousin of mine, but it being Sunday he would not close the trade I calculate certainly on getting them. I think the chance good for several of the right kind I shall lay out all the money I have as early as possible and all we can raise. I will write you immediately on my return from Washington
