Head Quarters Nashville 15th April 1819 Sir Owing to my absence from Head Quarters your several communications bearing date the 29th December January 2d 9th 12th 16th 29th Feb February 27th and 1st of march with their accompanying Documents were not received until a few days since The course you have pursued in relation to the conduct of the Commandants of St Augustine meets my highest approbation. The reoccupation of the Floridairs by the Spanish authorities precludes the possibility of my adopting any other measure, either with regard to the confinement of Serj Serjeant Lanter , or the supplying of the Hostile Indians with ammunition, than to report the circumstances to the Department of War. I hope however such unwarranted aggression will not be tacitly born by our Government I regret the embarrassments you must have sustained in consequence of the want of funds

in the Quarter Masters Department, but I presume you have been joined by an Officer of that Department previous to the present date. If however I should be mistaken in this supposition, be pleased to advise me of the fact, as early as practicable and an Officer with funds shall be ordered forthwith to your relief. You have doubtless seen the Report of the Committee of the Senate on the Seminole Campaign and without the Diposition Deposition of (the Agent) Mitchel in which he labours labors with and regard to truth, to prove that, the late hostility of the Indians orrijinated originated in your attacked on Foul Fawn, I have done every thing in my power to vindicate your character, from this base and malicious charge, if you possess any documents in relation to this subject forward them to me, and they shall be placed in the proper Channel for your defence I have the Honor to be Respectfully your Obt Serv Obedient Servant Andrew Jackson Maj. Genl. Major General E. P. Gaines
