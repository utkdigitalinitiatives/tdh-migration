Cumberland County Va Virginia March 7th 1839 Sir, Your letter of the 2nd Decr. December 1838 was not received until the 2nd Inst. Instant This delay was produced by its being sent to the Court House, where I have not been for the last five years, and by its falling into the hands of a Loco foco Locofoco Post Master, who, although it was marked "PAID" was unwilling to give it up until he was paid. I expect some of my grand-sons will pull this sub-treasurer's nose. Should you have any further correspondence with me, direct to "Raine's Tavern Cumberland Va" to which place I send every Wednesday and Saturday and get every thing brought for me by the mail PAID or not paid. You will observe from the dates of the papers that I have lost no time in dispatching the business since it came into my hands, and I hope I have done it to your satisfaction Here follows a short history of the old man's life. I am one of the old Revolutioners Revolutionaries of '76 and in the course of the War_ including skirmishes_ was in ten battles. I was one of the forlorn hope who took the Hessians at Trenton on the 28th December 1776 . I am now making my 83rd year and have been a Baptist going on 54 years. I have my coffin and my shrowding shrouding clothes ready and am waiting for death as you would wait for a beloved friend, and can heartily join the apostle Paul in saying, "for me to live is Christ but to die is gain." If there is any thing to in this world

to see the milk that I helped to dra of the pail. Being an old soldier, I feel assured that I should be welcomed to a seat, at your 4th July celebration, were I in Tennessee ; but, as I cannot be there I trust that some permanent whig (yourself, if you be such) will gratify me so far as to the present to the company, the two following toasts, from an old Revolutionary soldier of the Virginia line. 1st. "Uncompromising hostility to Van Buren , and all the Expungers." 2nd. I observe you are about to run Polk for Governor. "I give my vote for him to be camp cullyman and let his occupation be_ to lead the corporal's dog to s__t." You may also, _if you choose, present the following _ " White , Bell , Bailie Peyton and the whole band of Tennessee Whigs_ They have made a glorious struggle in a trying hour, for which they have my warmest gratitude." Please to present my compliments to my Brother's widow and family, and say to them, that our family connexions connections are generally well_ that James Blanton has recently lost his oldest daughter, the wife of my grand-son Anderson Walker . Say also that I have, now living, twenty-five great grand children_ that the negros which I brought from your state, when there in 1820, (a man, his wife and four children) now number 18 and would sell now, in this state, for $15,000. I am respectfully &c et cetera yours William Walker
