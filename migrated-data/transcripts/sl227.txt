Pulaski June 7, 1850 Dear Mary I am at last here, after quite a fatigueing fatiguing trip through the hills of this county but am in good health— Yet have not been successfull successful in finding several of the agents at home— I am also afraid that "Tom" is a little foundered his feet are very tender to say the least of it— I shall however continue my journey onward if only in a slow way— I wrote to you from Columbia which letter you have no doubt received I am beginning to realize the old and oft often repeated sentiment— that there is no place like home with wife child & friends— I am however underway and shall by the aid of a divine presence continue my journey. I have not met with anything of a character sufficiently novel or interesting to write to you about— My thoughts are upon you and my business which I shall endeavor to accomplish— I have not been able to sell yet owing to the demand for everything being dull— I shall make an extra effort in Alaba Alabama I shall write to you again from athens but when
