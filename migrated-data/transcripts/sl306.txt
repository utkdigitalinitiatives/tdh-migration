Washington June 2 18 37 Dear Sir, Mr Edwards informs me that Mrs. Cobb s, claim for a pension is suspended on account of the want of satisfactory proof of the service of her husband, and of her marriage before the termination of his service. It is now so late in the session that no action of any importance can be had in congress upon the petition of Mrs Cobb, and I have concluded to delay its presentation until the session,_ It is a very difficult matter to get these claims through & if the proof which Mr. Edwards requires could be possibly obtained, it would be far better

than to place her claim before congress. many claims of this kind have been before congress for many years & have not yet been acted upon_ I have no news only that our John Bell , struck Turney of our State yesterday, in the House of Representatives _ Bell was speaking & Turney, rose up near him & stated that he B Bell stated a false hood, & B in quick time hit him a blow or two,__ they were separated, & all soon became quiet & B proceeded with his speech. we will adjourn about the 1st July Very Respectfully your Obt Srt Obedient Servant W B Campbell A Fergusson Esqr Esquire Carthage Tenn Tennessee
