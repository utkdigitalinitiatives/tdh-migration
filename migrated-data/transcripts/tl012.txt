if I live to the 2nd day of August next I shall be Eighty six Eighty-six years old, so I hope you l you'll Excuse my Enterlining Interlining c et cetera but Mrs Fogg has attem p ted to give a history of the mercey mercy of God, to so unprofit able a mortal as I have Ever been to society there is one ne a ver been penned , is one as strong as that has been penned . I went to East Tennessee on Buisnes Business in the winter of 1793 and on My Return got in company with Col Colonel Robert Hay n s e a Brother in law Brother-in-law of General Jackson and When we got to Knoxville , the night before a Trader and William Blunt Blount , then Governor , or Governor , Sevear Sevier Sevier , I do not k now which was Governor of the Teretory Territory at that time ; this Cherrokee Cherokee Trador Trader informed them that a large Bodey Body of Indians was a bout about start (paper is torn at end of word) to way lay waylay the tra s c e Com e ing to Nashvill Nashville and we had better turn and Come by Kntuckey Kentucky . w e done so and the 2nd night we got in three miles of the last house, and I had a Negro Woman a long along and we Concluded not to Eat BreaKfast to we Would go there and then not stop to night ; but when we Went to start , the horse the Negro Rode was badly [ foundered , a gentlman gentleman ong along said , if I would bleed him at the Edge of the hair round around his feet he would be well in a mile or two I requested him to do it for me, he attempted to do so but the horse was was ver r y wild and Jrked Jerked up his foot and the Knif e went into the arter y in the front of his foot and I made the woman ride my hors e and I walked and Drove the foundered one to the last house . h e Bled all the way and while the Company was Eating I got some cobwebs and held on it , and stoped stopped the blood we then started up Clinch Mounten Mountain road but before we got halfway up

Page 3

the mounten mountain it broke to B l eeding as fast as Ever and I Knew I should lose my horse if I went on .] I observed to Col Colonel Ha y se that I woul would be glad he would take charge of the Negro woman as I hade had to stop with my horse and She had provison provision a nough enough to do her to Nashvel Nashville but he would have to buy some corn for the horse in Kantuckey Kentucky . h e said he wou l d do so Cherfuly Cheerfully for my Broth er William had saved his life two years before , at Emreys River proably probably 12 miles from Kingston , East Tennessee , a large Bodey Body of Indians fired on them a boute day brak about daybreak , as the they were waking awaking out of sleep . the y Indians Rushed on them , it was a of a mile to Emreys River t he y Ran to the River . m y Brother was shot in the back of his Righ t hand and the Ball Came out at his W Rist but he got his clothing of f and tied them with his hand kerchief handkerchief to a chunk, but not being tied good and the Riffeling riffling of the water the hankerchief handkerchief came lo o se and at that instant person Col Colonel . Hayse was a sinking gust just before him he caught his shirt in his teeth and he being a good swimer swimmer gave his Chunk to Hayse and by that means both lives were saved , tho although my Brother had lost three fine horse s and all his money and clothing but his shirt . b ut it was only 12 or 15 miles to the settelment settlement . a fter Hayse g i ve the a bove above information the Company started and I stayed with my horse and held the wound to till until it began to swell . t hen I led him Back to the fort and stayed there one wek week to my horse got well and the Post Rider Thomas Ross and Col Colonel Friley came a long along and as they lived in Kaintucky Kentucky I conclude

Page 4

if they could gow go safe I could, accordinly accordingly we started the next Morning and went on all day ve a ry well but the 2nd day a bout about two a Clock o'clock on the East side of littel Little Sorrel River we ware were fired on by a part e y of Indians We Dashed forward a bout about 150 yards to the River it did not swim (inkblot) us at the ford . t he Ro a d e led up the River tho though a littel little distance from the River and in a bout about the a of mile it came near the Road a gain again , and at that plase place a littel Harricn little Hurricane had cros ed crossed the Ro a d e the sum m er before but the g u ard that went threw through to protect the Traveller had the cut the limbs of the fallen trees so that the pack horses could g i t a long along , Rosses Ross's horse creature could out Run outrun my hors e I think he was a rod a head ahead of me . ust just as we Enterd Entered the fallen timber an Indian from behind a tree fired at him and I suppose shot his creture thro creature through the Ear for she was shot threw through the Ear she Whealed wheeled back and at the y fired on Ross me , Friley said ther there was twenty or thirty guns fired at us two , for Friley was forty yards behind but our hor horses scaring at the screaming of the Indians and guns and dodging the misd they missed us boath both . w e Dashed back and met Frily Friley and we all Came in a breast abreast to a large fallen tree and I was on theft the left and Ross in the middel middle and as Rosses Ross's mare as charged the log her four feet went in to into ground so she fel fell on her Brast Breast , and then on her side and he went over her head and his gun fell out of his hand he spran d g to his gun and looked at his mare and I suppose he thought she was killed for I Expected mine to fall Evry minuite Every minute the kept missing me so much and that was the last I seen of him I then Reiend Reined my horse to pas pass the Bend of the Rive River Friley hollerred hollered at me not to gow go there for he said when the y fired on Ross and me in the Hurrican e he seen the trees all lined with Indians betwean between me and the River I then made for the River and when I came to it

Page 5

it was a high caving bank I turned down the River but it got no better four or five feet to the wat t er . Friley Hollorred Hollered to me that he was wounded , and for me to charg e my horse down the bank or they would have us I answerd answered him that I was wounded also and turned my horse toward the River . he sailed of off as tho though it was level ground the first plung e took me Round the middel middle in swimming wat t er . he then took Down the River with me and unc I could do I could not turn him . a t length I hit him with my left hand on the side of his head and that turned him as my Right arm fel fell dead when the Ball Struck me and I would have left him in River but I was fearful that I could not swim out with one hand having my over Coat overcoat on and I thought the horse was shot and dying but I thougt thought I would trey try to mak make him Carrey Carry me to the shore and when he got to the bank it was slate bank he got a boute about half way up the the bank . H e got a bout about half way half-way up the the bank and fel fell and I thot thought he was dead and sprung of f him and shoved my over Coat overcoat of f the point of my shoalder shoulder to Run and at that moment I seen aw Rosses Ross's mare Nearing the bank. I caught my coat again and pulled it up and made for Rosses Ross's mare, and as she pased passed me I got hold of the Brid al le . i t was a mong among her feet tho though not tangled I put it over her head and sprung on her and Came of f on her

Page 6

and as I Raised the Bank I seen aw Friley a gowing going over the hill more than a hundred yards a head ahead Altho although he went after me into the river and it Did not Swim him, and he had a low bank to rise. i f my horse would have gone straight a Cross across he would have the same low Bank but as I mounted Roses Ross's mare I started the Course I seen aw Frily Friley a gowing going after going fiftey fifty or sixtey sixty yards I look Round to see if I could see aney any of the Idians Indians that first fired on me on that side of the Rive River and dscovered discovered my own horse Right at heals my hea ee ls . I checked my mare a moment to he pased passed me and I heard the scream after him and turned him the way I seen Friley go w and directly struck his trail it was post oak land and the Indians had Bur n t the laves of leaves off the ground his mare had thrown up the White clay as he Run so I could see his trail for thirtey thrity yards a head ahead I could see the Blood on Bushes where he pased and in bout about the of a mile I over took overtook him he had stoped stopped in a littel little Sunk pla s c e, he said he was so sick he would be obliged to git get down. I oberved observed to him if you git get down you neaver never will git get up again for the Indian will be hear here in les less than five minutes and besides that your ho r se is shot in his th ey ighs he may not Carrey Carry you twenty minutes, shove him as long as you Can . h e then observed , go a head ahead , and I will try to keep up I went of off East probably a mile and turned north and struck the River a gain again at som some Buffelow Buffalo licks which I was informed after I got in the settelment settlement was five miles from the ford where I had cosed crossed , the River there was a small stream

Page 7

not belley belly Deep on our horses and after I had crosed crossed I seen my horse had stoped stopped to eat some kain cane that was on the bank I then turned back and caught my own horse he had lost the rains reins of my Bridel le . I then pulled the Bridel le of f Rosses Ross's mare and put it on my own horse and Drove the mare threw through the River and Requested friley Friley to Drive her after me he said he was so sick he could not but she would follow us, she had the mail on and his Blanket sircingeled surcingled on Just as he left her I went on a westerly course and in les less than a mile we struck the Rode Road person Friley was so deranged he wanted to take the Rong Wrong end of the Rode Road I informed him that I would not keep the Rode Road any further I Enquired Inquired of him the Cours Course to the settelment settlement of Kaintuckey Kentucky as I had neaver never been there he said it was a but about a sun set sunset course if I know which way (hole in page) that was a beutiful beautiful Clear day and at that plase place the Rode Road was a gowing going right north I went right a cros across the Rode Road took up a long hill and gust just as I got to the top of the hill I struck a path leading westerly which I thought was a Buffelow Buffalo path leading to a lick and from there I could git get a path leading almost aney any course for miles but after I had followed it , povibelly probably half a mile it began to give out and supposed the main path was to the Right and took down a point of the Ridge and had not gone more than of a mil mile before I seen a fresh parsel of logs puled pulled up by the side of a big log I conclude som some Indian had died and the they had coverd covered him up there and I would gow go and see but when I got there I got down and seen it was a White man. I then looked
