(Copy) Executive Department Nashville Novr Novembere 26th 1839 __ Hon Honorable J. R. Poinsett Secretary of War Sir I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 14th Instant, informing me that a draft drawn some weeks since, for the interest due on the 1st of July last on $250.000 in Tennessee state Bonds, held by the Government of the United States , in trust for the Cherokee Indians had been protested at the Girard Bank in Philadelphia , with the reason assigned that nothing but current Philadelphia funds would be paid for it, and requesting that such instructions may be given to the agent of the state, as will ensure the prompt payment of the amount in question ($6.250), as well as the interest to fall due subsequently. The Union Bank of Tennessee has heretofore acted as the agent of the state in making the payment of the semi-annual interest on these Bonds, and has uniformly made provision for its payment at the Girard Bank in Philadelphia, as it fell due

The President of the Union Bank insists, that the Bank has discharged her duty, by making the deposit in species at the Girard Bank, to meet the payment which fell due on the 1st of July, and that the loss or inconvenience which may be suffered, by the subsequent suspension of specie payments by the Girard Bank, in October following, should be borne by the holder of the Bonds, who failed to call on the day for the amount due. Without undertaking to decide give an opinion as to the correctness of the insuing presented by the President of the Union Bank, I am informed by him, that he has addressed you on the subject, and that he has also addressed the agent of the Bonds at Philadelphia with a view to make a proper arrangement [unclear] and I have every reason to believe, from what what he informs me, that the payment will be made at an early day _ Should the arrangement made by the Union Bank close alluded to fail to accomplish the object I will together If it should not be paid by the Bank upon being infor
