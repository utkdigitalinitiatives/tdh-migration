Washington March 6 1850 Dear Sir. Herewith I enclose you some of the most recent Testimonials, presented to the Military Committee of Congress in favor of Colts Repeating Pistols, I enclose also the forms of requisition necessary to procure the quota of arms due the State of Tennessee under the law of 1808 making appropriations for arming the militia of the United States _ Believing that a supply of these pistols would be much desired & Knowing that the quantity under the control of the Government is quite small, & which may soon be exhausted by requisitions from other States. I have had prepared & here enclose the necessary forms to obtain them. If you concur with me is this opinion, please have these papers filled up & returned to me & I will at once place them before the Department. I presume it will make no difference that you may have previously made requisition for the ordinary arms. if you should see proper to charge it in whole or part for these pistols. I have the honor to be very truly your obt sert obedient servant James H Thomas His Ex. Excellency Wm William Trousdale Governor &c etcetera
