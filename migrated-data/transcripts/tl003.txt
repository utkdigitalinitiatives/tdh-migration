Knoxville 9th June 1803 Sir The road passing through the Anderson County from Nashville to Natchez has for some time past been infested with a gang of Banditts Bandits , whether White men or Indians or both, has not been fully ascertained. I enclose a copy of a Letter from General Winchester on that subject. Not long before the transaction mentioned by him three of the Citizens of this state were returning from Natchez they were fired on, and one of the party ( Reuben White ) killed, the others made their escape, they were pursued several miles by three persons one of whom they supposed to be a white man and the other two Indians. I am aware of the difficulty of devising any effectual plan to ensure the safety of travellers on that road, or to discover and apprehend the perpetrators of such crimes Perhaps a few men stationed at different some houses of entertainment and a few posts established on the road (say at the unc Duck and Tennessee rivers) might have a good effect on deterring and a reward offered might

induce some of the Indians to use their efforts under the direction of the Agents to apprehend the offenders, or such other measures as the President may think proper to direct. I wish to hear from you on this subject as soon as Convenient. If Similar cases should occur and it should appear that the offenders belong to any tribe of Indians I doubt whether the frontier citizens would wait for the Orders of Government while their minds are so much an of so Justly irritated Every thing Everything in my power will be done to make a discovery of the perpetrators of the Murders and Robberies and also to preserve that peace friends with the Indians which is so necessary to our prosperity and I am Sir with great respect unc Your Most Obd Obedient Servant Archibald Roane Henry Dearborne Esq Esquire Secretary at War
