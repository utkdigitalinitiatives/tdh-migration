Bayou Robert 22nd February 1836 Dear Cousin Your esteemed favor of the 19th ult. ultimo Came to hand yesterday was much pleased to hear of the good health of you family, & friends generally. I wrote you a few days since and should not have written again so soon but you regret on paper so much your neglect in writing that I thought I would try you again. You found us all in fine health & spirits, having just received intelligence that the Parley Parlez Vous had paid the first instalment installment on the indemnity due some of our Citizens that they have tried & failed to swindle old Hickory out of, but when they found the old fellow had raised his bristles and gritted his gums they crouched and did as they were bid, in consequence of which Cotton has taken a little rise now from 13 c cents to 18c and brisk , mine is all sold except 42 bales my crop will neat net me $13,000 two or three hundred, I am planting a little more land this year in Cotton & hope to make a better crop, should it so happen that I cant visit you this spring which is uncertain, and the prospects of my crop good the latter part of Augt. August it is probable that I shall thus see you, as in that event I shall want a few hands particularly should

negroes fall of which I fear there is little hope I wish you to comply with the request made in my former letter writing me frequently the price of them; I may still be in Tenn. Tennessee this spring but it is uncertain I have two or three objects in view which I should be obliged to abandon if I come. I heard yesterday that our troops had the Florida indians so hemed hemmed up there was no chance of their escape and had more volunteers than was required to conquer them I hope the whole tribe will be exterminated. Thomas & John Butler are both well and both doing extremely well, John has a fine piece of land & we calculate to assist him in getting some hands the next fall, Thomas has no land yet but has nine or ten first rate hands and receives a full share for them in uncles crop this year, they will both be rich in a few years should no adverse fortune befal befall them they are young men entitled to great credit for their attention & industry. Tell cousin "Patsy" Col Colonel Kings wife since the stars have stoped stopped falling she has got to dancing again she has learned to pray I suppose to be ready in case it occurs again, the spark of fire made some of them dance Juba (oh I wish I did know how to pray) and you could not
