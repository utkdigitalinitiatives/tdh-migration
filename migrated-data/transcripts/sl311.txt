Dresden Tennessee April 14th 1846 My Dear sir, having some leisure moments, I have concluded to dedicate them to you, to see if I can drive off the 'blues' and collect an idea worthy the perusal of one for whom I most certainly entertain the highest regard But the question is, what shall I write? Politics, they have become stale Shall I speak of Oregon , the "Eden of the West" why with its history you are as familiar as myself _ Soon shall the Brittish British join Lion Crouch and yield to the American Eagle with its stars and stripes Shall I speak of Mr. Polk , I should only breathe what is wafted on every breeze _ ? , undoubtedly, is the most popular president we have ever had and that too deservedly so, every act of his administration has been marked with the most devoted and truly american principles _ Owing his elevation to any no particular portion of the democratic party in the Country, he may be truly termed the "peoples president" and the voice of the nation is A nations gratitude is sung To thee our standard bearer, young Though thou art, around they standard freemen press And all thy acts approve and bless Thy public acts we've closely scanned _ We find them just, in wisdom planned. you must pardon my attempt in verse, but he deserves all praise â€” And his entire course meets my warmest approbation

But of what, and upon what subject shall I write _ should gay spring, with her mantle of green was here, I should be far behind the birds, for weeks you have heard them chant of a winter gone Should I speak of the face of the country, you have seen that for yourself Should I tell you I was happy, you would ask me to Examine my heart _ . Should I say that I am unhappy, you _would say it would be unnatural to be otherwise Well I will tell you one thing, if I am miserable, the world shall never know it _ I may weep though the tears I will hide, When I think of the hour we parted, Bow meekly, and tamely abide The fiat one that is false-hearted. By heavens here goes a calvacade cavalcade of Mormons, on their way to california , poor deluded wretch creatures, I pity them from my heart _ It seems that they labour labor under some strange hallucination of mind, to quit, country 'kith and kin' to follow a few designing impostures imposters _ May the Great architect shield and preserve them and may they yet be enlightened _ My health is good and hope these may find you and yours in the enjoyment of health and happiness My prospects in life are good so far as a living is concerned, of my troubles you have heard me speak This very unintelligible letter is intended to spur a regular correspondance correspondence should you deem it worthy by which I hope to receive many ? to soothe a troubled heart Hoping soon to hear from you I remain your friend MD Cardwell A Adam Fergusson Esqr Esquire
