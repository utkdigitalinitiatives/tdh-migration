United States Military Academy West Point Dec December 8th 1835 Dear John I have received your letters of the 9th & 14th of Nov November and have not had time to answer them until now. I need not tell you I am very busy as now is the most I important time in my course and I have very little time to write and I hope you will excuse me on that account. Dear Brother I will not ask any more questions of Sister Mary or any body else to know how I am to get away from here for I know one already and will trouble you or myself any more about it so be easy on that Point. Dear Brother — I need no inducement to stay here for I would not go for the world and I was very angry that you said you would send Alex to Yale Colege College as an inducement for me to stay here so I your humble servent servant would be much ablige oblige to you if you would never name such a thing again. Give my respects to Mr & Mrs Lorance and tell Mr Lorance I am much ablige to him for his

good wishes more particularly considering my peculiar situation and the time and the place I am at. Dear Brother you see I am willing to stay here for this reason. Sending you the regulations and even uncle Jackson is in my favour favor but still my Brother John cannot be satisfied when I do w not write like I was a Methodist Parson, and if you my Dear Brother cannot put up with my dull, complaining style as you call it (which I do not intend). I cannot with yours for shame. A young man who is just going to join himself in wedlock with an amiable & handsome young lady to complain of his Brother who is at a distance from home who wishes to make a little fun and who you take for a dull, complaining style you must not be so suspitious suspicious and more so to me in my situation . now I will tell you we have no amusements or pleasures but studying & as the snow and ice covers the ground, the Ice on the ponds is about three inches thick, and it is a little amusement on Saturday Evenings but I do not go for this reason it is the only day I have to write unless I encro ⁁ ch encroach on my studies & you ask whether I corespond correspond with uncle. I do.

Dear Brother you are too severe on me come give me some thing better and do not depress my spirits so you do more to make me dislike this place than any thing else by your long and uninteresting letters filled with advice I cannot some times understand I always feel like all was not going as well as it might. I feel as I have done something wrong, said some thing very wounding to your feelings, or said some thing I ought not to , some thing I would not to have done for the world. Oh John do not write so any more if you can help it for my sake and feelings at this moment I feel my heart as is it was ready to burst after reading your last letter. Do save my feelings by writing no more such letters, tell me at once what I have said incorect incorrect , for I am now feel as if I could go where no human face could see me do leave of writing any mo more such Letters Give my love to all my relations and accepts of the same from your Brother Andrew
