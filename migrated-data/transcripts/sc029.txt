Beans Station, Grainger Co County Tn Tennessee April 10th 1846 To the Board of Managers of the A, B, Society Dear brothers and friends After spending a few days with my family, I left home on the 20th ult for Mossy Creek , which place I reachd reached on Saturday time enough to preach at 12 O'clock there being a sacramental meeting there. at that place. It is in a good neighbourhood neighborhood , bounded on the South, by Bays Mountain and on the North by poor ridges. On the Sabbath I addressed the people on the great subject of my agency After I had closed, Dr Rev Reverend added some well timed remarks. We obtained a pledge of $ 17. collected some frinds friends , and organised organized the Mossy Creek Bible Society. The frinds friends collected were left with the Treasurer until he could obtain more. I think the Society will gradually increase and do much good. From that neighbourhood I went to Beans Station , via Rutledge, where I spent two days, preached on Saturday and Sabbath I formed a small Bible Society containing some about fifty members, some fifteen of whom are coloured colored people, who take a deep interest in the cause, paying $3.00 of what was collected. This Society is surrounded by a vast range of partial distibution distribution O , May it be as a Light in a dark place"! March 30.th I went across the country some twenty miles near to the Mouth of Chucky at Beth Carr M. ?. There being held a protracted meeting there, at which I remained until Wednesday. I there formed the Beth Carr Bible Society, ? collected for it $8.23. and obtained aditional additional pledges, most of which will be, if they have not already been paid. This Society is designed to supply with Bibles Testerments Testaments a poor destitute section which lies between the Chucky and French Broad rivers , north of the Paint Mountain . They have a great work to perform; with small means. I have situated places for these Small Societies where they could do much, as distributors "of other man's bounties" I think it is better to have small societies than Bible Committies Committees . My views on this subject have been previously given with ??riess. Wednesday evening, April 1st I crossed the Chucky French Broad to Newport . The Society

2, There had been urged until it had collected and sent on some $40. for books, which are daily expected. From Newport I passed up the French Broad, via Warm Springs , c et cetera to Asheville N.C. where I spent the Sabbath and two following days. In Oct 1844 . The Holston Conference held its session within seven miles of Ashville Asheville . Bishop Jones was there and a fresh impulse was given to the Bible Cause. Rev-ern Langdon ; Agent of the A N.e. Bible Society was in attendance, and obtained some cash, and pledges from sundry persons to take in all, about 800 Bibles. Its been some 8 months before these Bibles came in, three fourths of the subscribers negle refused or neglected as they have still done to take them. Learning the state of things there and believing the cause was suffering, I went up delivered an address on the subject formed or ? organised organized a Bible Society collected $42.00 and made arrangements to have the Bibles distributed myself taking away one hundred Bibles of them. It is of great importance to an agent to be personally accquainted acquainted with the leading citizens of a country. By this means I seceeded succeeded in obtaining such assistance as I trust, will ere long supply that mountain country with the word of God. Wednesday, April 8th I passed 20 miles down the French Broad on the 9th , I crossed the Paint Mountain into Green Greene Co County Tn Tennessee I sent 30 Bibles to the Beth Carr B. Bible Society and left with a pious lady Mrs Nelson near the Warm Springs , 20 Bibles for distribution among the destitute in the mountains, South of the Warm Springs. The Methodists and Baptists have small Societies out there. I also left ten Bibles with a pious lady, Miss Eliza Jane Coutter , fifteen miles South of Greenville Greeneville , near Paint Mountain. I have heard of many some affecting cases of destitution, but deem it unnecessary to relate them, unless they were uncommonly touching . I then passed through Greenville Greeneville in which place I am hereafter to make a special effort, via Rhea Towers , to Jonesboro , to meet a Sabbath appointment of 3 weeks standing. It was a rainy time on Sabbath, we collected a respectable congregations however, at 12 O'clock, in the Presbyterian Church, and organised reorganized or organised reorganized a Bible Society which I presume has been officially reported. The cash pledged and paid down was some $50.00 which will be doubled soon, I hope, as the

3 friends from the country, who will hereafter unite in the common cause, were kept away by the rain. The funds collected were left with the Treasurer, as he expects soon to be in New York . At early candle lighting we met in the Methodist Church and organised the Washington Co County Juvenile Bible Society, Auxiliary c et cetera collecting $20. This Society intends to supply the County Sunday Schools with Testaments. I believe it will do well. Monday 13th I drove to Blountville, Sullivan Co County and finished the organization of a Society previously convened there. I collecd collected of the Treasurer $38.86 over what had been paid for carriage on the 3 boxes. The people in that place are waking up to the subject, and before the close of the year, they will probably dispose of nearly a thousand Bibles, and more than that number of Testaments increasing your funds some $500.00 From Blountville I went to Scott County Va. Virginia taking with me an aditional additional supply of one hundred and thirteen Bibles and Testaments. I made arrangements to have most of these sold in Scott and Lee Counties, by several responsible individuals, who will cheerfully serve the good cause without charge From these parts I returned and passed through Kingsport , and was glad to find that the Society there had received their books and were doing well. I came on through Rogersville , also , where I shall make a spiral effort, in due time. I had an appointment at this place on Friday evening, which I attended to, The Society which I found here 3 weeks ago is doing well, for a small place I have now closed my monthly report The prospects are brightening. I am satisfied I have never been engaged in so great a work O may I be enabled to advance it more effectually! Yours truly Thos. Thomas Springfield Inclosed is my account
