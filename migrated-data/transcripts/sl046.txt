Private Washington Decbr December 31st 1836 My dear sir, Mr. Adam Huntsman , three days past, placed in my hands your letter to him on the subject of the resignation of the postmaster at Jackson on yesterday Doctor Butlers letter reached here informing that the postmaster, Mr Talbot has resigned — I sent for the postmaster Genl General had an interview with him on the subject, and in due time you will receive the appointment. I have just heard the distressing intelligence that Emily Donelson is no more — I feel for poor Major Donelson — he left me on the night of the 3rd, instant & I suppose got home six days before her death — I have not heard from him since he got home — I suppose his mind has been so much destroyed that he could not write — he has all my sympathies, but this

does no good — time alone can heal the wound, but the loss to his dear little children never can be repaired. I have had a severe attack of hemorhage hemorrhage — I lost, says the Doctor, upwards of 70 oz ounces blood in less than 48 hours — I am improving slowly and trust in a kind Providence that he will prolong my days untill until I once more reach the Hermitage . When Major Donelson left me he he put in my possession the enclosed letter enclosed to him to deliver you here — finding that you will not be here, I send it to you. Give my kind regards to your Elisabeth & children, and to Dr Doctor Butler & Patsy — to Rachel Butler & daughter — to Samuel J. Hays & Francis , & to Narsissa — and to all our connection and believe me your friend Andrew Jackson Robert J. Chester Esqr Esquire —
