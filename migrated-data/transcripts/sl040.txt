County of Washington Febry February 20th 1825 Dear Sir The public Journals will have given you the result of the presidential election, and how it was brought about by the Union of Clay and his friends with Mr Adams — The predictions in past have been fulfilled, Mr Clay, it is said, has been offered the office of Sec Secretary of State, and it is also said he has agreed to accept it. This to my mind is the most open daring corruption that has ever shewn itself under our government, and if not checked by the people, will lead to open direct bribery in less than twenty years— for what is this barter of office for votes but bribery— Mr Clay is prostrate here in the minds of all honest & honourable honorable men— What will be his fate in Kentucky I cannot say, but Mr Bibb who is here, says this act will promote him in Kentucky. I recd received your letter and disposed of it as you had directed, I regret I had not it in my power to serve you, it will give me pleasure when occasion occurs. I can do nothing with your claim, had Mr Dercker sent on his deposition I have no doubt but I could have got the account settled; I could have obtained a refference reference to the atto. genl. attorney on had your statement or memorial have & been deposed to, I could have obtained a refference reference and the atto. genls attorney generals opinion, as it is, I will bring on

your letter & memorial, and you can have them changed, and transmitted in the recess, and have the opinion of the atto genl attorney general on it. Mrs. J. has been unwell for about 3 weeks She is recovering, and I hope will be able to travel so soon as the senate can rise. I cannot leave it untill until it rises, for in the virtue of the Senate I have great hopes will prevent the consecration of those corrupt bargains for office. Mrs. J. joins me in respects to you, your amiable daughter & family & believe me sincerely your friend Andrew Jackson
