Cairo 25th August 1817 Sir your favor of the 7th instant came to hand by the last western mail to this place, given me the result of a council of the chickasaw nation on the subject on the line I have lately run It is not true that I surved surveyed and laid off a Town at the chickasaw Bluff before the line was run, but it is true that I was present when a town was laid off and surveyed at that place How this circumstance is supposed to have any effect on the runing running the line alluded to I cannot concieve conceive , with relation to due notice agreeably to the treaty, you know the first notice was made to depend upon the the the time of holding a treaty for the salt springs on Sandy; which was to have been held the last of may or first June , and time enough was previously given to the best of my recollection at least a month, the treaty was not held it is true, but it was only known about that time that time that it would not be held, and then to

to obviate all possible misunderstandings on the subject, I personally attended in the nation, when you was good enough to meet me at Mr Allison and when & where you heard me ask major James Colbert when at what time the chiefs design to see the line run, could meet on the bank of Tennessee river at the place of beginning, and that he finally fixed on the first monday in June being the 7th day of June ; did not all the amount to due and seasonable notice; I made arrangements to commence the line accordingly but waited for the chiefs untill until thursday the 10th when hearing nothing of them and perceiving too if I delayed any longer that I should have to send to the settlement, near 100 miles, for an additional supply of provisions. under these circumstance I commenced the line, and on saturday the 12th when we had not progressed more than six miles, major James Colbert joined us. and told me the chief was sick or they would have met me according to appointment or words to that effect, I then reported to him when and where I had commenced the line how far I had progressed &c etcetera with all of which he

appeared to be satisfied and we progressed with harmony and friendship on monday the 14th of June when we had progress 16 miles Captain Seely the other chief joined, I reported to him as I had done to major Colbert he expressed no dissatisfaction, but went on very chearfully cheerfully except some times of an afternoon he complained that the compass run too far from the seting sun The instruments I used were the best which could be had in this country, and I believe they are equal in correctness to any in the united states, If it was true that the line was not taken up untill 8 or 9 oclock in the morning I cannot see how its correctness could be effected by it, But the reverse is the fact, I never saw more persevering mastery in private or public service than was exhibited in this occasion, the whole party rose soon after daylight breakfast was cooked and eat and the line take between 6 or 7 oclock and continued untill ut one oclock when dinner was prepared and sent to him and the party on the line, about one hour was given for dinner when the line was again taken up and continued untill continued untill continued untill about sundown not blazing the trees too according to eaty so made a subject of complaint I hazard nothing in saying that the line is better is better marked than any line I ever saw in the united states and that the trees on each side of the line are marked bold according to the treaty, You are at liberty to read this letter to the chiefs of you place I am very respectfully Sir Your most obedient servant J James Winchester Col Colonel H Sherburne agent chickasaw nation Copy of a letter to Col Shereburne Agent Chickasaw nation
