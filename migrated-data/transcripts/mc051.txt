Knoxville Tennessee Feb. February 13th 1838 Dear Brother, Through the politeness of Col. Colonel Ramsey I have just received your letter of the 11th, inst instant , which I now proceed in haste to answer. I was truly gratified to hear something from yourself, sister Catharine and the rest of the family, as they are sources from which I have been anxiously expecting to hear for some time past. Since your letter Came to hand I have made considerable enquiry among the mirchants merchants of this place in order to learn when they intend going to the east for their goods Many of them have already gone, Viz Messrs. Jackson , Dickenson , Armstrong and Gaines ; and I can hear of no one else who intends going on before about the middle of March. Mr. G. M. Hayen will leave here about that time; but as he will be in Considerable haste I expect he will take the stage from this place. In fact I have heard of no one going any other way as they all wish to perform the trip as soon as possible. We have no news here that is worth

writeing writing . There will be Circuit Court in this place dureing during this week and next; and we have a very disagreeable time for it, for our streets are so made that they are almost impassible Albert is very industrious and progresses well. I scarcely find him at any other place except in his room or at school. His teacher has a very high opinion of him. I could not be better pleased with any situation than my own. The family with whom I board is a very agreeable and respectible respectable one; and it is in a retired part of town where I have no interruption at all In addition to this Judge Scott takes great pleasure in giveing giving me instruction and I am convinced he has paid more attention to me than is generally given to law students. He says I am getting along quite well and indeed has given me considerable encouragement. Albert and myself are well I conclude here because I have nothing more to write. You will excuse the hand write as I am in great haste. Give our love to each and every one of the family And acknowledge for yourself the esteem of your most affectionate brother James M. Monroe Welcker To Mr. Henry I. Inman Welcker
