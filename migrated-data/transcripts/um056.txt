College Hill , Hanover Feb February 23d 1849 My own dear Katie With much joy, your, long, kind, and interesting epistle was received a few days ago. I had almost given up in despair, thinking that you were so much engaged with your old Friends, and enjoying yourself so well, that you never gave a passing thought to "Ben", but how agreeably was he surprised, when that welcome word yes! greeted his ears and a letter was handed out, with the welcome, and well known direction. As you state in your letter where you were when you wrote, I will tell you where I am, conversing, as you say, by means of pen, ink and paper with a loved one, far distant. I am sitting, at my little desk, in "Sky Parlor" not alone, as the other boys are making plenty of noise, but I manage to write some way. It is Friday night, we have been down to the river to see some of the students off, tell Ed Edward Pat Walker is off for good. We all being somewhat fatigued, concluded not to go to society. It is quite muddy, and it has been debated with some spirit, whether there was any " Terra Firma" in, or about Hanover, except on a large rock. You ask me if it is not to good to think of, to converse face to face. I answer it is, for me. Yet my imagination will often take wings and fly to the land of the "Sunny South", and there rest amid the memories of many happy scenes past, and gone. And in my dreams, do I revisit "home" and see my friends, and am happy. But the visions of night are false, and I awake to find my self in Hanover. I have two homes , one where my Father is, the other where my Mother is. I feel very thankful to you all for being so kind as to let me come home, the session is out just 5 weeks from yesterday. I have a Valedictory to deliver before our Society, and I just commenced it. I am very hard pressed for time, I have little, very little time I can call my own. You speak of your

Sewing Society. I consider myself a member of that honerable honorable body, if it is the old society, as I gave them, 25, half the initian initiation fee. I will pay the rest, when I have the pleasure of walking in after supper, and spending a few happy moments with the, handsome, lovely, and fair daughters of Memphis . But I am afraid I shall feel lost in thier their company, as I have been in thier their company, that is of young Ladies, So few times scince since I left Memphis. And if I am somewhat awkard awkward , you all will know the reason. I have not been over to see Miss Anna , to tell her I had recieved received a letter from you, but I must go tomorrow. Mr Nelson is quite sick. The Young Ladies of this place say I am in love with a Miss Katie Woodard , because I said she was the handsomest girl in town. On account of that I cannot succeed with any of them. They do not make much as I care for none of them, and there is no love lost, on either side. A few days ago, we all went up to Madison to see Old Tuck and I saw the old Hero. I will give you the particulars when I get home. I recieved received a letter from Cy Clapp a few days ago. He spent his Christmas vacation at B — They were all well. He is in fine spirits, and wants to get married, which is more than I want to do. You ask me why I did not send that ring to you by Ed Edward or Bunyan . I will tell you truth. I hated to part with it. I was on the point of giving it up, several times, but I could not let it go. It has not been off my finger scince since I left M — Memphis nor shall it until I am there. I do not know whether you will have to let the folks see this or not, but I would rather you would read it to them. I am sorry Bunyan has left M — Memphis . As I expect to see you soon, I will defer saying anything on that subject, I suppose you know what I mean. They have just sent up a bucket of Apples and we are feasting. And by the way we have had quite a renovation in affairs at our

house. One of Judge Dunns , Sons, with his wife have taken the reins of government. The way we are now is a caution. We have the best table in town. We put our own sugar, and cream (and it is cream) in our coffee, have two kinds of pies and everything in style, dining room carpeted &c et cetera it will be no use for me to go on and enumerate, the many improvements that have been made during the past week. Mrs Tillon is up here now. She enquired about you yesterday. The Boys here say, or rather remarking, that they do dislike to get with a Young Lady who says only Yessir! No Sir! So do I. I have been unwell a little lately but have nevertheless tended recitations. I caught a bad cold, for I never caught a good one, and it settled in my head. I attend singing school every Thursday evening for a hour. Rev Reverend Crowe is teacher. The young Ladies attend, that is if any of the young men go with them, none of them get there by my help. Tell Ed. Edward , that Kalfus is setting up to Miss Tuba like 40 You must have had some very fine times at the Donation Party, as you was mistress of ceremonies. I gave some of the particulars to some of our good Abolitionists. They were somewhat surprised. That was quite an adventure which you relate. Did not the poor young man faint? I fear he would have hurt himself, if you had pushed him over the Falls. I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing the Chap sometime, I just wish to see how he looks. You ought to have given me a description of him. I hope my Friends Miss H & R Miller are prospering finely. I think a heape heap of them. My love to them. And I might as well give my love, here, to all the young Ladies, but, as I have not time to write thier their names, please give my love to all that I am acquainted with, tell them I have the same respect and warm friendship, and Love for them as ever. All your Friends are well. The occupants of this room wish to be remembered to you.

The Boys are talking, who they are going to take to decoration. I shall none. I cannot have so much enjoyment with anyone, as I had with Mary last Decoration. I suppose you remember some of the things that happened that day, and the days following. Aunt Fanny sends her love to Mamny . She can manage to get in the door, hard work though. We all were glad to heare hear that Mr Rhea had reached M — Memphis in safety. I am getting some what sleepy, and must say, "Good night" with happy dreams. Saturday morning. This morning dawned cloudy, and now it is raining. Oh the mud, somewhat similar to the "Plough of Despond". I visit the point and the Falls now and then. I always think of you. I am in hopes to climb about those Falls with you, sometime again. I have been waiting very anxiously, for an answer to my letter to Ed Edward , he must be very busy. If he dont write I will give him a "Hooshier Breeze". I shall expect an answer to this, you must write soon so that it will get here before I leave. I recieved received that Visitor, and it was a welcome Visitor. It is mail day, and I am in hopes to get something from some of my corespondents correspondents . I expect Mr Frierson and Davis will go down with me. We will have a very pleasant trip. Nothing of importance has happened in the peaceful village of H — Hanover lately. Every thing goes on quite smoothly. I believe I have written all I can raise. My Love the Young Ladies at "Walnut Hills" . My Love to all at Home. Take my hat full of Love for yourself. Do all you can for the Lord, among your associates. Write soon! Write soon! to Your Uncle Ben College Hill To Miss Mary C. Porter Memphis Tenn. Tennessee
