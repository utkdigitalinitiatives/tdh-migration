E. Ten. East Tennessee College Sunday evening June 19th 36 Dear father. Your letter of the 13th inst. instant containing two letters, and two five Dollar bills has been more than welcomely recd received .- On yesterday morning I left for Clinton ; and William's land was bid off to me as your agent for the twenty six Dollars & 6 ¼._ I then increased the bid by laying your claim upon it ; so that if any other individual should redeem the land within two years, he will be compelled to refund the amount at which the land was bid off, and to satisfy your claim._ In the division of the land it was agreed that William's lot should pay to another one 20 dollars; and this will have to be done by you to Richard Olivar ._ The whole cost of the land will consequently be forty six dollars & 6 ¼._ The Sheriff was unable to make a deed, because the land had not been surveyed._ But Major Jarnagin Clerk of Circuit Court at Clinton will receive it when made and convey it to Knoxville .- Galbreath is tending the land in corn as a renter; and whoever holds the land is entitled to the rent._ One of the Mr Butlers was willing to give a hundred dollars for your interest in the land; but this offer was not accepted on in as much as it was not eaqual equal the sum of the amount at which the land was bid off, the cost attending it and your claim; _ all of which would have been the rise of $120._ Those best acquainted with this division of the tract represent

it to be worth $250; and it is highly probable that Eskridge will redeem it in order to secure something for his own claims._ And let the matter now end as it can you will certainly receive the amount of your debt.- If I had not attended the sale, your proportional part of the amount of land brought after deducting cost would have been only between two and three dollars; so it may be considered fortunate that I went._ Having paid out 26 dollars towards the land, and expended about five dollars for books, which could not be procured from the library, in consequence of their having been taken out the first week before we arrived, we shall need a least thirty dollars more._ It is now time for me to commence my lesson, and as I am in possion possession of no news of a special nature I beg leave to close this hasty scroll by requesting you to give my respects to the family and requesting to recieve the same for yourself._ F. Frederick A Welcker To Henry Welcker
