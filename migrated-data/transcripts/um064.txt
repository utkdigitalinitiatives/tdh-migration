Columbia Female Institute December 20th 1840 My dear Mama & Papa. As it is Sunday and as the weather is too disagreeable for us to go to church. I think that I could not find a more pleasant than writing to my dear Mama & Papa. I know that you will think that it is not right for me to write on Sunday, but I want my letter to arrive there on Christmas day. You have no idea how much pleasure it would give me to receive one on that day. This letter I know will not find Papa at home. but I have not written to him for so long a time. that I am afraid that he will not like it. I have commenced looking for Papa up to see me. I wish that he would make haste and come. I am so very impatient to see him. Mama how do you intend spending your Christmas? I know that you will all be so happy. I do wish that I was at home. If I was I should be the happiest creature living. By ‚ÅÅ the next Christmas I expect I shall be at our happy home.

Kiss the children. I remain your ever affectionate Daughter Mary Jane Chester Col. Robt. Colonel Robert J. & Elizabeth Chester P.S. Post Script O Oh ! I forgot to say Christmas Gift .
