Columbia Female Institute March 28th 1841 My dear Father As this is the day that we have to write Compositions and perhaps is the only time that I shall have to write for one or two week. I have concluded to write to you my dear Father I have no news to tell you so you must be satisfied with a very short & uninteresting letter. I was very much grieved to hear that Mama was so sick when you arrived at home but I hope by this time that she is perfectly recovered — If she is it would give me so much pleasure to receive a letter from her — Papa you cannot imagine how much pleasure your visit gave ⁁ me but I wish to see almost as much as I did before you came, I wish that you all would live in Columbia, how until I finish my Education, I know that it is a very selfish wish but you know it is impossible for human nature to be without some portion of selfishness. I was very much pleased to hear that Aunt Patsey has recovered her health. I expect that her sickness was occasioned by Uncle Will's absence but now that the time is so fast approaching for him to return she will get well I can assure you then. As soon as Uncle returns I want him to write me a long letter for he has never written me one line since I been away from home but I can can can excuse that as he has not been at ho me When he returns I must have a letter from him. Aunt Walker has had a very severe spell since — O she has suffered so much, they were all very uneasy about her, but they think that she is something better this morning. I have not been there since you left Columbia, for Mr Smith is so very strict about us leaving the Institute. I suppose that you have received the third Number of the Guardian. there is an account of every thing respecting Miss Julia Gordon . Some of her own writings Papa you cannot imagine how much she was beloved by all her class mates. Tell Cousin Dick that he must answer my letter soon. Tell Jack Hays that I should like to receive a letter. I suppose that Mary Ormand can almost write a letter. My love to Cousin Martha Ann Cousin Will & their children

March 28th 1841 My dearest Mama I avail myself of Papa blank paper to say a few words to you. Do forgive me for my long silence for and feel that I ought not to have delayed so long in writing to you, but my dear Mama to tell you the truth I have had nothing at all to write that would interest you in the least. Cousin Ophelia Hays sent for Miss Bills , Kate Bowen , & myself to go out there & remain until Saturay Saturday evening, and when we asked permission to go Mr F. G. Smith said that we must be at home (My home now the Institute) by Sunset. We were determined that we would not break his rules. so we got home just in time, so we were sitting out in the Front Porch when here comes Mr Smith (bowing all the time) Why young ladies it is more than I expected, I said Mr — You must have a very had opinion of us No indeed but I thought perhaps that you might be tempted to break the rules. Nevertheless the Western District stands very very high in my estimation. Mama you must not think that I am trying to praise myself but just to think of Mr S — Smith being so deceitful. I do not like so much as I use to. I told Papa when he was here that I was not going to take lessons in Music from Mrs Smith any but I am very happy to inform him & you that the new teacher has left the Institute & I still continue to take lessons from Mrs Smith. I am very much pleased with her mode of teaching. Mama how does the Parlour Parlor look without the Piano. I am glad that it is gone, but still I cannot help from feeling sorry. The Rose bush that you sent me is growing very prettily. I was very much pleased with all the things that you sent me. I wish that I was at home to see some of your beautiful flowers— I know that every thing looks so pretty. Is aunt Narcissa as fond of her Garden as ever. I can imagine that I see her & Mary Ormand in the Garden together. Give my most sincere love to all my relations and Friends. Your ever affectionate & confiding daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester

My dear brother John You must excuse me for writing on Mama's and Papa's paper but indeed it is the only sheet of paper that I have ⁁ in my Port-folio portfolio , and I have concluded that you have determined not to write to me until I write to you. I am sure that you are not aware how much pleasure it gives me to receive letters from you, or you would write to me every Saturday . brother John do you attend as many parties as you did before I left home. I hope you enjoy youself yourself very much. Have you seen Miss Ann Eliza Lancaster lately. You know that she once upon a time was your sweet hearts . I suppose that you have had the honour honor of seein seeing Miss Lyon . do you think her handsome. O! I was so much delighted to hear that Brother Sam could ⁁ walk — how I should like to see him strutting about I know that he looks so sweet & pretty — My love to all. Your afft affectionate Sister M. J. C. Mary Jane Chester Mr John Chester
