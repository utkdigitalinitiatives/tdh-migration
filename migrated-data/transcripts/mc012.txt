Memphis Sunday Oct. October 21st 1835. My Dear little wife I recd received your letter of the 17th , also the enclosed certificate of Mr Hull . I am glad to hear daily by telegraph that you are well and trust you will continue so. I am as usual in good health notwithstanding there is so much throughout Memphis. The fever has taken many, and in some families not a single member has been left. None of your particular acquaintances have died that I remember of. The number of deaths last week and the week before are the same though there has been a considerable abatement in the disease in the last 3 days. The indications are that in a very short time the fever will entirely disappear and the many Citizens that fled will soon return. Mr. Montomery left yesterday for Huntsville to close our business there if possible. At least it will be his last trip upon that business & will determine whether we will construct the Huntsville line or not.

Mrs Williamson is in delicate health — have not seen her out of her room since I returned. Mrs Dill as usual, the rest well — D. Watson is trying to get a room at Mrs Rutherfords for his family. They will have to take a room in the 3rd story or the one we occupied, as Mrs. W. Williamson will continue in hers. I will send the silk for Mary Ann , the first opportunity that offers. I am glad to hear you are releived relieved of your troublesome birth, that it is all over now. Take good care of the rest as you have good reason to value and be proud of them.

I advised him honor for his intended's sake to leave as soon as possible or the the yellow fever would claim him, & leave her a beautiful betrothed widow and perhaps a Mrs —, Somebody — He couldn't stand that of cours course and was off in the ears instanter . I have no news to write you. the city is dull, but will soon be shining again — Good bye. Tell Mary Pa wants to see her so bad. & Ma & baby and all. My love to all. Ask Puss when that event comes on. Your Affectionate James —
