Nashville Dec December 16. 1840 Dear Sir Your letter of the 14th is at hand, per politeness of Mr. Stephens I thank you for the interest you express in extending the circulation of the Union. I can only say that so long as I can wag my pen I shall be untiring in my efforts to give forth true information and sound republican doctrine through the columns of my paper__striving to advise the people of the course and conduct of the associated factions that have by pipelaying and money succeeded in a temperary temporary overthrow of the old Republican party. They must and will quarrel among themselves__ and expire from spontaneous conbustion combustion as did old Mrs. Frithful Already Clay & Webster are falling out. Meantime let us take advantage of their difficulties and organise organize thoroughly for action next August. Let every precinct be organised, so that the committees of may cause documents and papers to be people's houses, and Know exactly how many can be cast on the day of election. If we re-elect Gov. Govenor Polk __ if we do not work thro we may be defeated. We are organised in in Maury ; and the good

Post Office The rules of the P. O. Dept Department allow Post Masters to send money &c and etcetera in letters to editors for papers, free of postage when the letters are written by the P. M. Post Master himself — so no expense need be encurred incurred by transmission I shall be ready to make and reasonable allowance in the way of commissions for subscribers obtained.
