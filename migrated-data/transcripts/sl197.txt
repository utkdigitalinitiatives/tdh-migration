Columbia Decr December 15. 1830. Dear Sir: Mr. Wm. L. Willeford is an applicant for the office of Surveyor General for the states of Mississippi and Louisiana , and justly appreciating your weight of character as well with the Executive as the public is very solicitous to procure your influence in his behalf. I have informed him that it was not your custom to interfere in matters of this kind, and that if you would consent to recommend any man, you would be guided alone by the safe and correct principle of recommending no man for an office, on whom you would not bestow it, were you vested with the appointed power. Acting on the same principle, I will speak of him to you, as I would to the President, were I addressing him, and as I would have you speak of him, should your kindness prompt you and your judgement (a safer guide for all our actions) approve of your interfering in his favour favor . I know that my opinion of Mr. Willeford would insure ⁁ him but small consideration, but yet I hope, I may be excused for repeating what the public opinion has

pronounced of him especially to my greatest benefactor. To Mr. Willeford I am indebted for much of the small stock of learning, of which I am master, as to yourself I am for most of the reputation I enjoy in society. Mr W Willeford — is a deeply skilled, scientific and distinguished mathematician, as is evinced both by the unanimous consent of the community, and the various employments, he has discharged with honour honor to himself and utility to the public. He is not only well versed in the theory but skilled in the practice of surveying, having done much of that business in sectioning the public lands in Alabama . He is a gentlemen, an honest man, industrious, plain, practical, sober, and no doubt well calculated to discharge the duties of the office, he seeks. No man can be more persevering or more accurate, and in my opinion, take him all in all, there are few men, who at the same time unite so much merit and so many qualifications, for this office. After what I have said I need scarcely add how much I shall be gratified, should you feel it consistent with your rules of conduct to aid in forwarding his wishes. Present me respectfully to Mrs Overton , and allow me ⁁ to offer my prayers to the throne of mercy, that your useful life may be long preserved to your counting, your virtues initiated by the public and your friendship
