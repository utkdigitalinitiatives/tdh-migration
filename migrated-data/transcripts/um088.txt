Columbia Tennessee March 28th 1843 My dear Father, Indeed I scarcely know what excuse to plead, for my delay in answering your very kind letter, but the one which I have offered so often that I am really ashamed to mention it again, so trusting to you levity, I shall merely promise, that I will not be so negligent in future. I need not inform you with what delight yours was received, and with what pleasure I saw that my dear Brother had not forgotten me. I intend to answer his letter very soon. I feel much obliged to to to for the Money which you sent. I believe that I have not before acknowledged the receipt of it. There has been very great excitement in this place, concerning the Comet, Our little Rector has examined it with his Telescope, and has arrived at the conclusions that it nearer the Earth, than any has been known, within a considerable length of time, I dont remember exactly the period. I think it truly a beautiful phenomenon. We have had a snow

on the ground for the last two weeks, of the depth of several inches, which rendered the walking to School extremely unpleasant. One week we were all obliged to take holiday. I have taken some very fine sleigh rides. This is the first spring day that there has been this month, I really fear that we shall have no flowers or or or which is more distressing no fruit. At least unless the weather greatly changes. There is an old weather Wizzard Wizard living here, who has predicted one more snow this Spring, which will be six feet deep , but I must confess that I have not much faith in his predictions. Cousin Sam will be in Jackson next week. Oh! you have no idea how sincerely I wish that I was in his his place for indeed it appears to me, that I should be perfectly, happy if I could see you all again, but I console with the idea that I have only three more months to be sepperated separated from you. Why does not Aunts N Narcissa and Patsey write to me, Tell them they are both in debt to me for one letter. Ask Aunt P Patsey for me if Home does not feel very dear to her, as she has been away from it; I suppose she is capable of judging. Certainly There is no place like Home: but do not infer from this that I am not pleased with Columbia , on the contrary I like it very much indeed; I greatly prefer boarding with Cousin Ellen than at the Institute, for it is too confining. I want you to kiss Sam & the Children as often as you can possibly spare time to do it in. Give my very best love to all my dear Relations. Mary Chester
