Nashville Decbr December 21st 1842 Dr Dear Sir I was obliged to take an unexpected trip to the remote portion of Arkansas , and pucuin on my return that a letter of mine to Dr Bukman did not reach him. My purpose was to look after some claims of my wife to lands in Arkansas which from various causes were in jeopardy. The time consumed by the journey was much greater than I anticipated, and from that cause and a confinement of some four weeks to my bed on account of a surgical operation to which I was obliged to submit, I am in arrears to much of my business, and particularly to you. I shall stay in town to night for the purpose of writing you fully, by the next mail. I have hardly more than time before the mail closes, of noticing the reference you were kind enough to make to me of Judge Bragg s letter, on the subject of the use making in North Carolina

of certain declaration ascribed by young Branch to Genl General Jackson . I have talked with the Genl on the subject who was not more surprised than I was, and who could find no authority for such declaration in any thing he has ever said or written. Mr B is in Nashville and is I find a friend of Mr Calhoun , but he is without influence and I have not thought it necessary yet to let him know how ridiculous the truth would make his statements appear. But there is curently an attempt to weaken the obligation under which the Democracy stand to you, and the Genl as you will perceive by the enclosed copy, strikes at it in his usual fearless manner. The oppurtunity opportunity was furnished by an invitation from Philadelphia and I am clearly of opinion that it was right to make it available, for the purpose of silening all such intrigues as those of Dr. Ewien & others.
