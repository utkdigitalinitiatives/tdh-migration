Columbia Tenn. Tennessee April 30th 1843 My dear Papa, It has been so long since I wrote you, that I really feel fearful, I shall not easily obtain forgiveness But the Examination is approaching very rapidly, and I am obliged to apply more of my precious time to my studies. I am in hopes that by very close application, I can graduate this Summer. I wish that you would write to Mr. Smith upon the subject, but not mention that I have said any thing to you about it. I have a great many studies every hour in the day I am busy. I practice on the Piano and Guitar two hours after school is dismissed. I intend teaching Sister Martha French when I return, I am sure she will be pleased with it. I dont do not think myself very competant competent of Teaching, yet all that I know I can teach — I was perfectly delighted to hear from Cousin Sam that Aunt B Butter had some idea of visiting Nashville & Columbia this next month. Oh! I know it would be very pleasant as well to herself as to me. Tell Brother John that he has no idea how very much pleasure his very kind letter afforded me, indeed I thought it very generous in him to send me half of

money. I was truly pleased to hear that he was enough of a Man to do business. Now that the "ice is broken", I hope he will write me often. I was surprised to hear that Rachel Trigg had not received a letter from me, for immediately after the reception of her's, I answered it but sent it to the Post Office by a little boy, & I suppose it must have been misplaced in some way, the next leisure moment that I have I shall write her again. I have a request to make, The first opportunity that offers itself, I wish you to send my Riding dress — You will find it in Sister's Wardrobe draw drawer ; I intend making it myself — It would astonish you to see how well I sew I make all my dresses, — but it is not proper to praise myself. The Time flies swiftly, only two months before I shall be with you. Oh! I do wish to see you all very much. Kiss the dear, dear children & give my love to all, all Your ever afft. affectionate Daughter M. J. Mary Jane Chester P. S. Post Script Give my love to Aunt Nancy , & all the servants.
