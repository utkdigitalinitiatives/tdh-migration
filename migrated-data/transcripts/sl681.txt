Now for the pay you will please be so good as to inform me what the price is & how I shall get the money to Nashville & I could pay it to any agent in Memphis or else where that will suit or enclose it by mail just as will be most convenient please write me so soon as you know; the reason I only want the whells wheels alone is I can have the other work done & not have to pay out money which is disierable desirable these hard times If it is not in your power to attend to it will be so good as to get some friend to do so please send them to Henry M Daniels & Merot Randolph your compliance will very much oblige your old whig friend Henry Adkins
