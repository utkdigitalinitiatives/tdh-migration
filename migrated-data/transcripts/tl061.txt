Knoxville 20 December 1807 The Agent and Superintendant Superintendent of the Creek Nation Sir Early in the last spring and summer two men Citizens of Tennessee , in the vicinity of Elk River , were murdered and Robed Robbed of their property in a most barbarous barbarious and egregious manner Myself and Colo. Colonel Meigs agent for the Cherokee Nation , have been at considerable trouble and pains to find out and ascertain who were the perpetrators of such shocking and unprovoked outrages. From every information we have collected, it appears and leaves with us no doubt, that some persons belonging to the Creek nation have been guilty of those atrocious and horrid murders. I am unwilling to suppose that the Creek cheifs chiefs would be base enough to encourage, or countenance such flagrant, and violent breaches of the existing Treaties, which subsist between them and the United States . I therefore request that you will have, or cause to be had, an immediate enquiry and investigation, and discover if possible, who have been the perpetrators of such bloody and Inhuman murders; and if committed by any of the people belonging to the Creek nation , that you cause them to be instantly punished agreably agreeably to the existing Treaties and laws of the United States , made and provided for in such Cases; otherwise, to deliver them to the proper Authority in order they may be dealt with conformably to the Treaties and laws Aforesaid It is

It is a fact, that parties of the Creek Indians have crossed the Tennessee frequently in the course of the last Spring and summer, and as frequently (exclusively of the murders alluded to) wantonly robed robbed and plundered a number of peaceable and helpless families Such enormities will not always be submitted to, and in order to support peace and harmony, the Executive of Tennessee , most earnestly request that the Cheifs Chiefs , will immeadiately immediately repress and put an end to such Violent outrages, and cause such lawless Banditties Bandits , to remain within their own bounds The Executive is penetrated with a due friendship to the Creek nation ; he might enlarge further on such a state of things, and circumstances so important, and so unexpected. but it would be as afflicting to him to state the facts, as it would be for you to hear them I have the honor to be Sir, with due consideration respect Your Mo.
