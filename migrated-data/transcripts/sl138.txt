General Jackson . enclosing a copy of your orders to me of the 12 & 14th Ulto. Ultimo with a statement to him of the situation of the Troops — deficiency in arms and with a request (if possible) to be furnished with arms by him. The Express returned on yesterday with advice from Genl. General Jackson. an Extract of which I have the honor to detail. " Genl. General Taylor having stated that your Commissions were of the same date, I refered referred the Genl. General to Genl. General Cocke , whose duty it is to determine which of you are to command, I have wrote to Major Genl. General Cocke enclosing him an extract from the rules of War by which he is to decide . The Copy of the Orders to you from Major Genl. General Cocke of the 12 & 14 Ulto. Ultimo has relieved me from the embarrisment embarrassment avarioned? by his order of the 20th. In his of the 12th. to you he orders you expressly to take the command of the Bregade Brigade from his Division ordered into the service of the UStates United States and proceed to organize them, and his order of the 14 directs that you should march them to my Head Quarters — You will therefore continue to command the Brigade until otherwise commanded by Major Genl.

mustered into service. but as they are in the Field, and from the requicition requisition made on me by the Governor of the State, in pursuance of an order from the War Department for 500 men to march to Mobile for its protection. all the six months men will be needed that have been ordered and they must be well Armed"— Therefore in pursuance of Major Genl. General Jacksons, Order I am necessitated to call on you for Two hundred good Guns if they can possibly be obtained. we had better have no men in the Field than have them without Arms. I have sent Major Bradly with orders to report to you, who will assist you in procuring the amount of the requisition. I have also detached Capt. Captain Lauren with a party of men into the settlements of E. East Tennessee to procure all that he can, what is calculated at about 30 or 40.
