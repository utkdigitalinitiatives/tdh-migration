				discovered near the former site of the mid-18th century Chota townhouse. Pits
				were dug by the Cherokees for burial purposes and for the storage of refuse.
				This excavation was conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1969 in
				anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico
				Dam Reservoir. The university worked under contract with the National Park
				Service and TVA. Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J.
