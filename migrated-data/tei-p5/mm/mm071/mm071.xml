               <note type="summary"> This photograph is of a reconstructed
				blockhouse at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane
				County, Tennessee. There are four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort, with
				two blockhouses located at the west end of the fort and the other two located
				at the east end. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse
				post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers
				from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal
				troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their
				rights on the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was
				established as the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974,
				archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six
				fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many
				fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of
				Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen
				buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and
				several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary
				excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the
				total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a ore detailed
				examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several
				historic and prehistoric features. Additional excavations were conducted at
				Fort Southwest Point in the 1990s yielded new information as to the fort's
				original layout and functions, as well as the life ways of the people who
				occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was given to the city of Kingston by
				the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is now used as a historical and
				recreational area.</note>
