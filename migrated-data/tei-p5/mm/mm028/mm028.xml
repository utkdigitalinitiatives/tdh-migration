               <note type="summary">This photograph is of glass trade beads, kaolin
				pipe fragments, and small metal button fragments found in excavations of the
				mid-18th century Cherokee village of Chota. The Overhill Cherokees traded
				actively with the lower Cherokees of Georgia and South Carolina. Chota was
				recognized by Europeans as well as other Indians for its powerful economic
				influence and was regarded as the capital of the Cherokee nation. Excavations
				of Chota and other Overhill villages were conducted by the University of
				Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project
				in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the
				Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the
				National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal
				investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J. Worth Greene.</note>
