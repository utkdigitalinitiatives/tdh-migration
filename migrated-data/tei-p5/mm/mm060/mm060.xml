               <note type="summary"> This photograph is of a reconstructed Cherokee
				cabin at the Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee.
				The cabin is a chinked log cabin with two stories. There are also reconstructed
				outbuildings that would have associated with the Cherokee farmers' homesteads
				of the time. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the right
				to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave away
				their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota,
				Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of
				Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together. Thus, Red Clay
				became the seat of the Cherokee government in 1832 and lasted until the removal
				of the Cherokees to the west in 1838. Red Clay was composed of 11 general
				councils and the meetings were attended by up to 5000 people. It was at Red
				Clay that the Cherokee learned that they had lost all of their land and would
				be removed to the west. Red Clay consists of the sacred Blue Hole Spring, a
				reconstructed council house, and several reconstructed homestead homestead
				buildings. Red Clay is also the home to the Eternal Flame, lit on April 6,
				1984. The Cherokees took hot coals from their council fire at Red Clay on the
				Trail of Tears. The flame was later taken to Cherokee, North Carolina in the
				1950s but was returned to Red Clay in 1984. This was the first symbolic step
				unifying the Eastern Cherokees with the Cherokee nation in Oklahoma since their
				removal in 1838. Today Red Clay State Historical Park is not only a historical
				site, but is also an interpretive site on the Trail of Tears.</note>
