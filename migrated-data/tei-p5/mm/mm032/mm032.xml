               <note type="summary">This photograph is of a European manufactured
				iron ax head traded to the Cherokees in the mid-18th century. It was recovered
				by the University of Tennessee during an excavation of the Overhill Cherokee
				village of Chota. Chota was recognized by Europeans as well as other Indians
				for its powerful economic influence and was regarded as the capital of the
				Cherokee nation. Excavations of Chota were conducted from 1969-1974 in
				anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico
				Dam Reservoir. The university worked under contract with the National Park
				Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator,
				Alfred K. Guthe. Field Directors, J. Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F.
				Schroedl.</note>
