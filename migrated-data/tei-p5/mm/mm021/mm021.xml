               <note type="summary">This is a drawing of a posthole pattern of an
				18th century Cherokee winter townhouse at Mialoquo. Overhill townhouses were
				situated in a common village plaza. There was generally a winter townhouse,
				which was a large circular dome in which a fire could be built in the center
				and an adjacent rectangular open pavilion for summer use. Both were used for
				public social and political activity. Excavations of Mialoquo were conducted by
				the University of Tennessee in 1977 as part of the Tellico Archaeological
				Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by
				the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with
				the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal
				investigator, Jefferson Chapman. Field Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</note>
