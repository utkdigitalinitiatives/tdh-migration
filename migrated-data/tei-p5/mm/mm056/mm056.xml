               <note type="summary">This photograph is of a reconstructed blockhouse
				at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County,
				Tennessee. There are four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort, with two
				blockhouses located at the west end of the fort and the other two located at
				the east end. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post
				for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from
				Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops
				whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on
				the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as
				the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from
				the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building
				foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period
				artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and
				the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These
				buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several
				buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation
				in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to
				fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a more detailed examination of
				the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and
				prehistoric features. Additional excavations were conducted at Fort Southwest
				Point in the 1990s yielded new information as to the fort's original layout and
				functions, as well as the life ways of the people who occupied the fort. Fort
				Southwest Point was given to the city of Kingston by the Tennessee Valley
				Authority (TVA) and is now used as a historical and recreational area. </note>
