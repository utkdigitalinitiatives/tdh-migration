               <note type="summary">This is a photograph of a pit-feature at the
				Overhill Cherokee town of Tomotley. The pit was originally used to recover soil
				or to store food, and was later filled with refuse. Excavations of Overhill
				Cherokee villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967
				and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued
				until 1983, and laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987.
				The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower
				Little Tennessee River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam
				Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park
				Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal Investigator,
				Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, Gerald F. Schrodel.</note>
