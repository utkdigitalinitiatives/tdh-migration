               <note type="summary">This photograph is of gunflints, musket balls,
				and a lockplate, all of which were mid-18th century trade items of the
				Cherokees found in archaeological excavations of Chota in what is today Monroe
				County. Chota was recognized by Europeans as well as other Indians for its
				powerful economic influence and was regarded as the capital of the Cherokee
				nation. Excavations of Chota and other Overhill villages were conducted by the
				University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico
				Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little
				Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted
				under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley
				Authority (TVA).</note>
