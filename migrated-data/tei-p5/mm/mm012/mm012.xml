               <note type="summary">This is a (1974 ?) facsimile of a map,
				originally drawn in 1762 by British army officer Henry Timberlake, depicting
				the Overhill Cherokee villages in the lower Little Tennessee River Valley. This
				map shows the villages of Toskegee [Tuskeegee], Tomotley [Tomotley], and
				Settaco [Citico], which were among the 60 Cherokee settlements in the
				Southeastern states during the 18th century. Lieutenant Timberlake went to the
				village of Chota, considered to be the capital of the Cherokee settlements, in
				1761 to explain the provisions of a peace treaty with the colonists after the
				siege of Fort Loudoun. Timberlake lived among the Cherokees for a year and
				visited many of the Overhill villages.</note>
