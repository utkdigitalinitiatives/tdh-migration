               <note type="summary">This is a photograph of mid-18th century
				European silver broaches and earrings recovered from excavations at the
				Overhill Cherokee Village of Chota. Chota or Echota was an Overhill Cherokee
				village located in what is today Monroe County, Tennessee. In the mid-18th
				century, Chota was recognized by Europeans as well as other Indians for its
				powerful socio-economic influence and was regarded as the capital of the
				Cherokee Nation. Chota, as with all the Overhill Cherokee sites, is now
				inundated by the Tellico Reservoir. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee villages
				were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of
				the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and
				laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations
				were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee
				River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and
				the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal Investigator, Alfred K.
				Guthe.</note>
