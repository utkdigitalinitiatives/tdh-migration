               <note type="summary">This is a photograph of a small pit filled with
				charred corn cobs used to smudge ceramic vessels or to process deer hides at
				the Overhill Cherokee Village of Tanasee (Tanasi). Tanasee is sometimes
				referred to as Chota-Tanasi as the two towns were very close together. Chota
				and Tanassee were two of over 60 Cherokee settlements in the Southeastern
				states during the 18th century. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee villages were
				conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the
				Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and
				laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations
				were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee
				River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The
				excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and
				the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal Investigator, Alfred K. Guthe.
				Field Director, J. Worth Greene.</note>
