               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a talk from the General Council of the Cherokee Nation to U.S. treaty commissioners Duncan G. Campbell and James Meriwether, dated October 27, 1823.  The Council rebuts a number of unfounded accusations made by the commissioners in a recent talk they delivered.  The Cherokee Council explains that they have no more land to sell and thus, negotiating a treaty for further land cessions would be useless.  They refer to the Treaty of Holston and numerous other treaties in developing their argument.  The talk is signed by a number of important Cherokee leaders including Pathkiller, Major Ridge, and John Ross.</note>
