               <note type="summary" anchored="true">Letter dated April 25, 1823 from the Cherokee Council to (U.S. Commissioners Duncan G. Campbell and James Meriwether ?) in response to a communication from these commissioners. The Council considers the commissioners' plea to repeal a resolution which disallows further land cession so that the commissioners can meet with the Council in Taloney and proceed with further negotiations. The Council responds in the negative, stating that the resolution was made to promote the interest and happiness of the Cherokee people and that no meeting will take place in Taloney because the seat of government is in New Town. A lengthy extract from the commissioners' letter follows which sets out arguments for the Cherokees to agree to further land cessions and remove west.</note>

            </opener>
            <p>The undersigned chiefs in behalf of the <name>Cherokee Nation</name> convened in council for the purpose of taking into consideration your communication of the <date when="--02-10">10th February last</date> urging the repeal of the Resolutions of <date when="1822-10">October 1822</date>.  So that a convention may take place at <name type="place">Taloney</name> on the <date when="--08-09">9th <add place="supralinear">day </add> August next</date> for the purpose of entering into various topics of negotiation with you as <name type="place">United States</name> commissioners.  We have therefore maturely considered the subject contained in your several communications to our Head Chief, Mr. <name type="person">Charles R. Hicks</name> and to the nation.  Brothers, It is with deep regret we have noticed the feeling with which you have expressed your sentiments towards the Resolutions of <date when="1822-10">October 1822</date>. and the course which have been pursued by the nation in not meeting you at the Agency in <date when="--01">January last</date>; and this strict <choice>

                  <reg>adherence</reg>
               </choice> to those Resolutions  you have thought proper to denounce those resolutions as being <hi>premature</hi>, <hi>disrespectful</hi> and of <hi>dangerous tendency</hi>.  Brothers; Surely you could not have read those resolutions with attention, or otherwise you could<pb n="2" facs="ch067b.small.jpg"/>not with due reflection have asserted what has been declared by the committee and council as emanating from <del type="overstrike">mature</del>
               <hi>mature deliberation</hi>, to be premature.  Brothers, We declare in behalf of the nation and ourselves, that those Resolutions were adopted from just and proper motives, being actuated from an impulse of preserving and promoting the true interest and happiness of the <name type="person">Cherokee</name> People, and that no disrespect or contempt to the general Government or to her commissioners are offered or intended.  So far is it from any such intention, that the concluding part of the general Resolution observes <q>but on any other business not relating to making a Treaty of cession we will at all times during the Session of the National Council at <name type="place">New Town</name> receive the <name type="place">United States</name> Commissioners or agents with friendship and cordiality, and will even keep <hi>bright</hi> the <hi>chain</hi> of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>friendship</hi> which <hi>links</hi> the <hi>
                     <name>Cherokee Nation</name>
                  </hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>
                     <name type="place">United States</name>
                  </hi>,</q> Such are the sentiments which you have so strongly protested against, as being <hi>premature</hi>, <hi>disrespectful</hi>, and of <hi>dangerous tendency</hi>, and so desirous that the chiefs should repeal so that a convention may take place on the <date when="--08-09">9th August next</date> at <name type="place">Taloney</name>, and the difficulties and breach which has taken place, between the President and his favorite Indian children may be healed."

            <p>If these your expressions, flow from deliberate reflections and be your <hi>real</hi> construction of the Sentiments which we have quoted from the aforesaid Resolution  We are really at a loss how you could suppose that we could ever agree with your ideas, how to promote the <hi>welfare</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi> of the <name type="person">Cherokees</name>, when your object is to obtain their lands, and to seek compensation for things which have long since been solemnly adjusted by a Treaty and forgotten.   Brothers, in adhering to our Resolutions we neither offer <hi>disrespect, contempt</hi> or refused to receive Ministers or commissioners of the <name type="place">U. States</name>  during the sitting of the council which adopted this general Resolution, a communication, accompanying a copy of the Resolution was forwarded by the Chiefs in Council, to the Honorable Secretary of War and a letter was also written to the then agent <name type="person">

                  <reg>occurrences</reg>
               </choice>, we now declare to you that the Resolution of Council emanated from due regard to the interest, happiness, and prosperity, of the <name type="person">Cherokee</name> People and that its adoption <choice>
                  <sic>was founded was founded</sic>
                  <corr>was founded</corr>
               </choice> upon <hi>mature deliberation</hi> and that it will be strictly <del type="overstrike"> adhered to</del> observed and cannot be repealed  and further  that we do hereby solemnly protest before God  man against the nation meeting you at <name type="place">Taloney</name> on the <date when="--08-09">9th August next</date> as you <add place="supralinear">have</add> suggested   We have but one seat for our General Council, which is at <name type="place">New Town</name>, and should you come forward during our next General Council at that place, the Committee  Council will take you by the hand as Friends  Brothers and hear what you have to say on the subject of your mission.  We know of no instance of Ministers or Commissioners to a foreign court persisting in selecting a spot remote from the Seat of Government to which their embassy were directed for negotiation; and of taking it entirely upon themselves to fix the time for a convention.  We make these remarks, because you have intimated that "a refusal to receive <pb n="5" facs="ch067e.small.jpg"/>Government by which you have been preserved and fostered.  Other Governments would have triumphed in your downfall, and held you down by cruelty, and oppression.  Such has not been the conduct of the <name type="place">United States</name>.  She has set an example which the whole civilized world ought to feel proud, to follow. It has been your unhappy lot to be shut out  from the advantage which many others enjoy;  It has been the constant study and exertion, of the government to relieve, you from, your unfortunate condition.  The struggle has been long but not in vain.  What was promised you by your first father <name type="person"> 
                  <reg>George</reg> Washington</name>, has been fully performed by those great friends of mankind who have followed him.  Under the kind protection of these earthly fathers you have been taught that you have a father above to whom you are accountable.  It should be your pride to act up to the <add place="supralinear">near</add> relationship which exists between you and the <name type="place">United States</name>   If the President practices towards you the kind treatment of father, it becomes your duty, to return the obedience and gratitude of children.  You have received this kindness from government from the close of the Revolutionary war up to the present time.
                     
                  </p>
            <p>The President acknowledges that you deserve it by the steadiness of your fidelity.  Your conduct as a Nation has been peaceable and harmless, although some of your <pb n="6" facs="ch067f.small.jpg"/>citizens, have been at times restless and troublesome.
                  </p>
            <p>We doubt not but that some of our citizens are liable to the same charges.  You have embraced the only, opportunity which has <choice>
                  <orig>occured</orig>
                  <reg>occurred</reg>
               </choice>, of showing, that you are <choice>

                  <reg>Warriors</reg>
               </choice>, and that you are faithful to the country.</p>
            <p>In the last War you were found bravely fighting by the side of the white man, your brother; against the enemies of liberty.  These enemies would have seduced you if they could, and after making you traitors to your father the President, they would have become traitors to you.   There would have followed a scene of desolation, at which every good man and Christian would weep;  It was your fidelity which prevented it, and the hand of the red man  the whiteman were not raised against each other.  The redman and the whiteman now are brothers, and long may they so continue</p>
            <p>Brothers, these remarks have grown out of feelings which have been inspired by our acquaintance with you.  Coming as we do clothed in the high authority of the <name type="place">United States</name>, we are left to speak the undisguised sentiments of sincerity,  We have done so and hope and expect to be met in the same spirit of conciliation and friendship.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="ch067g.small.jpg"/>
            <p>Having made these remarks, we now proceed to lay before you the subject of our mission.  We know that it is one which you have anticipated and upon which you have already expressed <del type="overstrike">an opinion</del> yourselves with some earnestness <del type="overstrike">
                  <unclear/>
               </del>.  We must ask you to suspend any conclusion <choice>
                  <orig>untill</orig>
                  <reg>until</reg>
               </choice> we have <add place="supralinear">carried</add> the matter through a calm and deliberate discussion.  The whole of the authorities of the nation are now around their great council fire, with power to do any act they may think proper.  The authority of the <name type="place">United States</name> is also present.  Any contract which may be now concluded will be binding on both parties.</p>
            <p>We propose to purchase of the <name>Cherokee Nation</name> the <hi>whole</hi> or a <hi>part of the territory</hi> now occupied by them and lying within the chartered limits of the State of <name type="place">Georgia</name>.  We do not confine ourselves to <name type="place">Georgia</name> limits, because we are <name type="person">Georgians</name>, but because the President has appointed us at the instance of <name type="place">Georgia</name> and instructed us accordingly.  We will give you the reasons why a purchase is pressed by the general government for the use of <name type="place">Georgia</name>.  Previous to the <date when="1802-04-24">24th day of April 1802</date>, <name type="place">Georgia</name> held the right of Sovereignty over an immense space of <del type="overstrike">territory</del> country extending even out to the<pb n="8" facs="ch067h.small.jpg"/>
               <name type="place">Mississippi River</name>.  The general government seeing <del type="overstrike">that</del> that the territory was too large to be contained within the limits of one State, made application to <name type="place">Georgia</name> for the purchase of a part of it.  This was for the purpose of organizing new States, and having them settled and populated for the better defence of the country in case of war.  <name type="place">Georgia</name> listened to the application of her father the President, and sold all the land which now lies in the States of <name type="place">Mississippi</name> and <name type="place">Alabama</name>.  This happened on the day above Stated.  At the same time, in consideration of this sale, the <name type="place">United States</name> bound herself "at her own expense to extinguish for the use of <name type="place">Georgia</name> as early as the same could be peaceably <del type="overstrike">and reasonably</del> obtained <del type="overstrike">and</del> on reasonable terms, the Indian title "to all lands within the State of <name type="place">Georgia</name>.  The limits of <name type="place">Georgia</name> are known to you, and the amount of territory occupied by you within those limits is also known to you.  For greater certainty , however concerning those limits, and the obligations of the <name type="place">United States</name> to the State of <name type="place">Georgia</name>, we refer you to the articles of agreement and cession entered into on the day and year aforesaid, between, <name type="person">James Jackson</name>, <pb n="9" facs="ch067i.small.jpg"/>

            <p>By these articles you discover the rights of <name type="place">Georgia</name> and the obligations of the <name type="place">United States</name>.  That these rights may be fulfilled and these obligations discharged, is the important object of the present mission.  The sovereignty of the country which you occupy, is in the <name type="place">United States</name> alone.  No State or foreign power can enter into a treaty or compact with you.  These privileges have passed away, and your intercourse is restricted, exclusively to the <name type="place">United States</name>.

We concede that the terms must be "peaceable" and "reasonable".  Our offer to purchase, establishes the first, and the consideration which may be agreed on, we trust, will be satisfactory as to the second.</p>

A portion of this Nation is already there.  If those with whom we are now treating are disposed to emigrate, then we offer territory in exchange of such extent, and accompanied by such other advantages, as may be agreed on.  If this offer is not acceptable then we submit another, equally "peaceable" and <del type="overstrike">
                  <unclear/>
               </del> equally  "reasonable".  It is that you cede to the <name type="place">United States</name>, for the use of <name type="place">Georgia</name>, such part of the territory within her limits as can be easily spared.  Many reasons might be given which have induced <name type="place">Georgia</name> to urge her claim for land upon the general government.</p>
            <p>The reasons have appeared satisfactory to the Legislature and Governor of <name type="place">Georgia</name>, and to the President  Congress of the <name type="place">United States</name>.  Some of these reasons grow out of <add place="supralinear">the</add> political connection of the <name type="place">

            <p>It is not necessary to detail the first, they are <hi>urgent</hi> and must at some time have their weight.  The last are plain to the view of every one who travels through that part of the Presidents dominion,   </p>
