            <p> It is a part of my official duty to cause all white persons residing within the territory of the State, occupied by the <name type="person">Cherokees</name> to be removed therefrom, who refuse to take the oath to support the constitution and laws of the State</p>
            <p>Information has been received of your continued residence within that territory, without complying with the requisites of the law, and of your claim to be exempted from its operation, on an account of your holding the office of postmaster of <name type="place">New Echota</name>.</p>
            <p>You have no doubt been informed of your dismissal from that office.  That you may be under no mistake as to this matter, you are also informed the government of the <name type="place">United States</name> does not <choice>

Whatever may have been your conduct in opposing the humane policy of the general government, or exciting the Indians to oppose the jurisdiction of the State,<pb n="2" facs="ch044b.small.jpg"/>I am still desirous of giving you and all others similarly situated, an opportunity of avoiding the punishment which will certainly follow your further residence within the state contrary to its laws.  You are therefore, advised to remove from the territory of <name type="place">Georgia</name>, occupied by the <name type="person">Cherokees</name>.
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="person">Col. Sanford</name>, the commander of the Guard, will be requested to have this letter delivered to you, and to delay your arrest until you shall have had an opportunity of leaving the State.</p>
