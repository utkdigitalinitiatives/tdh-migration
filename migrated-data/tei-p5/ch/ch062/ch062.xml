            <p>I return herewith the Bill "relative to mines"  which originated in your house and passed the National Council near the close of the last session  The preamble to the Bill as well as <del type="overstrike"> the</del>
               <add place="supralinear">its</add> provisions bears evidence of haste and it is open to objections, in my opinion, both as to principle and detail.  Believing that the General welfare of the Country would not be promoted by the opening of mines of valuable minerals which would serve the purpose of attracting a large number of persons to the Country not responsible to its laws or amenable to its authorities, I am opposed to entering upon the subject at all at this time.  Nor do I think that we are possessed of sufficient information <del type="overstrike"> upon in regard</del> as to the existence of minerals in our Country <del type="overstrike">to legislate wisely or </del> either as to their Kind, extent or richness to legislate wisely in regard to them.  If mines of ordinary richness exist in the Country the privileges <del type="overstrike">proposed</del>
               <unclear>conferred</unclear> by the Bill are enormous and greater than should be conferred upon a company  The second section of the Bill confers a large jurisdiction upon the District Courts, a wide discretion upon <del type="overstrike">its</del> the Judges of those Courts and confines its powers in <del type="overstrike">to</del> determining <del type="overstrike">the</del> question of priority in the <pb n="2" facs="ch062b.small.jpg"/>"registration" of a mine without providing for the settlement of Controversies arising as to the priority of their <hi>discovery</hi> the only <del type="overstrike">only</del> one that could be productive of a <del type="overstrike">
                  <unclear/>
               </del> controversy that would not be settled by a simple reference to the register in <del type="overstrike">the</del> the <unclear>judges</unclear>
               <del type="overstrike">
                  <unclear/>
               </del> office  <del type="overstrike">And for <unclear/>
               </del> The  <unclear/> to be allowed the Nation, the Method of its collection and the compensation <del rend="overstrike">for</del> of the Supervising Agents are not such as are calculated to avoid confusion and inefficiency.
               </p>
            <p>For these reasons and others which will doubtless suggest themselves to your minds on more mature reflection, I respectfully withhold my signature from the Bill</p>
