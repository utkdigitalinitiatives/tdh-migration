               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a typed excerpt from a speech delivered by Edward Everett, a Senator from Massachusetts, on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on May 19, 1830.  The speech was printed in the Congressional Debates, Vol. VI, pt. 2, and pertains to the proposed removal of the Southeastern Indians to a territory west of the Mississippi River.  The typed excerpt presented here is from a portion of Everett's speech in which he describes the current conditions of the Cherokee people by enumerating statistics relative to population and property.  This excerpt contains several minor variations from Everett's original wording.</note>
