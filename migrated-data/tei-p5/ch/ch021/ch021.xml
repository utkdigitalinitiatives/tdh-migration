               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter from a delegation of Cherokee leaders, including John Ross, William S. Coody, Edward Gunter, and Richard Taylor, to  Peter B. Porter, Secretary of War (1828-1829), dated January 29, 1829.  The delegation informs Porter that none of the Cherokee claims for property loss have yet been paid, under provisions of the Treaty of Tellico (1804), nor have claims for improvements under the treaties of 1817 and 1819 been paid.  In addition, they also discuss lingering questions regarding the continuing education of Cherokee children and the unauthorized payment of a portion of the Cherokee annuity to  Cherokees in Arkansas.</note>

            <p>Having paid you our respects, and apprized you of our appointment to transact business with the General Govt. in behalf of the <name>Cherokee Nation</name>, we shall now lay before you some of the subjects embraced in the subject of our mission.</p>
            <p>We will first call your attention to the various individual <add place="supralinear">
                  <name type="person">Cherokee</name>
               </add> claims for property stolen by citizens of the <name type="place">United States</name>. By reference to the Treaty of <name type="place">Telico</name> it will be perceived that a special provision is made for the indemnification of stolen property. Some of those claims are of long standing, were long since laid before the Department of War, and <choice>

                  <reg>referred</reg>
               </choice> to We hope they will be disposed of without much further delay.  We would next call your attention to the claims for improvements abandoned on the ceded lands under the Treaties of <date when="1817">1817</date>
               <date when="1819">'19</date>. which have been transmitted to the Department by <name type="person">

                  </choice> Montgomery</name>, some reasons are assigned in the report of the agent why those improvements were not valued and paid for in the first place, but we will take the liberty to remark, that some excitement prevailed among the Natives in that particular section of Country arising from the Treaty, as the lands on which they resided had been ceded to the <name type="place">U. States</name>. <name type="person">Mr. Starr</name>
               <add place="supralinear">perhaps</add> apprehending some evil did not choose to visit the different habitations so as to make a correct estimate of the value of the improvements, but met with <pb n="3" facs="ch021c.small.jpg"/> an Indian who informed him that the people in his Town did not wish to have their improvements valued and returned home without executing the business confided to him. It is evident that the failure to value the improvements at the time was owing to the neglect of the officer of the Government, consequently the claimants should not be deprived of the provisions provided for them in the Treaty that ceded their lands, nor do we consider their demands <choice>

This sum was regularly paid until the year <date when="1827">1827</date> when for reasons entirely unknown to us it was stopped. We can see no just or reasonable grounds for discontinuing

The <name type="place">Unicoi Turnpike</name> Company having failed to comply with the requisitions of their agreement with the <name>Cherokee Nation</name>s for several years, the Agent was instructed by the <choice>
