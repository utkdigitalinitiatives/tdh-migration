               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter from William H. Thomas, legal representative of the North Carolina Cherokees, dated November 11, 1857 to the acting Secretary of the Treasury regarding a number of treaties, acts, and resolutions specific to the payment of annuities to the eastern Cherokees. Thomas quotes from several of these legal documents in arguing for the appropriate payments due the North Carolina Cherokees and pointing out obvious discrepancies in the federal policies.

            <p>In the instructions referred to which appear to have been signed; but never examined by <name type="person">Mr Guthrie</name>, the following is the then opinion upon the payment of the interest<q rend="block">
                  <emph>It has been decided that the annuity in every case ceases with the death of the Indian, and that the proper representative of such Indian can receive only the annuity up to the time of his death.  In all such cases therefore you will make the compensation at the rate of 6.39, per annum</emph> from the <date when="1851-07-29">29th of July 1851</date> to<pb n="7"/> the day of the death of the Indian and pay the representatives of the amount due according to such computation instead of the amount assumed to be due in the statement.
                        </q>
            </p>
            <p>The foregoing opinion contains conclusive evidence that <name type="person">Mr Guthrie</name> never examined either it or the law to which it refers, I will repeat the evidence on which this assertion is based.  The law made provision for the payment of six percent interest upon the sum of 53.33, which gives as the annual payment 3.19 98/100.  In the opinion of <name type="person">Mr Gutherie</name> or one of his subordinates it is said after stating that the interest would not be paid after the death of the Indian, it is stated that the agent would make the rate of <emph>compensation at the rate of 6.39 per annum, from the <date when="1851-07-29">29th of July 1851</date> to the day of the death of the Indian</emph>, can any one imagine that the <abbr>HonHonorable</abbr> Secretary of the Treasury of the <name type="place">United States</name> would have committed this error if he had<pb n="8"/> examined either the law or the opinion.  If he had examined the law he would have seen that it was but six percent allowed the Indian, giving annual annuity of 319. 98/100, if he had examined the decision he would have seen that it was allowing twelve instead of six percent interest double as much as authorized by the law.  The conclusion therefore seems <choice>
                  <orig>irresistable</orig>
                  <reg>irresistible</reg>
               </choice> that the opinion over this signature was not his opinion because it will not do to adopt the opposite conclusion <del type="overstrike">because then it would be supposed</del> that he was incapable of calculating simple interest.
                     </p>
            <p>But in addition to the absurd <unclear>contradiction</unclear> in the opinion reputed to Mr. <unclear>

                     <reg>Mr.</reg> Gutherie</name>'s</unclear> it is in direct opposition to the views entertained by Congress upon making payment to the <name type="person">Cherokees</name> of the principal as shown by the act of <date when="1855">1855</date> chap 204<pb n="9"/> page 700, <q type="block">And be it further <unclear>enacted</unclear> That the Secretary of the interior is hereby authorized and required to cause to be paid to the <name type="place">North Carolina</name>

            </p>
            <p>I have now shown that the accounting offices of the Treasury and his secretaries decided in favor of paying interest to the legal representative of the Indians while the Government retained the possession of the principal.</p>
            <pb n="10"/>

               </choice> of the accounting <unclear>officers</unclear> of the Treasury.  To establish this position I beg to leave to refer you to the opinion of <name type="person">William Wirt</name> Attorney General vol 1. p 624, given upon the construction of the laws establishing the Treasury Department, In which opinion he says,<q rend="block">With regard to the comptroller it directs that is shall be his duty to superintend the adjustment and preservation of all public accounts settled by the Auditor and certify the balance arising thereon to the Register no right of appeal <emph>from his decision to the President</emph>, (see act of <date when="1809-03-03">3rd March 1809</date>, vol 4 p 221, sec 2) makes it the duty of the comptroller to direct the Auditor<pb n="11"/> to audit and settle any particular amount and to report such settlement for his revision and final decision, so also the act of <date when="1817-03-03">3rd March 1817</date>, which introduces the present organization of the Treasury Department <lb/>Thus in every instance <emph>the decision of the Comptroller is declared to be final</emph> and it is manifest that the law contemplates no further examination by any officer, after such decision.
