               <note type="summary" anchored="true">Cherokee Council minutes which include a talk from Joseph McMinn, Governor of Tennessee dated May 1818. McMinn presents the Treaty of the Cherokee Agency, July 8, 1817, before the Cherokee and Arkansas, and he discusses the federal government's plan for the removal of Indian Nations east of the Mississippi and the "civilization" of these people.  The council minutes following McMinn's address appear to be in a different hand, but seem connected contextually.</note>

You have now heard the Treaty read and you have listened well, And I hope by a friendly conversation with each Other, you will be able to give it a proper construction, and to satisfy the minds of those who have never had an Opportunity of being informed of its true intent and meaning; and so soon as that is done it will put a total stop, to all disputes which have so unhappily<pb n="2" facs="ch060b.small.jpg"/>Divided for some time past a Nation of People whose former habits and customs with each Other were well calculated to make them happy, and to restore this <choice>

            <p>Friends and Brothers.  We who are present here have met for purposes which I earnestly hope will produce much good to both red and whites, we all possess equal rights to speak.  And I hope now will return  home from this place, who either wish to make remarks on the Treaty or to ask questions respecting it, which I promise to answer in the most satisfactory manner, within my power.</p>
            <p>Friends and Brothers It is my duty on this occasion to call your attention back as far as the period when your Father <name type="person"> 
                  <reg>George</reg> Washington</name> was president of the <name type="place">United States</name>; it was him alone that laid the foundation of your past present and future prosperity: his Fatherly eye foresaw the danger to which you would be exposed from his white children living so near to his red childrens settlements: he<pb n="4" facs="ch060d.small.jpg"/>Therefore resolved upon taking such measures with you; as in due time would render you fit, for a state of Civil Society; and make you members of his own great family: to effect this human and generous plan, with the least possible delay he ordered you to be furnished with all the implements of Husbandry; and your women with wheels looms <unclear>Chards</unclear>

               </choice> and feed your families; which he knew could not much longer be done by the Gun and the Bow; as your game was nearly gone.  He Ordered Schools to be kept giving light to your minds, not less for the purpose of enabling you to form a correct knowledge of the great Spirit above, than for acquiring the art of reading and writing, without which you would be unable to transact your trade and intercourse with one another.
               </p>
            <p>With these advantages derived from the <name type="place">United States</name> you contented yourselves, until the latter part of the year <date when="1808">1808</date>; when two depu<pb n="5" facs="ch060e.small.jpg"/>tations went  on to the City of <name type="place">Washington</name> conducted by your agent <name type="person">Colonel Meigs</name>; One of whom addressed <name type="person">Mr. Jefferson</name> the President of the <name type="place">United States</name>; by expressing a desire to be engaged in the pursuits of agriculture and civilized life; and stating at the same time the impossibility of inducing the Nation at large to embrace those measures; therefore requesting for themselves that their Country should be divided including all the <del type="overstrike">water the</del> waters of the <name type="place">Highwassee River</name> to the upper Towns, that by drawing their society within small limits they proposed to begin the establishment of fixed laws, and regular Government

               </choice> but express the pleasure it affords me to find that the measures taken by your Father the President, for affecting your civilization is the same in principal which you proposed yourselves, you asked about One fourth part of your whole territory <add place="supralinear">to be laid off for you</add> and the President now asks each <name type="person">Cherokee</name> family to hold in reservation 640  acres: I repeat it again that I am happy to find that a perfect agreement exists with the rulers of both Nations</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="ch060f.small.jpg"/>
            <p>As to the best means to be used for your advancement  into a state of civilized life; namely by lessening your territorial claims; which will necessarily attract your attention from the <unclear>Gun</unclear> and the  <unclear/>; and render the farmers life your indispensable pursuit.</p>
            <p>With regard to the Deputies from the lower Towns, they asked their Fathers permission to form a settlement on the west of the <name type="place"> 
                  <reg>River</reg> Mississippi</name> and adduced as reasons.  1st That they chose to continue  the hunters life and secondly they complained of the great Scarcity of Game in the Country in which they then lived.</p>
            <p>Now friends and Brothers I wish you to listen, while I call your attention to a short consideration, of those applications made by the two Deputations to <name type="person">Mr. Jefferson</name> as it was from them; the late treaty Originated, and in fact from them, has sprung the present situation, and state of your national affairs.</p>
            <p>I earnestly hope that all former displeasure respecting an exchange of Countries will<pb n="7" facs="ch060g.small.jpg"/>Be forgotten by all parties; and on the part of the <name type="place">United States</name> your Father the President, in his speech to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> Delegation Stated, that it would be better for his Red, and white Children.  that the <name type="person">Cherokees</name> should move west of the <name type="place">Mississippi</name> by which removal he added, that we should be kept more apart; and consequently less liable to quarrels and Bloodshed; which seem to be daily increasing, and threatening the well disposed of both Nations.
                  </p>
            <p>Friends and Brothers, I beg leave <del type="overstrike">again</del> to call your attention to the propositions; made by both your parties, to <name type="person">Mr. Jefferson</name> the then President of the <name type="place">United States</name>, in order to show to you as clearly as I can that there does not exist, nor ever did exist sufficient cause to excite the smallest degree of hatred or jealousy between those who are the friends to an exchange of Countries, and those who are of a different opinion; for it must be remembered that the Deputies from the upper Towns expressed in the Strongest and most feeling terms, their anxious desire to begin<pb n="8" facs="ch060h.small.jpg"/>The establishment of fixed laws, and regular Government; to which the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> people could not or ever did Object.  As to your Father <name type="person">Mr. Jefferson</name> then President; your proposals were so <choice>

               </choice> in accordance with his best wishes for your future happiness; that every aid and Fatherly assistance has been given to you in the most beneficial manner.
                  </p>
            <p>And with regard to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> people, they are prosecuting the very plan which they sought for and asked <name type="person">Mr. Jefferson</name> to confer on them; they have found the land of promise, and it has been laid off for them; by Solemn Treaty; and your Father the President now holds out a general invitation to all your Nation who chose to migrate, and adds his Fatherly promise that he will act generously with you and make you prosperous and happy in your new homes in the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> Country; and that he will do justice to those who chose to remain here.  Thus stands the situation of both parties, as well defined, as my Judgement, and the narrow<pb n="9" facs="ch060i.small.jpg"/>limits of this talk will afford; and I <choice>

            <p>I am instructed to inform you that the views of the General Government are to bring about by fair and honorable means as soon as practicable an entire extinguishment of the titles to the lands held by the four Nations east of the <name type="place">

The <name type="place">United States</name>, from which you and I claim protection have in consequence of their growing prosperity became subjects of malice and hatred of some of the rulers of <name type="place">Europe</name>, which necessarily imposes on the rulers of the American people the necessity of placing the whole Country in the best possible State of Defence to effect this ground national Object so far as relates to the parts of <name type="place">New Orleans</name>

            <p>For myself I have no hesitations in declaring to this council, and all Others who are now assembled; that from the information, I have Obtained relative to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> Country; there can be no doubt as to the propriety of recommending a removal from this to that Country, and particularly when addressing those who prefer the hunters life.

If I did not feel conscious, that these Statements were founded in truth I Should Shrink from their recital, nor would, I use, the least exertions, to effect an exchange of Countries, with my red Brothers, the <name type="person">Cherokees</name>; But nothing is more clear to me, than that the future prosperity, of the Hunter, the Farmer, Trader, and those engaged in raising Stock, will be essentially promoted, by a removal to the west of the <name type="place">

In answering this Objection I must call your attention to the consideration of a part of the Presidents Speech to the <name type="place">Arkansas</name> Delegation <pb n="16" facs="ch060p.small.jpg"/>Which gives you a new Guarantee for your future happiness: and unless you are prepared to say that his talks pass by you as wind, without <choice>
