               <note type="summary" anchored="true">Copy of a memorandum dated November 9, 1838 from General Winfield Scott, commander of the Cherokee removal, concerning a possible discrepancy between the number of Cherokees on muster rolls and those actually removed. Scott was informed by the Cherokee authorities that 12,608 people in twelve detachments emigrated west by land, but only 11,721 were counted. He intends to make compensation if investigation proves this true.</note>

               </choice> which muster rolls make the whole number emigrated, by <hi> land,</hi> under the arrangement entered into with me, 11721 souls.  But the <name type="person">Cherokee</name> authorities, a party to that agreement, allege, that after several of the muster rolls were closed, many additional families and Individuals joined the detachments in <date when="--03">March</date> increasing the twelve detachments emigrated, <hi>by land,</hi> to the aggregate of 12608 emigrants  making a difference of 887 Souls.  Should this be found to be correct when the said land detachments shall be finally mustered West, an additional requisition may be made by the <name type="person">Cherokee</name> authorities for the excess of individuals, whatever the number, over and above the number of 11721.  Who have been in this Country mustered in the twelve detachments which are now on the road.</p>
