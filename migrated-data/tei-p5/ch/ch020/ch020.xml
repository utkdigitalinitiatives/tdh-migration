               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter from a delegation of Cherokee leaders including John Ross, George Lowrey, Major Ridge, and Elijah Hicks, to Colonel Thomas L. McKenney, in the Department of War, dated May 24, 1824.  The  delegation complains to McKenney about the payment of claims of the Cherokees against white intruders who have stolen and/or damaged Cherokee property.  They indicate their dissatisfaction with the response of the U.S. agent, Joseph McMinn, to these claims and insist that the issue be addressed by the War Department.</note>
