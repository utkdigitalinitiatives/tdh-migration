McKenney, commissioner of Indian Affairs, dated February 15, 1838.  Ross expresses his gratitude for the kind sentiments offered by McKenney on the deteriorating state of affairs in the Cherokee Nation.  Ross refers to the Cherokees as powerless and indicates that the sympathy of the U.S. government is their only hope for relief.</note>
