               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter from John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, to Colonel William Y. Hansell and Colonel Samuel Rockwell, lawyers for the Cherokee Nation, dated July 9, 1835.  Ross complains to the two attorneys regarding the controversy of the payment of the Cherokee annuity.  A vote is to be held under the direction of Major Benjamin F. Currey to determine to which Cherokee faction, the Ridge party or the Ross party, the annuity is to be paid.  Ross complains about slanderous depictions of him in local newspapers and also mentions the arrival of Reverend John F. Schermerhorn to submit treaty proposals to the Cherokees.</note>
