               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a copy of a letter from Colonel Joseph Martin, at Chotee, to Richard Caswell, Governor of North Carolina (1776-1780, 1784-1787), dated September 19, 1785.  Martin reports that he has assumed the duties of Indian agent (to the Cherokees) and has a considerably difficult summer due to frequent encroachments by inhabitants of the state of Franklin, as well as meddlesome talks from the Spaniards and the western Indians.  He mentions the former British agent, Mr. McDonald and his relationship with the Chickamauga Cherokees, Alexander McGillivray, and the Creeks.</note>
