               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from John Martin and John Ridge, Cherokee leaders in Washington, to John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, dated December 28, 1831.  Martin and Ridge report to Ross on the progress of the Cherokee delegation in Washington and their decision to delay the delivery of the Cherokee Memorial to Congress.  They indicate that they have news of atrocities against the Cherokees in Georgia.  They further inform Ross that Elias Boudinot and John Ridge have met with Henry Clay who has pledged his support.  They lament the hypocrisy with which they are met in dealing with the U.S. government.  In addition, Martin and Ridge make reference to a delegation of Creek leaders also in Washington and comment on William Wirt's involvement in the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia.</note>

            <p>In this stage of the business of our Nation, it will be of course  not proper to conjecture <del type="overstrike"> but</del> the probable results of our application before Congress.

Honorably have we struggled so far in the difficulties,  it should be our greatest desire to proceed in the path of honor,  to our future generations have names of which they shall not be ashamed.</p>
            <p>The destiny of our nation, exposed as it is to the storms of political ambition,  the zeal of our adversaries, causes the deepest feelings of concern in the breast of every Indian who loves his Country.  But in the midst of our hills, we enjoy the consolation to know, that the best portion of the population <add place="supralinear">of the</add>
               <name type="place">U.S.</name> sympathizes with us,  are becoming awakened to a sense of the injustice practiced towards our people.  It remains to be <del type="overstrike">en</del> seen, whether there is sufficient virtue among the white people to counteract the acts of their vicious population.  If they achieve this, they may <unclear>count</unclear>
               <pb n="4" facs="ch012d.small.jpg"/>on the permanency of their hesitations: if they fail they will haste to the time when their existence as a prosperous nation, will vanish away, like the baseless fabric of a vision.
