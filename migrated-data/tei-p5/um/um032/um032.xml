I believe that is the best way after all to take it time about, but I will write you this one as I want you to send me some things by Aunt Narcissa. I wish that you would get me a Purple <choice>

You see that I have been so used to going to you to show me that it goes harder with me. But I expect that I will learn how to shift for myself by &amp; by.
