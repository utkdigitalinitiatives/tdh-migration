I will leave here in a day or two for the City of <name type="place">New York</name> where I shall remain a day or two or three, and then for home only to stay long enough to say howdy and off again to <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, again to contend with yellow fever and Cholera.

                  </choice> Taylor</name> does not give satisfaction to his Whig friends he does not make removals enough or rather he will not sanction any removals and hence the office seekers are wonderfully disappointed, many  have left the city grumbling and vowing they will have revenge, others still hang on in hopes that a change will soon take place. I cannot say what will be the result in the end. The president certainly possesses the quality of keeping his own counsel to perfection, up to this time none but his most intimate <pb n="4" facs="um014d.small.jpg"/> friends know what <del type="overstrike">is</del> his course is to be. It is true that many of his appointments so far have had a singular cast, but that argues more for the Generals want of political knowledge than any thing else. </p>
            <p>I must refer you to the papers for the particulars of what is going on here, and do not put too much faith in Old man <name type="person">Ritchie</name> he is decidedly too much prejudiced against the Whigs to do them justice. I believe the <name type="place">Baltimore</name> "Sun" and the <name type="place">New York</name> "Herald" are the best papers as far as the news is concerned we have, and I shall myself take one of them on that account, probably the "Sun."</p>
