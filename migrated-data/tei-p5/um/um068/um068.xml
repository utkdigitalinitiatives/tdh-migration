               </choice> arrived here yesterday. It was very kind in your sending me that money. I gave it to <name type="person">Mr. Smith</name>, he seemed very much pleased and said that it  was a very liberal subscription. I told him that $1 ½ was for the Paper.</p>
            <p>The examination is just over. It continued three days there <del type="overstrike">there</del> were not many people the first day ⁁ <add place="supralinear">on account of the weather</add> but the ⁁ <add place="supralinear">third</add> day the house was crowded. I missed but one question the whole time, and I do not think that I should have missed that one had I not been so much frightened. <name type="person">Mr Walkers</name> family came every day. <name type="person">Cousin Sam</name> said that he intended to write to you immediately after it was over. So I expect that you will receive his letter before you do mine. The <name type="person">

            <p>Father you requested me in your last letter not to write so many letters. I will discontinue all my letters to every person with the exception of our family. I was very much distressed when I read that part of your letter. I did not think that I had ever written any thing that I would not be willing for any person <pb n="2" facs="um068b.small.jpg"/> to read. I am very glad that you have told not to write. I will do any thing that I think would please you and Mama I know the reason that you did not speak of it when you were here. You did not like to speak of any thing that you thought would give me pain.</p>
            <p>I do not think that I can graduate this Summer. I wish that you would write to Mr. Smith about it. <choice>
