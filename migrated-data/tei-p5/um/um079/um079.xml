            <p>It is now only two weeks until I see you, then Oh how very happy I expect to be. But it does not seem possible that I should go home again because I have been so long from you all to tell you the truth Mama when I left home I thought that I never would return. O! Mama you do not know how happy I feel whenever I think about home.  Tell Aunt and brother that I am looking very anxiously for them, I have just received a letter from <name type="person">Cousin Dick</name> saying that I expect them on Friday week, but that will be one day too late for the Examination as <name type="person">Bishop Otey</name>  has persuaded <name type="person">Mr Smith</name> to have three days examination instead of two — it will commence on <emph>that</emph> day (Friday week) and continue until Wednesday; so you see that will give us so much more time so display our knowledge.  Please write me any how one more letter <choice>
