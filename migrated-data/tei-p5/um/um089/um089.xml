            <p>It has been so long since I wrote you, that I really feel fearful, I shall not
                    easily obtain forgiveness But the Examination is approaching very rapidly, and I
                    am obliged to apply more of my <emph>precious</emph> time to my studies. I am in
                    hopes that by very close application, I can graduate this Summer. I wish that
                    you would write to <name type="person">Mr. Smith</name> upon the subject, but
                    not mention that I have said any thing to you about it. I have a great many
                    studies every hour in the day I am busy. I practice on the Piano and Guitar two
                    hours after school is dismissed.</p>
            <p>I intend teaching Sister <name type="person">Martha</name> French when I return,
                    I am sure she will be pleased with it. I <choice>

               </name> had some idea of visiting <name type="place">Nashville</name> &amp; Columbia this next month. Oh! I know it would be
                    very pleasant as well to herself as to me. Tell Brother <name type="person">John</name> that he has no idea how <emph>very</emph> much pleasure his
                    very kind letter afforded me, indeed I thought it <emph>very</emph> generous in
                    him to send me half of <pb n="2" facs="um089b.small.jpg"/> money. I was truly pleased to hear that he
                    was enough of a Man to do business. Now that the "ice is broken", I hope he will
                    write me often. I was surprised to hear that <name type="person">Rachel
                        Trigg</name> had not received a letter from me, for immediately after the
                    reception of her's, I answered it but sent it to the Post Office by a little
                    boy, &amp; I suppose it must have been misplaced in some way, the next leisure
                    moment that I have I shall write her again.</p>
            <p>I have a request to make, The first opportunity that offers itself, I wish you to
                    send my <emph>Riding dress</emph> — You will find it in Sister's Wardrobe

                    astonish you to see how well I sew I make all my dresses, — but it is not
                    proper to praise myself. The <emph>Time</emph> flies swiftly, only two months
                    before I shall be with you. Oh! I do wish to see you all very much. Kiss the
                        <emph>dear, dear</emph> children &amp; give my love to <emph>all,
