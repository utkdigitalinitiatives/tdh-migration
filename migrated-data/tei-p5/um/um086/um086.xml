            <p>Again I am disappointed in not seeing you, indeed I had expected you with so much certainty that I could scarcely reconcile myself to the idea of your not coming and have determined not look for you until I see you, which I hope will be in June. <name type="person">Cousin Sam</name> let me read your letter, that he received last week he laughed at me very much about the <emph>kiss</emph> that you sent or at least in trying to get it.</p>
            <p>The Examination commenced on yesterday morning which was Friday &amp; will continue until Tuesday evening today and tomorrow omitted of course. The lower classes only, were examined yesterday. The more advanced are reserved for the two last days. I think that I am very well prepared I have two very pretty <choice>

I am very anxious to take Guitar lessons, by taking one lesson on the Piano and two on the Guitar in a week, will have to pay exactly the same price as if I were to take whole lessons on the piano, and I think that I should learn equally as much. If it is not perfectly agreeable to you, I should rather not commence. They sell very cheap. <name type="person">Mr Smith</name> has very handsome ones for $25. You must excuse my short letters until after this Examination is over, then I intend writing you very long ones.
