            <p>As it is Sunday and as the weather is too disagreeable for us to go to church. I think that I could not find a more pleasant than writing to my dear Mama &amp; Papa. I know that you will think that it is not right for me to write on Sunday, but I want my letter to arrive there on Christmas day. You have no idea how much pleasure it would give me to receive one on that day. This letter I know will not find Papa at home. but I have not written to him for so long a time. that I am afraid that he will not like it. I have commenced looking for Papa up to see me. I wish that he would make haste and come. I am so very impatient to see him. Mama how do you intend spending your Christmas? I know that you will all be so happy. I do wish that I was at home. If I was I should be the happiest creature living. By ⁁ <add place="supralinear">the</add> next Christmas I expect I shall be at our happy home. I always <choice>

If you know how happy it make me to receive letter I know that you would write often You must forgive me for being so extravagant in my wishes for letters, for I do love to receive them so much. I commenced this letter with the determination that I would not ask for any letters but I had wrote for some before I thought of myself. Excuse my short letter. Give my love to all my relations. Kiss the children.</p>
