               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>The letter written by <name type="person">Veny</name> with your Post script, although written on  the <date when="1838-04-21">21st of April</date> did not reach me till the <date when="1838-04-29">29th</date>
            </p>
            <p>I should have written to you as soon as I got the letter, but we heard from <name type="person">Henry Taylor</name> that you were to be over this week, and we have been looking for you.</p>
            <p>I am very much obliged to you for the money which you propose to loan me. With that I can easily pay the balance on the land.</p>
            <p>If the roads and water will permit, we will probably be over next week. <name type="person">Julia</name> is anxious to see you all, and I can probably spare the horses better next week that at any other time <unclear>I race</unclear>
            </p>
            <p>We may not be able to Come, but I think it probable we shall. Julia's health is about the Same, perhaps a little better. The rest are well. We had heard nothing of <name type="person">Bettie's</name> marrying notions, until Veny's letter came, which was the day after the wedding</p>
            <p>Tell Veny that <name type="person">Jane Claiborne</name> and <name type="person">Henry Johnson</name> (brother of <name type="person">Bob</name>) were married Thursday. The <name type="person">Johnsons</name> were opposed to it.</p>
            <p>Tell her also that her old <name type="person">Aunt Lucy Green</name>
               <pb n="2" facs="um035b.small.jpg"/> died at <name type="place">Jackson</name> last Wednesday. Veny's mother is in town now, and will stay at our house tonight. The family are well. Tell her we will bring her dress, or send it sooner if we can.</p>
            <p>I had no Cotton up for the frost to injure. Some was sprouting a little, but I do not think it is hurt much. Julia's garden was considerably injured. I expect Jane's first Cotton was ruined. The friends over here are generally well. <name type="person">Jack Taylor's</name> oldest daughter has been very sick but is getting well. Henry's youngest child has also been sick.</p>
            <p>We will try to get over next week</p>
