            <p>You wrote to me that you had received only one letter from me since I arrived here; but this will be the fourth that I have written. I wrote an answer to my sister's on last Wednesday. O! I was so much pleased to receive a letter from her, and it was written so well I wish that I could receive one from brother <name type="person">John</name>. O! I was so very happy to hear that <name type="person">Aunt Narcissa</name> is coming up. I hope that she will not get out of the notion; for if she does I shall be so much disappointed. I shall look for her on Thursday; I wish that you both would come up with her. I had commenced school before I received your last letter. I have been enjoying very health ever since I commenced school.</p>
