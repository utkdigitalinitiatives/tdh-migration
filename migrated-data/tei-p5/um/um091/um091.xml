            <p>This is Tuesday, the day that I promised to write, but I fear that I shall not be able to make any letter <emph>very</emph> interesting to you.</p>
            <p>The Children are all well at present, and have been so with the exception of <name type="person">Sam</name>, he had two or three Chills. we broke them upon him by the aid of Quinine and <emph>his drain</emph>, he is entirely recovered now, and speaks very often about you, when any one troubles him, he threatens to <emph>tell his papa</emph>. <name type="person">King</name>, as usual cries at night and will sleep with me.  The other boys are very busy preparing for their Examination.  I think will acquit themselves <choice>

               </choice> well, I believe it takes place on next Monday.  I wish very much that you could here at that time.</p>

Your Son <name type="person">John</name> forms one of the number, his Uncle Sam and Cousin <name type="person">Will</name> insisted very much upon it. <pb n="2" facs="um091b.small.jpg"/> It is generally understood that their object is to benefit neither the democrat of Whig party but I have my suspicions on the subject.  There is to be a "<emph>grand Ball</emph>"  on the fourth of July, given to this Military Company.  Uncle Sam is one of the subscribers, indeed I expect it will be quite a <emph>grand affair</emph>, that is, if they can get good Music — <name type="person">Aunt McLillan</name> , passed through the other day on her way to the <name type="place">Gibson Wells</name>, she remained with us only, for breakfast but said she would return in about a week — There has been a <emph>well</emph>, near <name type="place">

               </choice> you think <emph>Jackson's improving</emph>? Cousin <name type="person">Jane</name> is to give a <emph>small</emph> Tea Party tomorrow evening.  I can assure you I feel quite delighted at the idea, for this place is rather dull —.  Our Trip to <name type="place">Nashville</name> is entirely given out, I feel rather rejoiced that otherwise, for it would not be pleasant travelling in such warm weather.  Uncle Will has heard very distressing news about his plantation, that almost the whole of it, is overflowed, Cousin is undecided whether he will go down or not — <name type="person">Mr. Hinds</name> expects to leave of thursday.  I believe Cousin Jane's Party is given to him.</p>
            <p>I suppose ere this, you have arrived at Jonesboro — if so, give our best love to Grand Mama, <name type="person">Aunt Kate</name> &amp; all of our Relations.  I can imagine your joy at being, again at your old Home.</p>
            <p>We received the two letters you wrote. Our Friend <name type="person">Bill <pb n="3" facs="um091c.small.jpg"/> Jones</name> has called to see us two or three times.  the <emph>large stage</emph> House that he took away with him did not suit.  he was <emph>too poor</emph> — his Father has not yet called.</p>
            <p>The Democrats still appear to be in fine spirits about the election  they speak of giving a large brand dance down at the "big  Spring" on the 18th of July — I think that is one of Uncle Will's propositions.  I believe I have told you of everything that has taken place since you left.  We are all anxious to hear from you, Write to us often.  The Children send their love to you.   <name type="person">Aunt Butter's</name>  family are all well — they send their love to you —</p>
