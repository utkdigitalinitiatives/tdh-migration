               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter written by C. Clay Balfrey  to Edward E. Porter on November 11, 1850. In the letter, Balfrey mentions the fact that many people have been getting married and that marriage seems to be the popular thing to do at the time. He also mentions that Edward's former landlord, a man named Nick Simmons, was shot in the back in a fight and has recovered. He concludes by saying that he wishes for Edward and himself to renew their friendship after some previous disagreements.</note>

            <p>Your Old Landlord <name type="person">Nick Simmons</name> received a bullet in his back a short time since which came very near sending him to <name type="person">Davy Jones</name>.

               </choice> was tried and acquitted, owing to the great prejudice against your Land Lord and the eloquence of <name type="person">Mr. Thompson</name>.</p>

               </choice> of the inconstancy of a certain daughter of the South." very true, and you think I ought to have told you of it sooner. well perhaps I ought, and it was my intention to do so at first, but upon <unclear>maturer</unclear> consideration I saw no <emph>necessity</emph> for it, and as I always felt the greatest delicacy in saying anything to you upon that subject I concluded to spare myself the pain of making the communication, knowing that you would soon find it out by other means, I am obliged to you for your <pb n="4" facs="um060d.small.jpg"/> sympathy, but find your "philosophic conclusion" to be but poor consolation, and think an individual must be of a cold passionless nature who can <emph>fully adopt</emph> the sentiment <unclear>enfavdid</unclear> in your <unclear>prevent</unclear>.

                  <reg>disposed</reg>
               </choice> to treat the affair, I can only say that it may be fun for you but it is death to me.</p>
            <p>You might make the bet which you propose, via: "that I will not fall in love soon with a child of 16." with the greatest certainty of winning, for I think it is reduced to a <choice>

                  <reg>loving</reg>
               </choice>, 16 years of age would never make the slightest difference with me, for it is my private opinion that if impressions made at the age of 16 do not continue, they will not at any subsequent age. Nor can I see any thing "ludicrous" in the business. I have reviewed my own conduct in this affair frequently, and have acted with <unclear>circuns friction,</unclear> throughout and I must ‚ÅÅ <add place="supralinear">say</add> however <choice>

               </choice> it may be, that I have nothing to reproach myself with from the beginning, this I speak with a clear conscience, and I believe I am conscientious at time.</p>
            <p>I am extremely glad that you have referred to this matter, for I see it is likely to restore a perfect understanding between us, which to me is very desirable. From the beginning of this unfortunate affair all that I could ever see or hear of your actions or sayings induced me to believe that you did oppose it, and would oppose it to the last. This I thought was severe. If you with whom I had lived more than a year on terms of intimacy and friendship should  condemn and oppose the consummation of my wishes what was I to expect from them who were even more interested and less acquainted with me. Cherishing these sentiments I felt a coldness toward you and could not nor would not have acted otherwise than in accordance with my feelings. But your assurance that you have never done anything to injure me settles this matter to my joyful satisfaction. And now I hope that all feelings of friendship that may have at any previous time existed may be renewed, strengthened, doubled or whatever else you chose. I <unclear>chalod</unclear>
