            </opener>
            <p>As there is no church in Town to day, I think that I could not better employ my time, than by answering your very kind letter.  I can assure you that it was received with great pleasure, as your letters always are, but I must confess this last with more than usual, I was also a little astonished for I had began to suspect that you all thought it of no consequence whether I heard from home or not; I am very glad to see that I was mistaken but you must remember that you promised to write me at least once in two weeks. and Papa always tell me something about the dear Children, for I am almost <emph>distracted</emph> to see them.  I awake very often in the night under the impression that I am at home and that little <name type="person">Sam</name> is with me â€”  I hope that you keep <name type="person">Emelina</name> at her <emph>knitting</emph>.  I am fearful that the children will not be so well <emph>fixed</emph> this winder as they have always been before.  I promise myself to be more useful when I return.</p>
            <p>Indeed I am grieved to hear that <name type="person">Olivia Day</name> has acted so very badly, how mortifying it must be to her Parents but I think that they are almost as much to blame as she is herself for they <pb n="2" facs="um081b.small.jpg"/> have never given her any of the advantages of Education, and I suppose no good advice, (such as I receive from you upon that subject.) she has not displayed her good taste in selecting <name type="person">Mr McRee</name> for I think that he is the last person that any one could fancy. Poor girl! I am afraid that she will "have her reward."</p>
            <p>I attended a small party at <name type="person">Mr. Wormleys</name>  on Friday evening and enjoyed myself very much, indeed I never was at a more pleasant Party.  I was also invited to join a Pic-nic on saturday but owing to the days being so unfavorable it was given out.  I felt a little disappointed for I know it would have been pleasant.  We intended spending the day about two miles from Town at the <name type="place">Sulphur Springs</name> , a very pretty place it is I am told. Papa I know that this does not interest you but I do not know what else to write about.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person">Mr. Smith</name> has requested each one of the girls to write home, and see if it is their parents wish that they should take Drawing lessons, but I think that I have as many studies as I can possibly attend to.  he expects a Tutoress on in a few days, who will teach nothing but drawing painting &amp; Embroidery.  Mr. Smith placed me in a much higher class in French than I anticipated, for which you may be sure I felt pleased. I intend to try and keep up with it.  You know that I never studied French but part of one Session before. <name type="person">Miss Lizzy</name> (my Tutoress) says that she thinks that I will make a very good Scholar.</p>
            <p>Dear Papa think that it is almost time for you to <choice>
                  <orig>fulfil</orig>
                  <reg>fulfill</reg>
               </choice> your <emph>Promise</emph> which that you would come up to see me, I do hope that I shall not be disappointed.  Tell Aunts<name type="person"> Patsy</name> and <name type="person">Narcissa</name>  that I am looking very anxiously for an answer to my letter, <name type="person">Cousin Jane</name> and <name type="person">Aunt Frances</name> that I should be delighted to receive a letter from them.  I hope that you yourself will not be so <emph>tardy</emph> in <pb n="3" facs="um081c.small.jpg"/> writing again.  Give my love to all.</p>
