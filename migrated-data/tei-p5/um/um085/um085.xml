            <p>Since I received your kind letter, I have experienced great uneasiness concerning my dear little Brother, indeed I have been tempted once or twice to beg you to let me return home; but after some consideration concluded that it would be ‚ÅÅ <add place="supralinear">better</add> for me to remain.</p>
            <p>My school duties are <emph>very</emph> numerous, and pressing at present, the Examination being so near. I do not think it right that I should permit a minute of my time to be unoccupied.  I completed my Composition, and carried it to the Tutoress this morning so that it could be <choice>

               </choice> by her.  Although this is saturday, we attended school as on any other day, &amp; will continue doing so until the dreaded time is over.  I am extremely anxious that you should be here at that time.  <name type="person">Mr. Smith</name> has inquired several times of me if you <pb n="2" facs="um085b.small.jpg"/>  intended coming. I always replied that I thought you did.  The Examination will be in the last week in this month continue three days.  If you can <emph>possibly</emph> make it convenient <emph>do come</emph>.</p>
            <p>I hope you will excuse this very short letter, as you know the cause.  I must conclude with saying, how much I want to see you <emph>all</emph>.  Kiss the sweet children and give my love to all my dear relations.</p>
