            <p>Circumstances standing a <emph>little </emph> in the way have prevented my writing to you at as an early a date as I contemplated; but I will now take time to inform you that I arrived safely at my Brothers in <name type="place">Kemper County</name> on the 7th <choice>

               </choice> On my way down, and since my arrival I have made upon the subject of our conversation before I left <name type="place">Raleigh</name>. My opinion, from the best information <choice>

                  <expan>received</expan>
               </choice> is that you will do well by occupying the stand at <name type="place">Aberdeen</name> at as early a date as you possibly can. It is the most eligible point= and commands a more extensive fertile section of country than any other I have heard spoken of, unless it be <name type="place">Gainsville </name>some distance below. The latter place had the advantages of being more central and accessible. They are both cut-off in a measure, from a winter intercourse with the <choice>

               <add place="supralinear">by the prairies,</add> a season of the the year too the most important for the advantage of your business. It would be a spur and spring to the business which I think would never subside, and would add incalculably to its profits, were you to occupy one of those stands this fall. I would earnestly advise, if possible, to forego some of your already conceived plans, and strain a point to do so. The farming interest of the country is just now in the stage of incipiency, and presents the fairest opportunity that it ever will for you to lay fast hold of it. I would suggest that you send <name type="person">Mr Charr</name> if you have no one to spare from your own shop to put in one of those places. I would <pb n="3" facs="um043c.small.jpg"/> I believe prefer Gainsville from one consideration. A railroad from that place will in all probability be constructed across the prairies sometime in the course of next year; And it is destined to become a place of some importance.â€”</p>
            <p>I have myself gone into business with my brother in merchandizing. I bought out his former partners interest, at cost and six <choice>

               </choice> time. And I am here now on a purchase of Articles that we need to replenish the stock, which we are now obliged to do in consequence of this former partner's having failed to go to <name type="place">Mobile </name>according to promise. We get goods from overstocked merchants in this place at <name type="place">New York</name> cost  and twenty <choice>

            <p> As I am in haste I must be brief. Give the above information to any friend or <emph>interested</emph> person who may inquire after me. I think at this time that it may be possible for me to be in <name type="place">Raleigh</name> about the first of <choice>

Keep what things you have of mine yet on hand that were contained in the box. They are movable, and worth more to me now I have a prospect of being settled than I can probably get for them. I should be very glad to hear from you and any farther information in my power to communicate upon notice will be cheerfully given.</p>
