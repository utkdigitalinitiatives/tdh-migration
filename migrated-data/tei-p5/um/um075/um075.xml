            <p>I fear that you feel uneasy about my health. I reproach myself for writing you that I had been sick, for I only had three Chills and as "fortune would have it" I missed yesterday, I took my last dose of Quinine this morning so says <name type="person">Mrs Smith</name>.

(I believe it was his funeral, or at least something about him) It was the best sermon that I have heard since I have been Columbia, but I being quite weak slept most of the time, but I have no doubt that you will say that it was very wrong for me to do so.</p>

I declare I am almost distracted to see you and all, I do not wish to remain in Columbia one day after the Examination unless it is the pleasure of the one that comes after me, for I have taken a dislike to the place that I fear I never shall get over.</p>

            <p>I went to see her a week or two since she looks very badly indeed, her health is so bad that neither  <name type="person">Cousin Jane</name> nor <name type="person">Mary Eliza</name> could come to see me whilst I sick. But Mrs Smith was so very kind to me that I did not mind their neglect. (For neglect I must call it so none of the Family came or Sent to see how I was the whole time.)</p>
            <p>Has <name type="person">Aunt Narcissa</name> received my letter yet. If she has tell her she must answer it very soon. I cannot give her much praise for her regularity in writing to me, and as for <name type="person">Aunt <choice>

               </choice> to be discontinued so soon. You remember that <name type="person">Cousin Jane Rawlings</name> wrote me one letter, well, that is the only one that I have ever received from her. And the ⁁ <add place="supralinear">same</add> way with <name type="person">Aunt France</name>. I suppose that Sister and <name type="person">Mary Hays</name> have "fine times" together. O! how much I wish to be at home to see them. Tell <name type="person">Mary Ormand</name> that I have never received the letter that she said she was going to write me. I expect that she can almost write sure enough, for she is so smart about every thing that she undertakes. I should like to see her and King walking hand in hand for they both do look so very sweet. I received a letter from <name type="person">Eliza Bigelow</name> saying that <name type="person">Bet Hale</name>, and <name type="person">Lizzy McNeil</name>, were expected to be in <name type="place">Jackson</name> this Month. I was very glad to hear it for I want to see Bet very much indeed. I have only Six more weeks to stay here then I expect to be so <emph>very very</emph> happy. I forgot to mention something about the Whig girls, this morning all of them said that they intended fasting (as it is the day that <name type="person">Tyler</name> said that all good Whigs must fast) well, at breakfast the majority of them did very well, but being very hungry and tired when they came from <pb n="3" facs="um075c.small.jpg"/> Church they (all but one or two) concluded that it would do Harrison no good to fast, so they eat their dinners. there was a very good joke for us Democrats. When we were going to Breakfast <name type="person">Caroline Shelby</name> a good Democrat said to me "Eat more than ever you did in your life." and I did too.</p>
            <p>I was very much amused at the girls that were sick when I was There were two who imagined themselves very sick, but no one thought so. they thought that their Parents ought to know about them, so they got things for writing and wrote a very long and mournful letter and gave it to Mrs Smith to read. She read it out to us girls, and of all the letter I ever that I ever did read that beat. In one of them was if <emph>"Life last?"</emph> I shall see you in six weeks with other very mournful things.. Indeed I do think that it will be very sickly here this Summer For the Nursery has not been without some one in it for a great length of time.</p>
            <p>You wished to know how I came to get so <del type="overstrike">wrong</del> bad a Record. Indeed I do not know how I got it for ⁁ <add place="supralinear">I</add> had been trying to get a good one I do know what the 5 in Deportment was for, I went rather to far down in the yard. I am trying very hard to get a perfect one next time. but it is uncertain wether I shall succe ⁁ <add place="supralinear">e</add> d You do not know how hard it is to get a good.
