The letter is composed of two entries. The first entry discusses Mary Jane's birthday, family events, and the political climate in Jackson, Tennessee. The second entry, dated November 26, discusses a fire at the Institute where Mary Jane attends and alludes to possible unrest with their slaves if future president William Henry Harrison does not free them. The letter has written on it that Elizabeth Chester died twelve months after writing this letter.</note>
