               <note type="summary">This document is a letter from A.J. Donalson to
				R.E.W. Earl dated May 6, 1821. In the letter, Donalson speaks of the
				hospitality of the citizens of New Orleans toward himself and his troops while
				they have been there. Donalson awaits information from Colonel Forbes on
				whether or not he has reached Pensacola, carrying orders to Cuba for the
				surrender of Florida to the United States. He states that after the information
				is attained, he will march to Pensacola as well and that troops will soon take
				possession of St. Augustine. Donalson states that people are moving from all
				parts of the country to Pensacola and that it has the potential to become a
				great commercial city. He concludes by asking R.E.W. Earl to finish the
				portrait of Donalson that he started and present it to his mother when it is
				completed.</note>
