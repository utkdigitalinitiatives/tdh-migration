				1844, by George L. Welker to his brother James M. Welker in Knoxville,
				Tennessee. George L. Welker writes that James K. Polk had just been nominated
				by the Democrats to run for President. He also explains that he received the
				news immediately because of a new electromagnetic telegraph that transferred
				the information from Baltimore to Washington in less than a second.</note>
