            </opener>
            <p>I am duly aware of the impropriety in general of troubling you upon subjects not connected with your public duties; but in cases where justice to individuals requires it, I rely confidently that you will not withhold <choice>
                  <orig>any thing</orig>
                  <reg>anything</reg>
               </choice> within your knowledge, which may prevent injustice.  I therefore take the liberty of making the following enquiries of you.</p>
            <p>1st Whether you were not intimately acquainted with my conduct in relation to the great questions of <emph>Nullification</emph> and <emph>Secession</emph> during the whole of the last Session of congress?</p>
            <p>2d.  Whether you had not full opportunities, not only of knowing my conduct, but also my private feelings on these subjects?</p>
            <p>3d.  Whether any member of congress, <choice>
                  <orig>laboured</orig>
                  <reg>labored</reg>
               </choice> with more zeal and assiduity to put down the doctrines of Nullification and Secession than I did?</p>
            <p>4th Whether my whole energies were not directed to sustain the Administration in the great conflict in which it was compelled to engaged on the above subjects?</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Yours with great respect</salute>
