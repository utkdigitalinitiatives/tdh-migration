            <p>Having for some time expected to see or hear from you, I have neglected writing__ Our last shipment was made about the 25th of march, in which I had thirteen, making in all I sent to market on account of the last years business sixty Eight__ Your last letter having left me in doubt as to your longer continuance, it is now also lately necessary for you to advise me positively upon the subject__</p>
            <p>I have commenced upon a new years work, and am purchasing negroes much faster than usual at fair prices, I think from the present prospect, that I shall be able to use all the capital without much difficulty, I have no opposition as yet, but am daily looking for it to come <pb n="2" facs="sc137b.small.jpg"/> I am unable at this time to furnish you any specific account of our profits on the last years business, the most of the negroes that I sent out were likely, &amp; I flatter myself brought a fair profit__ &amp; have heard of no loss or misfortune happening to any of them as yet__ The first year I was engaged with <name>Franklin Lamfield</name>, I had the misfortune to loose two, after they had been sold, <add>they</add> were taken sick, returned as unsound property, &amp; finally died <gap agent="damage"/>
               <unclear>test missing</unclear> I do not mention this however as a drawback, on our last years profits, but merely to show you that such was the fact, of which I have no recollection at this time, of acquainting you with before__ By judicious management the business is worth following, and I flatter myself that my hard earned experience, has made me competent to perform <pb n="3" facs="sc137c.small.jpg"/> the duties of my branch of the concern__ If this should find you at home, let me hear from you</p>
