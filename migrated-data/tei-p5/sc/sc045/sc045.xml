               <note type="summary">This document is letter from Andrew Jackson (US
				president, 1829-1837) to Major William B. Lewis dated February 28, 1845. In the
				letter, Andrew Jackson states to Major Lewis his opinions about who he believes
				to be the best men for the Tennessee State Department administration. Jackson
				approves Mr. Clay for the Secretary of State position and Mr. Buchanan into the
				Department of State. He approves of Colonel Polk obtaining a position in the
				administration, but says that Mr. Tyler's succession to the administration
				would split the democracy apart and damage Polk's administration. Jackson
				concludes this letter by informing Major Lewis of his failing health. He
				consequently dies several months later.</note>
