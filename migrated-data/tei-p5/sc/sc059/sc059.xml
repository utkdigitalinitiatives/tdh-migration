I think on your birthday — just before I left <name type="place">Washington</name>. at least, that was always my understanding about the matter. <del type="overstrike">from</del> so of course I have always considered the picture yours, &amp; or not wonder that <add place="supralinear">you</add> did to also — I <choice>
