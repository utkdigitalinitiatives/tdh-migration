				Gardenhire passed in the August 1795 term by the Washington District Superior
				Court of Law. The trial was in regards to the murder of Joseph Hackley in
				Greene County on May 2, 1791. The jurors declared that Gardenhire had indeed
				killed Hackley with the willful intent to murder. The indictment further
				explained the nature of the crime and Hackley's death. It was signed by
				attorney William Cocke, and further instructions on the back of the indictment
				recommended that Gardenhire be taken into custody immediately.</note>
