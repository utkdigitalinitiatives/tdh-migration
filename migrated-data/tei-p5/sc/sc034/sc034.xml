            <p>He was admitted to the Tennessee bar at 
			 <name type="place">Jonesboro</name> and 
			 <name type="place">Greeneville</name>, 
			 <date>1778</date>, and the same year he was

			 <date when="1801">1801</date>
               <name type="person">John Sevier</name> retired from the Gonvernorship

			 the next gubernatorial election Sevier defeated him overwhelmingly in spite of
			 General Jackson's influence. The vote stood, Roane 4,923; Sevier, 6,480. Roane
			 then retired from political life until 
			 <date when="1815">1815</date>, when he was appointed one of
			 the Supreme Judges of the State. This office he held until his death, which
			 occurred in 
			 <date when="1818">1818</date>.</p>
            <p>He is said to have been a highly cultured gentleman, and to have had
			 an aversion to the turmoils of the political life of his day. While he was
			 Governor of Tennessee the State was laid off into three Congressional districts
			 to-wit: 
			 <name type="place">Washington</name>, Hamilton, and 
			 <name type="place">Mero</name>. 
			 <name type="place">Knoxville</name> was the capital of the State.</p>
