               <note type="summary" anchored="true">The following document is a letter, dated April 20, 1844, from Samuel Laughlin to Major W. J. Whitthorne in Shelbyville, Tennessee.  In the letter, Laughlin discusses both national and state politics.  He updates Whitthorne on election results from around the country, and he warns that a fierce battle must be fought to prevail  against the Whigs in upcoming elections.  Laughlin, an ardent supporter of James K. Polk, was also one of the "Immortal Thirteen" who, fearing the election of a Whig, refused to meet with the Tennessee House to elect a representative to the U.S. Senate, leaving Tennessee unrepresented in the Senate for 1841-1843. </note>

In the city, the Native American Democratic ticket has prevailed; but the Whigs are beaten badly, and knowing they would be beaten, many of them abandoned their own regular ticket, and voted for the Native ticket (a branch of the democracy mostly friendly to <name type="person">Tyler</name> and <name type="person">Calhoun</name>) in order to beat the regular locossco ticket.  Of three, our ticket was much the strongest, but the natives and Whigs united, beat us.  The Whigs do not exult in the result—it has shown their weakness.  <name type="person">Harper</name>  the Mayor elect, called a Whig is a Calhoun man—and has been a Tylerite.— In <name type="place">Kentucky</name> , our friends are <add place="left margin">

Four or five good democratic papers have been started lately in that state at proper points — one of them a German paper at <name type="place">Louisville</name> — and the best talents of the state are in the field for us on the electoral ticket and for the legislature.</p>
            <p>In this state the Whigs intend, as we learn here, and one purpose of my writing is to inform you of it, to have a universal, simultaneous rising as soon as they hear from their nominations at <name type="place">Baltimore</name>. Old <unclear>Taul</unclear>, old <name type="person">

When they hear from the convention and know the result, the Whig candidates for Elector, old <name type="person">Barringer</name>, <name type="person">John Bell</name>, and all, will take the field.  We must be prepared to breast the shock and meet them.  Our candidates, and all others who can speak, or strike a stroke, must be on the alert.  I have written to <name type="person">Mr. Rogers</name> of <name type="place">Fayetteville</name>, who will probably be your candidate for Elector, that he must be in readiness to fight; and I have written to the candidate in my own district, and to <name type="person">Mr. H.
