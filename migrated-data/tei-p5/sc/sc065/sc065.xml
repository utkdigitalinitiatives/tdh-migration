               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter written by Charles E. Haven to his wife Annie on January 7, 1844. In the letter, Charles discusses his travels and the conditions under which he is travelling on his way through Tennessee back to Pennsylvania. Charles mentions in his letter that he witnessed an auction in which black slaves and freemen were being sold or bought in the marketplace, and he expresses the opinion that this is one of the worst features about slavery.</note>

I arrived here about 10 O'Clock &amp; then got my breakfast, not having had anything until then but an apple I had in my pocket. So you can form some idea how delightful it is to travel in this country at this season of the year. the cart &amp; the buggy were run instead of stages —  How do you think you would have borne it if you had come along as you wished to. you could not have lived through it, but thank God I have a strong constitution &amp; can bear a great deal of fatigue, but I congratulate myself that I am over the worst part of my journey if the <name type="place">Ohio</name>
