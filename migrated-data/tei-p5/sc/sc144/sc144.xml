               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter dated January 7, 1849 from James Miller to Robert A. Burford.  The letter is a complaint against Buford for misrepresenting the physical status of two slaves he sold to Miller.  The two slaves were said to be sound and healthy; however it was later discovered that one had an eye out and the other suffered from  Phthisic.</note>
