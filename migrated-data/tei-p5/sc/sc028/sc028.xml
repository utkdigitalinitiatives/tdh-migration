               <note type="summary">This document is a letter whose date is unknown,
				written from Sampson Williams to Andrew Jackson when Jackson was a member of
				Congress. In the letter, Williams asked Jackson to support his proposal to
				establish a trading post at Fort Blount. Williams also discussed the conflicts
				between the Indians and Whites of the Cumberland area, and he stated that some
				500 families were currently residing on Indian lands. At the end of the letter,
				Williams also briefly mentioned the possibility of appointing a man by the name
				of Overton as Federal Judge.</note>
