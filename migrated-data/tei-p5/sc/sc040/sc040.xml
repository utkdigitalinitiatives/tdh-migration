               <name type="person">James Knox Polk</name>, Democrat, Governor of 
			 <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, 1839-1841, was the first college
			 graduate to fill the Governor's chair in the State. He was born in 
			 <name type="place">Mecklenburg County, N.C.,</name> Nov. 2, 1795; was
			 of Scotch-Irish descent, the original family name being 
			 <name type="person">Pollock</name>. He was graduated from the
			 University of North Carolina with first honors, 1818, and it is said that while
			 in college he never missed a single recitation or duty. This habit followed
			 him, and during his long term in Congress he was never absent a single day from
			 the House. 1806 his father moved to Tennessee and on leaving college James K.
			 came also. He studied law under 
			 <name type="person">Felix Grundy</name>, and was admitted to the bar
			 1820. In 1821 he was chief clerk of the State Senate, and 1823 was a member of
			 the House of Representatives from 
			 <name type="place">Maury County</name>. He helped to elect 
			 <name type="person">Andrew Jackson</name> to the United States Senate
			 at this session. He was a member of Congress 1825-1839, and was speaker of the
			 House 1835-1839. He defeated 
			 <name type="person">Newton Cannon</name>, the Whig candidate for
			 Governor, 1839 and at the two succeeding elections, 1841, 1843, he was defeated
			 by 
			 <name type="person">James C. Jones</name>, the representative of the
			 Whig party. 1844 Polk was elected President of the United States over 
			 <name type="person">Henry Clay</name>, Jackson's political enemy, but
			 he failed to carry his own state. Polk's administration as Governor is
			 unimportant while his presidency is crowded with interest. The Mexican war was
			 fought, the 
			 <name type="place">Oregon</name> controversy peacefully settled. He
			 retired to private life in 
			 <name>Nashville</name> at the close of his term; died June 15, 1849,
			 and is buried on the Capitol grounds.</p>
