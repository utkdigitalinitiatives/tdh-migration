            <p>Give me leave to introduce to your notice Mr <name>David Barclay</name> as a worthy honest man, in the opinion of all his acquaintance</p>
            <p>Mr Barclay a few years ago being then an active industrious man, had the misfortune to <choice>

                  <reg>break</reg>

            <p>He has just a competency, and is now wishing to procure Some means by which he can employ himself to the public and his own advantage</p>
            <p>It has struck him that he <add>can</add> make something by  <unclear>keeping</unclear> a ferry on <name>Tennessee</name> when the road from this country to <name>Georgia</name> crosses near <name>Nickajack</name> To do which, he must have yours, and the indians permission</p>
            <p>From the character of Mr Barclay, and so far as my own knowledge <unclear>attend</unclear> the propriety of his conduct may be safely <unclear>relied</unclear> on__ no man with more certainty</p>
            <p>It gives me pleasure to see all men do well, but particularly one who is desirous to do what he can, and who has been unfortunate as Mr Barclay and have no doubt that you <pb n="2" facs="sc179b.small.jpg"/> feel the same disposition</p>
