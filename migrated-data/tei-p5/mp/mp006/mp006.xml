               <note type="summary" anchored="true">The following document is a letter, dated September 13, 1819, from David Folsom of the Choctaw Nation to Reverend Elias Cornelius in Andover, MA.  Folsom writes in reference to an inquiries made by the United States government about a possible exchange of money for land within the Choctaw Nation.  Folsom also describes plans to build a new missionary school in Yello Busha.  At the close of the document, the obituary of David Folsom is attached.  Folsom fought with the US army against the Creeks during the Creek War and he served as a chief of the Choctaw Nation from 1826 to 1830.  He was one of the Choctaw leaders responsible for the treaty which removed the Choctaw Nation to Oklahoma.</note>
