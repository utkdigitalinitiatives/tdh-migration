            <p>Personally appeared before me <name>John Carmichal</name> a citizen of <name>Roane County</name> &amp; made oath that he is well acquainted with <name>Pathkiller</name>, a native he was the head of a family &amp; took a Reservation under the treaties of 1817 &amp; 1819 on <name>Tennessee River </name> he remained there until turned out by a writ after the land sales in 1820_ There have been various suits from that time to this year for the land, between the purchasers at the land sales &amp; Pathkiller_ I have understood Pathkiller lost the suit in the Supreme Court last summer, &amp; another at the Circuit Court in October at Kingston_ I was not there when the suit was tried_ I have lived across the River opposite Pathkillers Reservation, since before the treaties of 1817 &amp; 1819 &amp; have always thought Path an honest man_ I do not believe he has sold or received pay for his Reservation but on the contrary broke himself trying to get his land_</p>
