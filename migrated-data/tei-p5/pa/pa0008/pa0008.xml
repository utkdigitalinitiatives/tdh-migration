               <note type="summary">This is a receipt for payment of one hundred dollars to a Cherokee man named Long Beard, by the United States agent to the Cherokees, Return J. Meigs.  The sum was paid as compensation for the murder of Long Beard's son Blackbird by a white man in Cherokee territory in exchange for Long Beard's promise that he and his family would not seek retribution.  The marks of several Cherokee chiefs, including The Ridge, also appear on the document, dated December 18, 1809.</note>
