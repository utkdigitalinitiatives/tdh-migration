               <note type="summary">Daniel Ross, Indian Agent, writes to Major William Lovely and informs him that some horses were stolen out of his possession. He thinks that the horses ought to be paid for by the government in agreement with the Tellico Treaty. Daniel Ross believes there is sufficient evidence to name Estridge as the thief, and he would like action to be taken against him and his family, June 30, 1802.</note>
