               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter dated April 10, 1806 from Colonel Elias Earle to Return J. Meigs, agent for Indian affairs. Earle informs Meigs that an unnamed treaty recently signed with the Cherokees has not been ratified and speculates that the failure is attributable to an inaccurate map of the United States. Earle mentions a memorial sent by [James] Vann and [Charles] Hicks. He also discusses the storage of corn at Highwassee as opposed to Chickama[u]ga Creek, both inside the Cherokee Nation. Earle was a congressman from Greenville, South Carolina.</note>
