               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written on June 8,
				1797, to the warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation by John Sevier,
				governor of Tennessee from 1796-1801 and 1803-1809. In the letter, Sevier
				explains that there has been talk of a war between the United States and
				England. He says that England will try to get the Cherokee warriors to fight
				against the Americans, and warns the chiefs not to let their young men and
				warriors listen to this talk and remain loyal to the United States.</note>
