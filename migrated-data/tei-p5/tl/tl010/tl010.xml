				Joseph McMinn (1815-1821) to Secretary of State Daniel Graham on December 11,
				1818. Governor McMinn writes about his efforts to sign up Cherokees to move
				westward and having to pay and provide them with supplies for the trip. McMinn
				also reports that, despite previous oppositions, he had not encountered
				hostilities and had signed up 300 families since October 20 of that
				year.</note>
