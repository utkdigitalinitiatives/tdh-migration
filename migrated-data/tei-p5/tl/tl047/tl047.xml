               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Tennessee
				governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) , dated July 4, 1798, to Alfred
				Moore, George Walton, and John Steele. Moore, Walton, and Steele were United
				States commissioners responsible for forming a treaty between the U.S. and the
				Cherokee Indians. In the letter, Sevier informed the men that James Robertson,
				James Stuart, and Major Lachlan McIntosh had been appointed as agents to
				represent the interests of the state of Tennessee in the insuing treaty. Sevier
				stated that the state agents would do all that is in their power to aid the
				commissioners in extinguishing the Cherokee claims. Sevier explained that state
				agents were necessary because of their connections with the region at hand, and
				thus, they could better represent the interests of the people there and could
				prove advantageous to the negotiations.</note>
