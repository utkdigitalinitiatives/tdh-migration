            <p>Since the setting of

                  <name type="place">Franklin</name>
               </hi> to the

			 <name type="place">Natchez</name> road intersects the Indian boundary
			 line, the nearest and best way towards 
			 <name type="place">Nashville</name> to the 
			 <name type="place">Davidson County</name> line, but the court
			 unanimously opposed it. Because they said there was now a reduction of the

            <p>It is the earnest desire of most of the respectable characters in

			 remembered.
               </p>
            <p>Possibly the most eligible way of effecting it might be by your

            <p>And at the same time to provide against the possibility of the
			 courts and individuals not giving said consent, to write to the secretary to
