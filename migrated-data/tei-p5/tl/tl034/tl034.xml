               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written to Benjamin
				Hawkins, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, from Tennessee Governor John Sevier
				(1796-1801, 1803-1809) on February 17, 1797. In this letter, Sevier accounted
				the story of two slaves belonging to Captain James Richardson who had run away
				and ended up in the Cherokee Nation. The slaves were then taken by a member of
				the Creek Nation, who announced he would not relinquish possession of the
				slaves until some of his horses stolen by Cherokees, were returned. Sevier also
				told Hawkins that it is suspected that Creeks and/or Cherokees had recently
				been exerting aggression against settlers in the Cumberland, having killed one
				man and stealing several horses. Sevier requested that Hawkins attempt to have
				the slaves and horses returned as soon as possible. </note>
