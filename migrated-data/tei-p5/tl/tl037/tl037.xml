               <note type="summary">This document is a letter, dated March 17, 1797,
				written by Governor John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Governor
				Garrard of Kentucky. Sevier discussed the murders of Red Bird and another
				Cherokee by two Tennessee residents, Edward Mitchell and John Levingston.
				Sevier called the murders "wanton and unprovoked," and stated that he wished to
				have the perpetrators apprehended and taken to Kentucky to be punished.
				However, Sevier also stated that it would be difficult to apprehend the
				offenders. </note>
