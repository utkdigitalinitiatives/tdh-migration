               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Cherokee
				Colonel Gideon Morgan to Colonel Return J. Meigs on February 4, 1814. The
				letter is Morgan's account of a battle during the Creek War of 1813-1814, in
				which General Andrew Jackson's American forces allied with the Cherokee against
				Creek warriors. While it first appeared that the Creeks had the upper-hand in
				the battle, Jackson's troops were able to maintain their ground and gain
				victory in the end. Morgan was able to estimate the losses on both sides, and
				he stated that afterwards the Cherokee were permitted to return to their homes.
				Morgan, who was writing from Fort Armstrong, also reported that more troops and
				Cherokees were expected to arrive at the fort, and he noted that at that time
				provisions were scarce.</note>
