				1818, written by Governor Joseph McMinn of the state of Tennessee (1815-1821)
				to Daniel Graham, Secretary of State. In his letter, Governor McMinn wrote of
				his unhappiness and displeasure of being at the Cherokee Agency. He wrote to
				Graham that he abhorred the hatred and jealously demonstrated by citizens over
				every section of expansion and he was anxiously looking forward to going to
				Knoxville to attend business. </note>
