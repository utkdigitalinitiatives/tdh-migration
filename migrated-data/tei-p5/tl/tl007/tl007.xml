				McMinn, Governor of the state of Tennessee (1815-1821), and future agent to the
				Cherokee to Daniel Graham, Secretary of State, dated October 1, 1818. In his
				letter, Governor McMinn first apologized to Graham for his belated
				communication. Governor McMinn reported that he was still enrolling emigrants
				at a rapid pace. He concluded his letter by telling Graham that he would soon
				be able to return to Knoxville.</note>
