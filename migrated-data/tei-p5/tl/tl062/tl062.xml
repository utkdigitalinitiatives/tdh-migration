               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Governor
				John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Black Fox, Chief of the Cherokee Nation,
				dated December 20, 1807. In the letter, Sevier acknowledges that it was the
				Creeks that murdered two white men and not the Cherokees, as was previously
				under investigation. Sevier also expresses his resentment and distrust for the
				Creek Nation, and he condemns the Cherokee for allowing Creeks to pass through
				and settle in their nation. Sevier encourages Black Fox not to let the Creek
				settle on their land since they rob and murder both the Cherokee and the white
				people in the area. He also adds that there have been complaints that some
				Cherokees have robbed and threatened white settlers in the area, and he
				requests that they be punished and compensate the white settlers.</note>
