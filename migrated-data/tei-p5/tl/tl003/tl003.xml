               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written on June 9,
				1803, by Tennessee Governor Archibald Roane (1801-1803) to Secretary at War
				Henry Dearborn. In the letter, Roane informed Dearborn of a road in Tennessee
				which was believed to be inhabited by bandits who had been attacking
				travellers. It was unknown if the bandits were Indians, white men, or both.
				Roane offered some suggestions concerning the insurance safety of the
				travellers, including offering a reward to induce the Indians to help catch the
				culprits. Roane expressed concern that if it were discovered that the bandits
				were from an Indian tribe, relations between the Indians and whites in the
				region would deteriorate.</note>

               </choice>, whether White men
			 or Indians or both, has not been fully ascertained. I enclose a
			 <add place="supralinear">copy of a</add> Letter from 
			 <name type="person">General Winchester</name> on that subject. Not
			 long before the transaction mentioned by him three of the Citizens of this

                  <name type="person">Reuben White</name>
               </unclear>) killed, the others
			 made their escape, they were pursued several miles by three persons one of whom
			 they supposed to be a white man and the other two Indians.</p>
            <p>I am aware of the difficulty of devising any effectual plan to
			 ensure the safety of travellers on that road, or to <add place="supralinear">discover and</add> apprehend the perpetrators of such
			 crimes  Perhaps a <del type="overstrike">

            <p>I wish to hear from you on this subject as soon as Convenient. If
			 Similar cases should occur and it should appear that the offenders belong to
