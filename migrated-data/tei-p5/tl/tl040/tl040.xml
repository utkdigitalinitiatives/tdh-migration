               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Tennessee
				Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Cherokee agent Silas Dinsmore,
				dated March 30, 1797. In the letter, Sevier demanded that the Cherokee chiefs
				do their best to apprehend and punish those from amongst their nation who were
				responsible for the murders of several citizens of Tennessee. He also assured
				Dinsmore that it is his intention to punish any white men who committed
				violence against the Cherokee Nation. Sevier requested that Dinsmore read aloud
				to the Chiefs of the nation a letter enclosed with this one and to assure them
				that the state of Tennessee only desired to be at peace with them. </note>
