               <note type="summary">This document is a letter from Governor John
				Sevier (1796-1801) to Cherokee agent Silas Dinsmore, dated February 10, 1797.
				In his letter, Sevier sent apologies for several Cherokees who had been killed,
				wounded, or who were missing. While Sevier promised to do his best to seek out
				the perpetrators of such crimes, he also warned Dinsmore that the Cherokees
				should be restrained from retaliating. He stated that a war would bring about
				the destruction of the Cherokee Nation.</note>
