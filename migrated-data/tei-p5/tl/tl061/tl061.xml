               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written to Benjamin
				Hawkins, the Agent and Superintendent of the Creek Nation, by Governor John
				Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on December 20, 1807. Governor Sevier discusses
				the robbery and murder of two men from Tennessee, and that he suspects a member
				of the Creek Nation as the murderer. He asks the agent to investigate the
				situation and try to discover if a Creek Indian committed the murders. He
				claims that several parties of Creek Indians passed through the area of the
				killings around the same time and that these parties robbed and plundered
				several of the families in the area. Governor Sevier requests that the Creek
				chiefs put an end to the violence and migration of their people onto other
				lands.</note>
