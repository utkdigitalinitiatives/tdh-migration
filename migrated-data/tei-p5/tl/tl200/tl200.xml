               <salute>Dear General,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have just been informed that one of my negroes has been convicted of breaking open a store near <name type="place">Williamsport</name> and sentenced to be hung.—You will excuse the liberty, I have taken, as well as this scrawl— my health has been very bad, ever since I had the pleasure of seeing you at <name type="place">Washington</name>   which has prevented me from returning home, I am still under medical advice. I have to request it as a great favor to be permitted to send the negroe out of the state, I am unable and have been confined , In <name type="place">Maryland</name> and it appears, my enemies are determined to ruin my estate— I have reason to believe that <del type="overstrike">in his ha</del> his trial was not an impartial one, and that ⁁<add place="supralinear">the</add> evidence from some of the negroes were <unclear>circumstance</unclear> .— I feel much agitated and believe that justice will not be done. I therefore as a friend to humanity and citizen of <name type="place">Tennessee</name> would beg your permission to send him out of the state— You will excuse this scrawl, and accept my friendship.</p>
