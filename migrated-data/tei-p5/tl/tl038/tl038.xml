               <note type="summary">This document is an order issued by John Sevier,
				Governor of Tennessee from 1796-1801, to the sheriff of Hawkins County. Sevier
				stated that he had been informed by the governor of Kentucky of the murders of
				two Cherokees committed by Edward Mitchell and John Levingston, both citizens
				of the state of Tennessee and inhabitants of Hawkins County. In compliance with
				the demand of Governor Garrard of Kentucky, Sevier commanded the sheriff to
				apprehend Mitchell and/or Levingston and have them taken to the public jail of
				Kentucky. He also ordered that all civil and military officers aid the sheriff
				in the capture and transport of Mitchell and Levingston. This document was
				signed and sealed on March 19th, 1797. </note>
