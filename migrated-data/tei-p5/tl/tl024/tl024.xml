               <note type="summary">This document, entitled "Opposition of
				McGillivray the Great Chief of the Creeks" is comprised of two parts. The first
				is a letter written by Colonel James Robertson to Creek chief Alexander
				McGillivray on August 3, 1788. In that letter, Robertson discussed episodes of
				violence between the Creeks and/or Cherokees and American settlers and troops.
				Robertson also offered McGillivray a gun and some land in the Cumberland
				region. The second part of the document is a detailed explanation of
				Robertson's letter written by A.W. Putnam in 1859. Putnam provided an analysis
				of the historical context of the letter as well as his own opinions of the
				situations at hand at the time the letter was written. Putnam described the
				hostilities that existed between the Creeks and the American frontier settlers.
				He painted a portrait of the Creeks and the other tribes of the region as
				"treacherous and wily and cruel savages" who were working with foreign
				governments, particularly the Spanish, to undermine American aims. Putnam
				analyzed the connotation of Robertson's words to McGillivray, by stating that
				it was both threatening and complementing at the same time. Putnam also related
				details of the state of the American government at the time, particularly the
				shift from the initial loose confederacy of states to the current federalist
				form of government. He discussed how the initial instability, particularly in
				the South, of the newly formed United States, desires to settle West, and
				ongoing conflicts with the Spanish complicated relations with the Native
				American tribes, specifically the Creeks. Putnam also reported his analysis of
				McGillivray's character. McGillivray is presented as a cunning, influential man
				who was after his own interests and who was working with the Spanish to thwart
				American settlement. To Putnam, Robertson's letter presented McGillivray with a
				compromise--that his financial and political success would be guaranteed as
				long as he used his influence to encourage American aims in the frontier. As
				Putnam noted, two years after Robertson's 1788 letter, a treaty was concluded
				which established secure Indian land boundaries, ceded a large territory of
				land to the US, and gave McGillivray the rank of Brigadier General and a salary
				from the government. Thus, the US government was able to allay the Creek
				Nation. </note>

            <p>The spirit which would have sought revenge for such personal wrong,
			 was held in check by a high sense of duty and patriotic regard for the
			 well-being and safety of the community in which he occupied so prominent a

            <p>But it was important to learn the particular causes for these

			 the 
			 <name type="person">Creeks</name> who lived at a great distance 
			 on the other side of the 
			 <name type="place">Tennessee river</name>  a nation claiming

			 people of 
			 <name type="place">Cumberland</name> did not intermeddle, strong
			 suspicions arose in the minds of the whites that there must be
			 <add place="infralinear">some</add> deep and dangerous murder plot, 
			 some evil and foreign influence at work, to bring this mischief upon innocent
			 heads. </p>
            <p>The leading men here were not wholly ignorant of the intrigues and

			 jealous of each <pb n="5" facs="tl024e.small.jpg"/> other and alike <add place="supralinear">jealous</add> of the powers and consequences of

            <p>The settlers on the 
			 <name type="place">Cumberland</name> and in 
			 <name type="place">Kentucky</name> , were placed in
			 <hi rend="underlined">great straits</hi> not only 'betwixt two', but many
			 perplexities; treacherous and wily and cruel savages on all sides, and the
			 insidious and crafty machinations of agents of foreign governments tampering
			 with these savages and with their fellow citizens. They conceived then of none
			 of <add place="supralinear">the</add> modern facilities of intercourse and
			 business across those mountains over which they had clambered with so much
			 difficulty  peril; and very wisely looked to the great natural canal and
			 its tributary waters <del type="overstrike">as their</del> to bear their
		  produce to any available and profitable market; and that whatsoever power had
		  its controlling  strong hand upon the great artery could and would control
		  the circulation of the young and growing commerce of these vast western
		  regions: Every act affecting the free and uninterrupted flow of these important
		  life-streams, startled the youthful but giant freemen upon their borders. And
		  if there was a momentary cessation or occasional irregularity in the pulsation
		  of the great 
		  <name type="person">American</name> heart, and consequent disordered
		  motions in the limbs  extremities,  so that the State of 
		  <name type="place">North Carolina</name>
               <pb n="6" facs="tl024f.small.jpg"/> hesitated and
		  refused for a time to adopt the Constitution and become one of the glorious
		  Union:  though all saw  and acknowledges that the old Confederacy
		  was but a rickety and imbecile form of Government; and that something far
		  better framed  compacted was needed not only for common weal, but to
		  preserve the liberties and independence so laboriously and dearly obtained;
		   and in all these views,  even in the rejection of the new and
		  admirable form of government under which all the States have been so highly
		  prospered, and their number more than double, their population increased seven
		  fold and their commerce and business a thousand fold:  we say that
		  though the two delegates or representatives from the three counties of the 
		  <name type="place">Cumberland District</name> concurred in these
		  sentiments and in their own exclusion from the Union, 
		  <hi rend="underlined">it was not</hi> that they or any of them entertained
		  anti-republican opinions or were alienated from their republican brethren on
		  the Eastern side of the mountains. If they were to be detached from the great
		  family of free states, they looked to such popular government for themselves

			 We would be pleased to be at peace with all the tribes; you can exert much

			  Will you have a lot in our town a tract of two of land in our young

               </p>
            <p>These compliments did not cost much and the lands were then very

            <p>We do not find any such titles to this 'Big Indian' for property

               <name type="person">Alexander McGillivray</name> was indeed a man of
			 superior mind, of good education, of commanding influence, of unquestioned
			 bravery  of peculiar tact in diplomacy.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tl024p.small.jpg"/>
            <p>His father or grandfather was a 
			 <name type="person">Scotchman</name>, his mother a 
			 <name type="person">Creek</name> of the 
			 <name type="person">Wind Tribe</name> ,  but there were marked
			 traces of the 
			 <name type="person">Castilian</name> and of the

		  <name type="person">Frenchman</name>, an 
		  <name type="person">Englishman</name>,  and yet always an Indian
		  of the half blood.</p>
            <p>He was educated in 
			 <name type="place">Charleston</name>, and at an early age assumed the
			 position at Indian councils to which his talents, his appearance and his
			 influential <del type="overstrike">tribe</del>
               <add place="supralinear">family</add> entitled him; and throughout the War for 
		  <name type="person">American</name> Independence he was devoted to the
		  measures of 
		  <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
            <p>At the close of that war, he entered into close alliance with the 
			 <name type="person">Spanish</name> authorities of 
			 <name type="place">Florida</name> and 
			 <name type="place">Louisiana</name> : In that treaty he represented
			 the 
			 <name type="person">Creeks</name> and

			 <name type="person">Cherokees</name> and 
			 <name type="person">Choctaws</name> against the people of the 
			 <name type="place">United States</name>: This alliance was formed in 
			 <date when="1784">1784</date>, and he assigned as his excuse
			 or justification, that the 
			 <name type="person">Whigs</name> of the Revolution had confiscated
			 his estates and committed many offensive acts against his family connections;
			 and in compliance with his engagements he exerted himself, and most
			 successfully too, to keep the Indians in an unfriendly state of excitement and
			 enmity against the 
			 <name type="person">Americans</name> .</p>
            <p>The settlers upon the 
			 <name type="place">Cumberland</name> had no knowledge of any such

			 <name type="person">Spaniards</name>,  perhaps could not have
