               <note type="summary">This document is a letter, dated April 13, 1803,
				written by Archibald Roane, Governor of the State of Tennessee, to the citizens
				of Anderson County, Tennessee. Roane intended to address this letter to the
				citizens who were presently residing on lands that had been guaranteed to
				Indians, and he warned them that prosecution would be brought against them if
				they failed to remove themselves. Roane stated that the Indians were demanding
				their rightful land, and the federal government would comply with those
				demands, be it by legal prosecution, removal by troops, or both. </note>
