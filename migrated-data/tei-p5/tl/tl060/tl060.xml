               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Governor
				John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) to Cherokee agent Return J. Meigs, dated
				August 2, 1807. In the letter, Sevier discussed the murders of two white men,
				John Prigmore and Leonard Cash, committed, presumably, by Indians. Sevier
				expressed his condemnation of such acts and also his hopes that the Cherokee
				Nation will investigate the crimes and apprehend the culpable party if
				found.</note>
