				between William Blount, Governor of territories south of the Ohio River and
				superintendent of Indian Affairs for the southern district, and David Moore of
				Knoxville, Tenn. Dated October 12, 1794, the article was written in reference
				to a large flat bottomed boat, travelling down the Tennessee River, that was
				carrying goods belonging to the Chickasaw and Choctaw. Moore agreed to take
				charge of the boat and administer its journey down the Tennessee River to the
				mouth of Bear Creek, as so directed by Chickasaw chief Opoia Mingo. Moore would
				also be responsible for protecting the boat against attacks by the Creek and
				Cherokee, as well as protecting Opoia Mingo and his tribe. Furthermore, the
				article outlined how Moore and his crew would be paid for their
				services.</note>
