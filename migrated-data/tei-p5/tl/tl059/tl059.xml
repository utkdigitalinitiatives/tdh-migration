               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by John
				Sevier, Governor of Tennessee from 1796-1801 and 1803-1809, to Colonel Joseph
				McMinn, Colonel Samuel Wear, and Major John Cowan, dated August 9, 1804. In the
				letter, Sevier informed these men that he had received word of a meeting to be
				held with the commissioners of Georgia regarding a road that would be built
				connecting the two states, which would also run through Cherokee lands. Sevier
				commanded the men to attend the meeting, and he gave further instructions of
				the agreements to be made with the Georgian commissioners. Sevier wanted to
				make certain that both states would have an equal amount of work to do in
				constructing the road and reap an equal number of advantages from its
				existence. </note>
