               <note type="summary">This document is a letter written by Tennessee
				Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809), dated February 9, 1804, and
				addressed to the warriors and chiefs of the Cherokee Nation. In the letter,
				Sevier reported that the recent murders of Cherokee men in Buncombe County,
				North Carolina, were not committed by a resident of Tennessee. Sevier had
				received a description of the man suspected and had been informed that he had
				likely fled to Tennessee, in which case Sevier assured the Cherokee leaders
				that he would do his best to have the man apprehended. The Governor also
				briefly discussed business of a road being opened through the Cherokee Nation
				and suggested that arrangements for such should be made soon.</note>
