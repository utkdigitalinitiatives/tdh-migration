               <note type="summary">This document was written by Governor Joseph
				McMinn (1815-1821) to Secretary of State Daniel Graham on November 19, 1818.
				Governor McMinn writes that he will soon have taken the land east of the
				Mississippi River from the Cherokee and that if they want compensation, they
				must relinquish their possessions and claims to the United States within a
				certain number of years. He adds that the Cherokee look up to him for guidance,
				and he has been witness to vast amounts of monies and supplies trading hands
				for the trip west.</note>
