It admits of no delay, "now" is the proper time, May my God help You to improve it, to his honor &amp; glory and the Salvation of Your own immortal Soul, But my Dear Charles I fear like myself in earlier days You will acknowledge its importance, but postpone it until a more "convenient season" What argument shall I use to <add place="supralinear">induce You to</add> discard the black insinuation of the Prince of darkness, Shall I say that Your only regret will be that You did not <choice>
