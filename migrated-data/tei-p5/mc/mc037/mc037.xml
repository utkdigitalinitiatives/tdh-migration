            <p>I wrote to you a few lines from <name type="place">Campbell Station</name>.— The next day we came to <name type="place">Kingston</name>, and a few miles before we reached there, we were exposed to a rain, which drenched us thoroughly, and drooped our feathers— we had a rough time of it and <gap agent="damage"/> comfortable night; on <choice>

                  <reg>yesterday</reg>
               </choice> we came about 18 miles, and were greeted with another shower nothing remarkable occurred; at Kingston, my men being very wet, could not be kept from taking too much of what they called the "Rye—O"— <name type="person">James Brazelton</name>, took his full share, I expect he is to be very much trouble, but I will try every kind means to keep him from dissipation, and if I cannot succeed thus I will exercise my authority— which as Captain is more absolute than I could desire— There are others in my company, worse than James. And I have ⁁<add place="supralinear">already</add> been under the necessity of sending a Sergeant with a file of men, to bring several <unclear>soldiers</unclear> into camps, and put them under guard— I have had no other difficulty, except on account of  intoxication, that is to keep my men from drinking too much spirits—</p>
            <p>I have lost a pair of of my Mackinaw Blankets, but I still hope to find them in the camp of the <name type="place">Claiborne Blues</name> or of <name type="person">Waterhouse</name>. We have left the Claiborne Blues 6 miles behind <choice>

               </choice> at a camp ground, we swam across a creek and came on to this a beautiful encampment which you will see we have named Isabella  for miss <pb n="2" facs="mc037b.small.jpg"/>

            <p>I need not write you the particulars of our proceedings at <name type="place">Knoxville</name>, for <name type="person">Ann</name>will give you the particulars if she has not already done so— We have attracted the attention of every person in reach of the road;— I cannot tell you what route we shall go to <name type="place">Memphis</name>

            <p>My company were paid $25.— each to buy clothing— I was responsible for their uniforms, and some other purchases, &amp; I got the money from the bank ($2,570.)— I have not paid off  all the men yet, but there will not be enough left for me to get my full share which is $120—.</p>
            <p>I am very anxious to hear from you— Not a word have I heard from you since I left— Be sure to make <name type="person">Eliza</name> write; I cannot tell where to write to, now, unless, <del type="overstrike">at</del>
