I thought I was very badly hurt this morning— I went to take a bath in the wheel house of the S. Boat— the wheel was turning slowly, and I got as close to the wheel as I could, so that it might throw the water upon me— the steam was let on suddenly &amp; the wheel threw the water with such force I sprang farther off — my foot slipped &amp; I fell upon the open slats and cut a gash above my left ear which bled very profusely— but as soon as the bleeding ceased I dressed and ate a hearty breakfast. I feel no other inconvenience from it, except such I have often felt from a bruise, I will continue to write to you frequently, but my dear wife I have despaired of receiving your letters by mail— <choice>
