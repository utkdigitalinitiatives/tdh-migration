               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter dated July 7, 1839, from Albert S. Lenoir to his brother-in-law Charles F. Welcker in Roane County, Tennessee.  Lenoir writes to inform Welcker that Ellick, a slave he had hired from Welcker was found to have left his clothes behind in a hollow log as he had seemingly departed from Lenoir's property.  Lenoir states that he wishes to flog Ellick, but asks Welcker his opinion on the matter.</note>

               <name>Goin</name> arrived safe last evening, and I have taken the liberty of sending him back to acquaint you with some circumstances of late occurrence, in regard to which I am at a loss how to proceed.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening some fishermen found a wallet hid in a hollow log about two hundred yards up the creek which they examined and found to contain mens clothes_ <choice>

            <p>My own course if left unadvised would be to tuck him up &amp; flog him pretty well; but I think it best to <choice>

               </choice> you and wish you take some steps about it or advise me what to do_ perhaps it might be well for you to come over this evening_ but of this  you must be the judge_ if you do not come write_ We are all tolerable well</p>
