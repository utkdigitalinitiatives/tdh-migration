            <p>We have been expecting your sister and niece <unclear>here</unclear> for sometime to go to school.  The examination took place two days since, and went off with great eclat.</p>
            <p>The next session will commence about the 15th of July.  Perhaps you may not be out of the notion of sending them.  Write us upon this point; and also to give us the news of your country.</p>
            <p>We have nothing here, more than what is common with yourselves_ a high political excitement, which will abate in August.  The prospect of a glorious triumph of Democracy is bright.  How is it with you?</p>
            <p>The health of our place is very fine this summer.</p>
            <p>Evaline sends her respects to yourself and best compliments to Caroline, in which I join her, barely adding, that I am</p>
