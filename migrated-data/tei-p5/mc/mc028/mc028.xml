            <p>It is the best kind of Philosophy to derive consolation from <choice>
                  <orig>every thing</orig>
                  <reg>everything</reg>
               </choice> we can— I draw this consolation from your letter which only received last night, that your health is no worse, but perhaps some better, inasmuch as your Ma, has left you, and from the fact that you do not say one word about it— the very thing which I looked for in the letter with most anxiety, for having left you as I did in such feeble health I have felt the greatest solicitude on that account, and in my lonely rides, I often remember how hearty and what rosy health you had in our 'bridal days', and days of our courtship, for many of the scenes I've past since I left home, were scene<del type="overstrike">n</del>s which in those days we've looked upon <choice>
                  <orig>togather</orig>
                  <reg>together</reg>
               </choice> and that health has faded in my arms— You have shared my troubles and cares— as well as my hopes ⁁<add place="supralinear">&amp; my</add>
               <del type="overstrike">of</del> anticipated joys— And  believe my dear wife, you are dearer to me to-day than ever you have been in brightest days of glowing health &amp; promising prosperity—</p>
            <p>Your letter has caused me much anxiety about the debt to <name type="person">Wallace</name> for which I am security, I am very glad you wrote exactly such a letter as you did to <name type="person">Mr. McCulloch</name>—he owes me the money, and now is the time for him to pay it, and I think from your letter to him, he will try and do so. If he does not, I cannot but believe that Wallace will wait until the meeting of the November Court (I mean the Bankrupt Court) by which time I think I shall have made &amp; received money enough to pay the balance of the debt— I think I cannot be mistaken in the calculation that I shall make $1000.— by November— and the profits of my office will not stop there for I have heard of a good many others who are filing their petitions, and the times I believe will not improve &amp; if not, they must make a great many Bankrupts. <pb n="2" facs="mc028b.small.jpg"/> I am now very much in the notion of quitting the tavern keeping if we could do so— But there are two great difficulties in the way of our doing so— <name type="person">Humes</name> &amp; <choice>

               </choice> would not let us off, &amp; it would be a hard matter to find any body who would take it off our hands; besides what better business could we engage in? I might possibly do well at the law, but it would be uncertain; <choice>

                  <expan>although</expan>
               </choice> my friends all advise me to resume the <choice>

                  <reg>practice</reg>
               </choice> of the law and I have it in contemplation to do so.</p>
            <p>But I must give you a little of my history lately— I went from <name type="place">Greeneville</name> to <name type="person">Allen Gillespie's</name>—was very kindly treated— the old man is very low with <choice>

               </choice>, and it is generally believed he can never recover— but he seemed to think he would be well in a month or two. he did not swear any whilst I was there, and it appears very strange <del type="overstrike">for</del> to hear him talk and not to swear— his <name type="person">Patsy,</name> has married a very clever man I am told— He has a daughter just grown <name>Sarah</name> who is tolerable pretty, she had a beau when I was there, a brother of <name type="person">Brownlows'</name>— I <choice>
