               <note type="summary" anchored="true">The following document consists of two letters sent to Major General John Cocke from James White.  The first is a letter White writes from a military camp near Turkey Town, dated November 7, 1813.  White discusses General Andrew Jackson's advancements at the present stage of the War of 1812.  The second letter is a copy of a letter written from General Jackson to White, four days earlier on November 4.  In that letter, Jackson describes his  army's advancement to Ten Island, as well as a very brief description of a battle between General Coffee and  Native Americans, in which all of the Native Amer. men were killed and the women and children taken prisoner.      </note>
