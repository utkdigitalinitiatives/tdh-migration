               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from Jane Bell to her brother William dated August 17, probably 1840.  Jane offers the good news that, contrary to previous worries, she is still alive and well.  She also writes that millwrights have been in town and that they will be leaving soon. She regrets that she has not seen all their work as apparently it is as entertaining as a stage  show. She writes that she is expecting visits from many family members and that it would be nice if someone from TN came also. She wants William to write her weekly. </note>

            <p>You will <add place="supralinear">be</add> pleased to hear  that the  <date when="--08-12">12th</date> is past, and I am alive and well. I had no fear on the subject, nor any  presentiment, and therefore do not feel as grateful as I should do for my lengthened days. We are all as well as when you were here — The millwrights leave us tomorrow and I have not had time to see all the machinery in motion, though I heard <name type="person">Mrs. Young</name> say last week, that  persons often went <gap agent="damage"/> distance to see a show, that was not as well worth seeing as the machinery in the mill. She also says you look a wholesome youth, for the people here do not think you are of age <pb n="2" facs="sl107b.small.jpg"/>  On Friday last, <name type="person">Wylie</name> went to <name type="place">Franklin</name>, and did not have a letter from you, to any of the family. I was so certain of receiving one, that I was not prepared for such a disappoint<add place="supralinear">ment</add> consequently I had an attack of <unclear>degestion</unclear>,  from which a good hearty cry relieved me. You should never let me suffer any anxiety respecting you or our sisters, for when you are silent, my active imagination construct it into sickness or death. I sometimes wish I did not think so much about you all, and again I would not for any consideration   relinquish the pleasure which <choice>
