               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from Return J. Meigs, agent to the Cherokee Nation, to Major General John Cocke, dated September 3, 1813. Meigs writes that he thinks that  the Cherokee  who had volunteered to fight against the Creek should be put together and supervised by another Cherokee. The whole group should then come under the command of a United States citizen who is familiar with Cherokee fighting. He agrees with Governor Blount that the Cherokee expedition should be lead by Judge Cocke. </note>
