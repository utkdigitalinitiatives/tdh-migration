            <p>I had this pleasure yesterday by mail, and this morning an opportunity offers to send over Henry and the Brussells Carpet — I am somewhat at a loss to say when I shall invite⁁ <add place="supralinear">for</add> you ⁁ <add place="supralinear">to come</add> over, but at present think you had better remain where you are until the beginning of spring — When I hope we shall meet, not soon to be parted again — I am about paying my expenses ⁁ <add place="supralinear">at present</add> but so soon as the weather becomes more favorable I shall no doubt have as much as I can do and during my leisure moments I am reading medicine in a regular way. <name type="person">Doctor Ford</name> is here, and has offered me his <choice>

               </choice> and any assistance in his power— or that I may want in taking a regular course of reading. You know me well enough, my dear Mary — to convince you that I dislike to know less than any one else in any profession I may embrace in fact my ambition leads me to climb to the top— Old <name type="person">Mr McNairy</name> "says he will bet" Two hundred thousand dollars— that I will be a better Physician <unclear>(Nuntically)</unclear> in two years, than any in our city — save <choice>

            <p>The means I already possess in that way will be sufficient to keep yourself and boy above the <unclear>frowns</unclear> of the world — so much for so much about self —</p>
            <p>I hope Mother will be able to get along with Henry, as he is now sufficiently large to do anything that she may want done situated as she is— We send the carpet, thinking Mother will take better care of it, than can be done here— Mr Bowman (my patient) that I informed you ⁁ <add place="supralinear">of</add> as being so much afflicted is getting well— I cured a case in ten days, that has baffled the physicians here for two years. It was a negro boy. He is larger and sturdier than Henry every way, and on account of his disease sold on the Block about two weeks since for  151$ one hundred and fifty one dollars — his master<name type="person"> R. N. Greene</name> would not take four hundred for him— <name type="person">Mrs Duncan</name> and Ellen left for <name type="place">Mississippi</name>
               <name type="place">Madison County</name>— on the Kirkman on Friday last — <name type="person">William Stodhart </name>will leave in a few days by land with the Negroes and other property  I have nothing new— <name type="person">Ellen Ervin</name> is anxiously expecting a letter from you. If you will send her letter over to me — I will answer <pb n="3" facs="sl217c.small.jpg"/> it if you have concluded not to do so—</p>
            <p>Tell James his Papa says he must be a good boy, love and mind Ma and Grand ma and talk and think a good deal about his Papa. I heard from <name type="place">Alabama</name> last week — all well — All well at the Ridge <unclear>afore? <gap agent="damage"/>
               </unclear> days since— and we are all well here — By the spring (with good luck) I hope I shall be as bright as a new dollar.</p>
            <p>Make my best love to Mother and <gap agent="damage"/> our relations around you, My respects to the <name type="person">Dawsons</name>, <name type="persons">Trumans</name>, and <name type="persons">Russells </name>
               <gap agent="damage"/> friends. Kiss James for me. </p>
            <p>May heaven protect, guide and direct us through life; in such and that "Our light afflictions here" May work out for us a far more exceeding weight of glory in the world to come.</p>
