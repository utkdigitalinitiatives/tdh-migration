            <p>Some ten days since he returned to this place, with the hopes of  getting bail and meeting his trial, but our judges decided under our constitution they could not bail, though the allegations in the indictment do not constitute murder- He is therefore compelled to undergo imprisonment for a week — which is the most disagreeable circumstance in the matter</p>
            <p>His suffering is attributable to the state of political parties at this place, and to the circumstances attending the burning <choice>

                  <corr>of</corr>
               </choice> the Presidents picture. men who were connected in the affair now seek to make their revenge upon a man seemingly in their power. His trial will take place in a few weeks when I confidently anticipate he will be relieved of all embarrassment.</p>
            <p>In consequence of his situation his affairs, at Washington, may have been neglected, but they are now in a state <pb n="2" facs="sl283b.small.jpg"/> of forwardness for early and complete settlement. He will (he informed me) write to you in few days to explain his recommendation of <name>Maj <unclear>Bean</unclear>
               </name> having subsequently learned is not the man in politics he was represented — B is an applicant for an Indian agency</p>
            <p>Enclosed is a letter, for the president, which you will be so good as  to hand him</p>
