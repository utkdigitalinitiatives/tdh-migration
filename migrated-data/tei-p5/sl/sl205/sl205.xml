               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from John P. Freeman to Sally Bedinger Hamilton dated November 28, 1844. Freeman writes how upset everyone is  because Henry Clay lost  his  campaign for the presidency  to Polk, but he is at least relieved that Logan County, KY voted for Clay. He also inquires about a possible land purchase from Hamilton.</note>
