               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter dated June 8, 1850, from George House to his wife Mary in Nashville. He is on a business trip selling medicines. Most of the letter is naming the places he is going, which are probably in Alabama, but may be in Tennessee. He writes that the towns he is visiting are very small and that it will be difficult to sell out because of that. He misses her so much that he is dreaming of her. He sends love to the family in Nashville.</note>
