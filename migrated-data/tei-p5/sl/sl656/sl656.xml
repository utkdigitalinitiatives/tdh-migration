               <salute>Dear Sir__</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have been requested by the officers and men composing the newly organized Corpe. styled the "Columbia Blues" to address a letter to you with a request to know what prospects there are for their muskets being furnished from the public arsenal of the state; which, if you can spare a few moments, you will please answer.</p>
            <p>Our company numbers some forty three or four, and are tolerably well  organized and drilled and all we now want is muskets, which I trust you will grant us.</p>
            <p>We could get 4 names for the <add>purpose of drawing arms</add>
               <del>muskets</del> if we chose; but I suggested the propriety of asking for no more muskets than we wanted, as the balance would be wanted, or destroyed, or lost</p>
            <p>I know that the state guards at <name>nashville</name> have drawn muskets twice or three times, from the Penitentiary, and they have never numbered more than 35 or 40 men, except when they went out campaigning.__ By sending us an order for 45 muskets on Mr. McIntosh, you will very much oblige, on behalf of the corps, </p>
            <closer>
               <salute>Yours respectfully</salute>
