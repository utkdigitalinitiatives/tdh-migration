There has been an application for indulgence by several inhabitants who state, that they are not intruders but that they settled on the lands of the Chickasaws, and built a mill, at the special request of the Indians themselves as well as the Agent of that tribe, and that they now remain for its protection. This application is accompanied with the Permits of the several Officers, who have since been in command at <name type="place">Fort Hampton</name> But as I have no discretionary power on this subject, (the Agent having required the removal of all) I can only order the destruction of the property to be suspended, until I am informed by the Agent whether those families hold his permission for living on the lands in question I have written (of this date) to <name type="person">
