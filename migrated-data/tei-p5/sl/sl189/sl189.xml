               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter dated February 27, 1846. It is from a woman named Ada to L. E., who is probably a man. Ada writes about a terrible event in her town where a woman named Rosalie died from a broken heart after being betrayed by a womanizer. Ada is very upset because she feels that it is a common occurrence, and admonishes L. E. never to do anything of the sort. She also mysteriously writes that she may have to stop corresponding with him.</note>

            <p>Her young life ebbed away as she saw each hope prove false and the silken cords which entwined around her heart were rudely severed — She <unclear>was meret?</unclear> not but as ⁁ <add place="supralinear">a</add> fair flower beneath the blast — she faded fast With a broken heart — she fell a victim to the infidelity of man — and her gentle spirit winged its way from earth to heaven — where sorrow will never wring ⁁ <add place="supralinear">it</add> more — Her mortal remains lie <choice>

                  <reg>nipped</reg>
               </choice> by treachery — to gratify a false ambition and as infamous as false — Aye tis cruel to sport with the  <pb n="3" facs="sl189c.small.jpg"/> feelings of the heart — particularly where the ⁁<add place="supralinear">heart</add> is young and tender — "It may be sport for you — but death to us " —</p>
            <p>And this is woman's history — her hearts history <lb/> The tale of one who loved, as only woman loves — <lb/> In sickness and in sorrow — and in death —</p>

            <p>You have recently been saying to your friend <name type="person">Mr "Remmington"</name> that "Ada had forgotten you" — Not so — the finger of time may write furrows upon my cheeks — but can never obliterate from the heart, the memory of other days — Womans heart is sometimes compared to wax , or being easy to make an impression upon — yet when made — it is as lasting, as if written by a point of steel, upon a plate of brass — I did not see you but once I believe — during your last visit — as most of my time was spent with some friends in the country — and we had come in — to attend the "fair" — when I took occasion to drop you through the letter box — of the fair — a short epistle — I never learned whether or not you received it — There will be a day — (and perhaps not far distant) when this <choice>

            <p> I have heard something about your Mr. Remmington — and I have some curiosity to see him — I am told he has a great regard for the ladies — if so — it bespeaks him a man — aye a jewel of the "first water" — <pb n="4" facs="sl189d.small.jpg"/> I am writing this by candle-light — with the Thermometer twenty degrees below freezing point — so you must excuse my cold expressions all — but the infidelity of your sex — which should be entered upon the statute books, as murder in the first degree — and  punishable accordingly — for if there is any difference in crime it is ⁁ <add place="supralinear">in</add> favor of the being who stabs or shoots his fellow being; for then, the pain and suffering is soon over — but in the other case — the death is gradual — with a thousand hopes crushed, as soon almost as formed</p>
            <p>But I have written enough, in my feeble way, on this subject for the present — and as it is now ten oclock  P. M.  will close by wishing you health — happiness and a long life</p>
