               <name>A. V.

If they have not been I hope you will give them an insertion in your paper as early as practicable Brown is a prominent member of our party__ and may feel wounded (and I have on intimation that he probably does so) at the failure to republish what he says in Congress. in the <name>Tennessee</name> Democratic papers and especially in the Union.__  If you have omitted it, in this instance, I have  no doubt it has been accidental.</p>
