               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from M.S. Temple to Thomas E. Abernathy dated February 23, 1839. Temple comments on how nice the weather has been and how blessed he is that all his family and friends are doing well.  He writes about the trial of James McCaw, who was found guilty of murdering Jonas Bowers and the great excitement that surrounded the trial. Temple also writes that if the man, Mr. Loveless, who takes care of their land does not do more work, that Abernathy should discharge him.</note>
