               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from David F. Brown to his father Joseph Brown dated Febrary 22, 1843.  David updates his father about his family, his brother Joseph, and the death of a woman named Julia Ann.  David mentions skirmishes between Mexican and US soldiers as far into Texas as San Antonio. Twelve US soldiers were taken prisoner, but the people have hope they will be released because there is a revolution against Santa Anna going on in Mexico. He also mentions that Jane (unsure if he is referring to his aunt, wife, or sister in law by brother Joseph) wishes to visit Joseph in order to improve her health.</note>
