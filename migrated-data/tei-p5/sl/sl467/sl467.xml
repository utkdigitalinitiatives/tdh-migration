Richard writes that he will be marching to a treaty meeting at the Tellico Blockhouse. He expresses concern that the treaty will not last long. The meeting discussed is most likely with  the Cherokee and Creek. Richard mentions that Mr. McGhee won the contract to furnish supplies for the meeting.</note>
