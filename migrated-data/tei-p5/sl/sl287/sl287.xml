               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from Andrew Jackson Donelson, then serving as ambassador to Prussia, to his son of the same name, dated March 5, 1848. The father writes that he is going to obtain vacation time for his son from President Polk so that he may visit his family in Berlin. Donelson advises his son against accruing more debts and to learn to live within his financial means.  He writes much on how and why to keep track of one's finances.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Let it be your maxim in the commencement of your career <pb n="2" facs="sl287b.small.jpg"/> to live within your means. Consider that the basis of all morality and religion. The fatal error in my life was to be seduced into habits which were beyond my income. </p>
            <p>You have done well and I am delighted with the belief which your past conduct justifies that you have the mind and heart enough to secure your advancement and the means of support. But you can never do so unless you are able to execute the resolve that you will in future contract no debts. If you have only fifty cents per day it is as much a religious duty to spend less than that sum as it is to abstain <pb n="3" facs="sl287c.small.jpg"/> from the grossest immorality.</p>
            <p>When you receive the money which will pay your debts, discharge them and take receipts. Buy a little book in which to make a record of your daily expenses: and reserve some portion of it to state your income or pay. Consult this book always before you make a purchase and see whether you have the money to pay with. If you have not the money reject the article as you would a Rattle snake. It is better to go barefooted than to wear shoes which you cannot pay for. Enter into a covenant with God, my son, to keep this resolution. He will in his mercy bless your exertions and ultimately give you the means <pb n="4" facs="sl287d.small.jpg"/> not only to feed and clothe yourself  but to assist those whose imprudence or misfortune has made poor and friendless.</p>
            <p>Remember this advice.</p>
            <p>We are all well. I will write again by the next Packet.</p>
            <p>Accept my prayers for your health and the love and best wishes of all your brother &amp; sisters</p>
