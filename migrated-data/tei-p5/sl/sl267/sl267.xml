                  <reg>incalculable</reg>
               </choice> mischance the letter I wrote you soon after my marriage enclosing the money for the ring, was instead of being mailed, mislaid, and was to my very great mortification, found safely put away not very long since — I hope, Joe, that you will allow me to make the "Amends honorable" for I am truly ashamed that you have been treated so <choice>
                  <orig>shablily</orig>
                  <reg>shabbily</reg>
               </choice> — I trust then that you will understand that it was any thing but an intentional oversight —</p>
            <p>We have nothing new here. Our Election is now going on, and very little excitement. The Democrats are <unclear>sanguine about</unclear> their success, but I think we will be too strong for them, notwithstanding the apathy among the whigs —</p>
            <p>Please present me very kindly to your Mother &amp; sister, and to other friends —</p>
            <p>I am writing in a great hurry, and must ask you to excuse my very hasty letter — Accept <unclear>sir</unclear> my assurances of regard and  believe me</p>
