            <p>The measure adopted by the Directors of the State Bank to suspend for the present payments in specie is so correct under the existing State of things through out the world that all well disposed and well informed men will approve it but more especially on Knowing the reasons assigned__ The measure not only meets my approbation but entitles the Directors to my thanks, given as the Executive of the State, for their close attention to the interest of the State in that Bank which I ask the favor of you Sir to present in the highest terms of approbation of their conduct__ </p>
            <p>The Reasons by you assigned in explanation <pb n="2" facs="sl765b.small.jpg"/> of the manner in which the Business has been conducted and likewise the reasons and information by which the Directors have been governed in relation to the adopted measure are entirely satisfactory and conclusive__ Information of that measure or a copy of the correspondence as you may prefer will be laid before the General Assembly.</p>
            <p>I have the honor to be with the highest respect and esteem</p>
