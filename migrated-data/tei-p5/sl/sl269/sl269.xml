I took his pills last fall and think I derived some benefit from taking them, and am of the opinion that I would have been cured if it had not have been for a fall that I got off of my Horse in a pond, afterwards I was afraid to continue the medicine, as it laid me very liable to cold. I am now very anxious to give them a fare trial, and would like to have your advice about when to take them if it is so that you can let me have the pills at home it will be a great accommodation to me as I would much prefer taking <gap agent="damage"/> at home and I would obligate myself <gap agent="damage"/> in a<unclear>bond</unclear> of five thousand dollars that they never should be seen while I am taking them.
