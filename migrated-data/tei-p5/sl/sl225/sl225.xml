            </opener>
            <p>I went up from the river to the "Telegraph Office" Yester day morning to notify <name type="person">Mr Barksdale</name>  that Yourself and "Lou", were underway but alas the Wires Were under the Water, and it was no go — So I consoled myself with the reflection that You would reach<name type="place"> Clarksville</name> at least an hour before sundown and that <name type="person">Mr Martin</name>, the clerk, would see you safely to Your quarters, where I trust You are in the full enjoyment of health and spirits</p>
            <p>Did You blow up the "life preservers" and have them ready for an accident — Your Ma; said that they would not be of any service at least to You— that You would not jump into the water with one on; on any account Dont be afraid — should necessity require it — You will be perfectly safe with Your <choice>

                  <reg>preserver</reg>
               </choice> to get into the Water any where — I did not rest well last night, being very lonesome — and was up very early this morning, and off to market to deal in Beef, poultry, butter and eggs — We are well — I found out the Strangers now in our city — who we saw at <name type="place">Cincinnati</name> — <pb n="2" facs="sl225b.small.jpg"/> I attend old <name type="person">Mr Bateman</name>s funeral this evening — he died Yesterday about twelve oclock — <name type="person">Dr Edgar</name> preached his funeral by request of the old man, before his death —</p>
            <p>We have nothing new in the city — Tomorrow — "if clear" — will be a gay day — as well as May-Day — I expect  to be out with the Temperance badge — to assist in dedicating a "Temple" — Tell Lou we shall look for her and You on Next Saturday — <name type="person">Mr Bourne</name> has not as Yet reached home — When he comes I shall be about ready to <choice>

               </choice> off — but it May be not until the 10th or 12th—   Here is the Conundrum that took the "album" last night </p>
            <p>"Why is the <name type="place">Cumberland river</name> in its high Condition, like the <name type="place">California</name> Gold; Because it has a much Wider Circulation than when Confined within its banks"— Ask <name type="person">Mr Barksdale</name> what he thinks of it — I dont Know that I shall write to You again — unless some extraordinary occurrence should take place — I think it is hard that You should be absent the last ten days that I contemplate being at home for several months — However if it affords You pleasure in the trip I am Content — <pb n="3" facs="sl225c.small.jpg"/> Please remember Me very Kindly to all friends — I write in haste — with three persons talking to me — some about physic and some about one thing and some on other — <name type="person">Mr Fowler</name> and the Brooklyn is here will leave in the morning— Had a long talk with <name type="person">Mr Bostick</name> — <name type="person">Mr Zimmerman</name> has just sent for the life preservers you have — I have requested him to go to Clarksville — You must press Mr Barksdale into the Service to see you safely home — I was told by an officer of the Bank that they were expecting him —</p>
            <p>Wishing Yourself and Lou— a very happy, pleasant and <choice>
