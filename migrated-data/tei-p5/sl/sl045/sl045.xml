               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter written by Andrew Jackson to the Reverend H. M. Cryer on November 13, 1836. In the letter, Jackson discusses the political atmosphere surrounding the 1836 Presidential election. He discusses the support of Martin Van Buren by a majority of the states. The Whigs running against Van Buren have, according to Jackson, told lies about him and are hypocrites.</note>
