Jane writes that she misses everyone and that she wishes that one of her family could visit her. She writes a lot about death and that this world does not leave enough time to prepare one's self  and one's soul for the inevitable. She shares in her sister's grief over the loss of their parents and hopes that they will be the better for it. She also worries over her own  husband's ill health.</note>
