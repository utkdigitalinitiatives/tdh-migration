            <p>I was confined three or four days last week by a bilious attack; every symptom of which is, however at length, removed. This circumstance will account for my not having answered your letter sooner; as I was not able to write when the mail left this place <del type="overstrike">for</del> last week for Nashville.</p>

I have often thought that I would ask of you this favour, but knowing as I did, that your age and health were scarcely equal to the constant attention necessarily required in the management of your business, I have feared, the request might justly be considered unreasonable. I would therefore ask you to write to me only <pb n="2" facs="sl196b.small.jpg"/>
               <sic>only</sic> when your leisure and health will, without inconvenience to yourself, permit. The good advice for the regulation of my conduct through life, for which I am indebted to you, sanctioned as it is, by your long experience and intimate acquaintance with the World must always be held in the highest respect by me, and will ever be remembered with feelings of gratitude.</p>
