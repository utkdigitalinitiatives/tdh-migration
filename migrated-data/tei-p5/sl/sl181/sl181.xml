               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter dated Jan. 13, 1830 from Joseph Porter Brown to his father Joseph Brown. Joseph P. is explaining why he feels it necessary to leave Randolph. He is taking a trip down the Mississippi to find a situation in which he can make some money. He feels that he is ready to embark on a business career now that he is almost 22 years old. He also says that he is poor, and cannot make a living in Randolph.</note>
