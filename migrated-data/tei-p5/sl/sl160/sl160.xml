            <p>I beg leave to inform you of my arrival at this place, and that I am somewhat better than I was when we parted at <name type="place">Smithland</name> .  Still finding myself rather feeble, I have concluded to go to the <name type="place">Virginia Springs</name>  &amp; to pass a week or two there before I proceed on to <name type="place">New York</name>
            </p>
            <p>The following morning after you left, I got on board the <unclear>SSW</unclear> Cincinnati, for <name type="place">Louisville</name> — We overtook the Peytonn  about 100 miles below Louisville with her other shaft broken, &amp; took her in tow.  Besides the shafts, the engine of the Peytonn is much injured — The repairs which the boat will require, will I am told cost at least $7,000— <name type="person">

            <p>Remember me most kindly to your lady, &amp; to your good Uncles.  I regret exceedingly that I was deprived by indisposition of the pleasure of seeing them at Nashville — I think, however, on account of my health,  that I acted prudently in not going up the <name type="place">Cumberland</name>.</p>
