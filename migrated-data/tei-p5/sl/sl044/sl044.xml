               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter written by Andrew Jackson to Robert Chester on March 3, 1833. In the letter, Jackson informs Chester that his nomination as surveyor has been rejected by the Senate because he is not a resident of Mississippi. Jackson's attempts to get the Senate to reverse their decision was futile, and they appointed a man that had previously been turned down for the same reason as Chester. </note>
