Margaret writes about her grief over the death of their father, followed unexpectedly by the death of their  mother. She includes notices of other people who have either died or are sick. She also mentions how favorable the weather has been for the crops and peaches. Their brother is giving a speech on temperance that Margaret wishes Jane could attend. She writes that it will be almost impossible for her to visit Jane , and that it is her wish for Jane and their brother Sam to come to Clover Dale for a visit.</note>
