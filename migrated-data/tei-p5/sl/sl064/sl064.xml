               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter written by Sam L. Smith to the Postmaster General on November 27, 1824. In the letter, Smith informs the Postmaster General that on the mail route from Sparta, Tennessee to Tompkinsville, Kentucky, one mail carrier's horse died and another became sick and could not continue the route. He is concerned about the mail not continuing on its route to Meigsville and on to Tompkinsville. Sam Smith concludes the letter by asking the Postmaster General the appropriate age for a person to become a mail carrier.</note>
