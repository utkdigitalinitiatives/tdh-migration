               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter to Joseph Anderson dated April 5, 1798. The author is probably Governor John Sevier. Sevier is writing responses to Anderson's last letter. He  mentions Judge David Campbell (whose arrest caused some disagreement). Sevier also states that he hopes Tennessee's border is the Tennessee River, as that would be best for the state's prosperity.</note>
