               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter written by N. B. Hamilton to  Doctor James L. Alexander on November 5, 1838. In the letter, Hamilton discusses several social events that have occurred in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, including a Ladies' Fair and participating in the activities at a local singing school. Hamilton also mentions that a volunteer company has gone to the Cherokee Nation, but he does not know why they have gone there. He concludes the letter by stating that the corn crop will be good in his area that year, but little fruit will be available for sale.</note>
