               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from E. Greer to his brother A.P. Greer, dated September 25, 1826. Greer's Texas military unit has just taken over the Mexican town of Monterey. E. apologizes for not writing in a while, but explains that it is very difficult to obtain the necessary materials. E. writes about how fortified a town Monterey is, and that it is very beautiful. Greer describes the approach and attack on Monterey and mentions some Generals involved including Taylor and Worth. He also mentions the Mexican General Armpudia and his surrender to Taylor.</note>
