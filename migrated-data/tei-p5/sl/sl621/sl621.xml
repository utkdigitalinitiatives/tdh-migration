               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This document is a letter dated June 27, 1842 from Thomas Barry near Gallatin, Tennessee to his state governor James C. Jones in Nashville.  In the letter, Barry resigns his seat in the state legislature as a representative of Sumner County.  He tells the governor that he feels it is his duty, as well as that of his colleagues to resign in order to bring the matter of state districting to a conclusion.  In the second page, labeled "private," he discusses proposing a law to compel banks to receive their own notes for their debts.</note>

            <p>I am entirely satisfied from <add>what</add> I have seen and know that the present Legislature never can agree upon the questions of districting the State and of electing US senators under such a state of things I think it is the duty of every Representative and Senator to resign so that the people may have an opportunity of settling those questions, <del>and</del> For it is all important to their welfare that the State should be represented in Congress.  It seems to me that every member of the present Legislature who <add>had</add> rather serve his country than hold office is under such a state of things <add>bound</add> to resign I should doubt the Patriotism of any man who would cling and hold on to office when he knows by <choice>
