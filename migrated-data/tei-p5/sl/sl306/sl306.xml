            <p>
               <name type="person">Mr Edwards</name> informs me that <name type="person">Mrs. Cobb</name>s, claim for a pension is suspended on account of the want of satisfactory proof of the service of  her husband, and of her marriage before the termination of his service. It is now so late in the session that no action of any importance can be had in congress upon the petition of Mrs Cobb, and I have concluded to delay its presentation until the session,_ It is a <unclear>very</unclear> difficult matter to get these claims through &amp; if the proof which Mr. Edwards requires could be possibly obtained, it would be far better <pb n="2" facs="sl306b.small.jpg"/> than to place her claim before congress. many claims of this kind have been before congress for many years &amp; have not yet been acted upon_</p>
