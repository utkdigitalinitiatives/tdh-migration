               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from John Overton to David Henley, dated December 10, 1795. Overton reports that persons named Allison and Evans are broke, and consequently have stopped making payments on their debts. The debts are owed to  Mr. Tait. Overton blames Governor William Blount, who also owes money to Tait, as the prime cause of everyone's financial problems.</note>
