In the letter, Barry discusses her recent travels across the state, paying special attention to the landscape of the various counties and the variation in taste and color of their streams.  She also expresses great awe at traversing the Tennessee River, and she discusses other news of family and friends, including the high rate of sickness and death in the region.</note>

We have had an uncommon winter in more respects than one.   Since my recollection I have never heard of as much sickness and as many deaths.  Since my recovery from the fever last fall I have enjoyed, interrupted health &amp; I suppose <pb n="2" facs="sl130b.small.jpg"/> you would scarcely recognize the pale thin invalid of Charlotte in the blooming lass of Pleasant Plains.  My personal appearance has alone experienced a change for I still think of your lectures with the same gratitude.  I formerly felt &amp; look up to your superiority in talent &amp; information with the same admiration unmixed with envy.  As my letter concerning my trip to the District has miscarried I will in this as I have nothing better to write give you some account of it.  <name type="place">Montgomery</name> being my own county I scarcely noticed setting out like most travellers to see foreign wonders &amp; passing over perhaps  what is more worthy of remark near home.

There is something also uncommon in the streams in which the country abounds they being of a deep blue &amp; very clear I can scarcely describe my feelings on arriving in sight of the <name type="place">Tennessee river</name> it was a bright morning &amp; as we started early we arrived on its banks just as the mists had arisen sufficiently high to give us an unobstructed view of the rive &amp; its banks.  It appeared to me a world of water.  You who have crossed the  Ocean will laugh at my admiration and wonder being lavished on a stream inferior to many in our country but it is by far the largest I ever saw. From the sensation of awe I experienced in crossing I am convinced I am too great a coward   ever to cross the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>. The change in the appearance and taste <pb n="2" facs="sl130b.small.jpg"/> of the water as soon as we entered <name type="place">Henry County</name> in the District is surprising it had the <choice>
