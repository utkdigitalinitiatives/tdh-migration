The author is proposing his idea of an interstate railroad from Indiana to South Carolina. The author gives many reasons for the railroad, and refers to other papers on the topic. He also suggests that the idea be put forth to their respective Legislatures.</note>

               </choice> my attention; for several years  past &amp; I have some to come to the conclusion, I will bring it forward this winter in the Legislature of the state of Indiana of which I am a member- I thought it would be prudent, to write you, &amp; request your opinion, &amp; cooperation upon this subject; together with such other information as you might think proper to <unclear>communicate</unclear>_ The <name>Mississppi</name> valley is the most productive region in produce upon the globe; &amp; ought to be opened to the southeast sections of this union_ it would be an <unclear>incalculable <add>mutual</add>
               </unclear> advantage to both sections In this produce is the cheapest; in that the dearest, of any part of the government In a direct line, nature seems to have placed an almost inseparable barrier between_ yet I have no doubt art can break it down, by instructing a rail road, upon which; every kind of produce may be transported, nearly as cheap, if not cheaper, than upon the <name>ohio</name> &amp; Mississippi rivers in Steam boats__ if you should doubt this, I would refer you to an <unclear>essay</unclear> of <name>Mr haularen</name> on rail roads, published on the <pb n="2" facs="sl603b.small.jpg"/> National <unclear>Intellegencer</unclear>of 1826, say in Sept, and october the <unclear>last <choice>
