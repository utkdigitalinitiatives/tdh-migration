Yesterday the council assembled &amp; gave me in writing the following <gap agent="damage"/>   for their objections to the line as run by you, with a request that I would transmit it to their father the President of the UStates vis Surveying &amp; laying off a town at the <name>Chickasaw Bluffs</name> before the line was run, &amp; not giving <del>due</del> due notice agreeable to treaty__ Starting the line without any commissioners on behalf of the <name>Chickasaw Nation</name>__ running the line without proper instruments Not Starting the line until eight or nine O'Clock in the morning__ Not blazing the trees as the  treaty calls for.  They further request that the <pb n="2" facs="sl584b.small.jpg"/> President would appoint major Freeman to run another line between them &amp; the State of Tennessee, as they want nothing but justice done there.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a fair &amp; plain statement of the case, &amp; if it should prove by another line being run that the present one is incorrect no doubt the nation will receive from our government ample justice.</p>
