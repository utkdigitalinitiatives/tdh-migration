               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter dated January 20, 1815 from John McKee to General James Winchester.  McKee reports on the business of recruitment service, specifically, that  during the winter season most Choctaw gun-owners are currently engaged in hunting food for their families, and therefore, that his quarter should not be relied upon until their return.  He also mentions the recent  victory of General Andrew Jackson  at the Battle of New Orleans against the British, and as a result, the Choctaw Indians will probably not be needed there.</note>
