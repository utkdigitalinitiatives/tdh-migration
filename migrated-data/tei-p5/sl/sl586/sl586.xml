               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from Thomas Wright to General James Winchester, dated April 22, 1808. Wright is the U. S. agent to the Chickasaw Nation. Wright is writing on behalf of a Chickasaw who is inquiring about the fate of his brother. The man is rumored to  have been killed in the area of Sumner County, therefore Wright hopes that Winchester has heard of it.</note>
