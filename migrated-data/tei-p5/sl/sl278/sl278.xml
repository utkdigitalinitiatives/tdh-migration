Laughlin is writing about the political situation, especially as it pertains to President Jackson. He mentions some promising Democrats. Laughlin promises to keep Donelson updated on the news that he will not find in the newspapers. He mentions a dinner being given in honor of Colonel Polk in Mooresville. Laughlin writes that he and some others are supporting Polk for Speaker of the House, over a man named Bell.</note>

               </choice> together with your letter for publication, have all been duly received, and shall be confidentially attended to as desired. Your communication for the Union has been given to the public as you will have seen. The further course I shall take in relation to the matter of the franks, and the new remarks of the Banner, you will see next week.</p>
            <p>The papers will inform you of the progress our new General Assembly is making in the business of President making. What they will do with <name type="person">Ridley</name>'s resolutions, now lying on the table of the House, specifically approving severally of the leading measures of the administration, and of the conduct of the President separately in relation to each, yet remains to be seen. These resolutions are framed with a special view of having a distinct vote taken in relation to each important measure. It will be a sore pill to some hypocrites and some apostates to be forced to vote in that way, but they will be compelled to do it or disgrace themselves by giving the  go by, in some way, to the whole in a mass. — In debate, we have decidedly the advantage of talents. <name type="person">Nicholson</name>, <name type="person">

                  </choice> Polk</name>'s convert from the last remains of Whiteism, is a great accession to us. <name type="person">Guild</name> is a man of good sense a bold generous fellow — but who, by the by something manifests more <pb n="2" facs="sl278b.small.jpg"/> courage than discretion. In Ridley, <name type="person">Humphreys</name> ( a son of the Judge and member from <name type="person">Fayette</name>) and <name type="person">Turney</name> we have men equal to the ablest of the enemy. Some of their best men, don't go the whole — <name type="person">Carnthers</name> for instance. In the Senate, <name type="person">Craighead</name> — and ⁁ <add place="supralinear">I</add> rather hoped for than expected it — is taking good ground. But even up to this time, it is very much undecided how a good many respectable members will finally stand on the great questions which now agitate the state growing out of the Presidential controversy. Matters on hand, as they arise, which you would not learn from the papers, I will communicate in such hasty letters as I can find time to write at least once or twice a week.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, the people of <name type="place">Maury</name> are to give Col. Polk a dinner at <name type="place">Mooresville</name>. <name type="person">Mr Grundy</name> started out as a guest on yesterday, and is to make a speech. I have besought ⁁ <add place="supralinear">him</add> as with tears to cry aloud and spare not. The time has actually arrived here now, when, as Mr. <choice>
                  <abbr>G.</abbr>
                  <expan>Grundy</expan>
               </choice> said of the sword in his war circular of 1812, "cursed is he that keepeth back himself from the fight, or holdeth back his means." That we will win the day next year I feel no reasonable fears, but ⁁ <add place="supralinear">it</add> will be by a hand fought battle.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="person">Bell</name> admitted in a conversation with <unclear>
                  <name type="person">Falls</name>
               </unclear> of the Mississppian, a few weeks since, that unless they can unite all branches of the opposition in the support of <name type="person">Judge White</name> next winter, their case will be gone and hopeless. The ackowledgement was not made confidentially, and I urged Falls to use <pb n="3" facs="sl278c.small.jpg"/> it in Mississippi when he got home. What he may be able to make out of it, or what course he may take in relation to it, I do not know.</p>
            <p>There will be a strong necessity, in order to aid us here, of running Col. Polk for speaker, if it can be done with the <gap agent="damage"/> wishes of our party. In correspondence which I have had with <name type="person">
                  <choice>
                     <abbr>Gov.</abbr>
                     <expan>Governor</expan>
                  </choice> Reynolds</name> and <name type="person">Col. May</name> of <name type="place">Illinois</name>, I find that the delegation of that state have the matter much at heart. This correspondence  was sought by Gov. <choice>
                  <abbr>R.</abbr>
                  <expan>Reynolds</expan>
               </choice> with a view of consulting our friends here. He informed me that he had written to <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name> on the subject. I wrote also to Mr. Blair but have received no answer. I am entirely sure that <name type="person">Shields</name>, <name type="person">Huntsman</name> and <name type="person">Dunlap</name> of our delegation will all go with <name type="person">Johnson</name> in supporting Polk against Bell. In Illinois, at least <del type="overstrike">one paper</del> two papers — the Springfield Republican and St. Clair Gazette — have avowed their preference for Col. P. as has been ⁁ <add place="supralinear">also</add> done by the Democrat, if not others in <name type="place">Alabama</name>. The Albany <unclear>Osgers</unclear> , I think, gives an intimation in its remarks on Col. Polks speech of June last. This, however,   is a weighty matter which can only be adjusted after our friends get to <name type="place">Washington</name>. It is a matter, however, of great importance here, for we now feel certain that if Bell finds he can't beat Polk himself, he is determined to try to have it done by another, and he would like to have that other to be one of our friends. When <del type="overstrike">such men as</del> old <name type="person">Peteray</name> here, who knows Bells' plans as far he would divulge them to such a man, as ⁁ <add place="supralinear">is</add> told by our friends that Polk can <gap agent="damage"/> ell, he always takes a pinch of snuff, and <gap agent="damage"/> ntly asks, if <pb n="4" facs="sl278d.small.jpg"/> Polk can beat <name type="person">Mason</name>. That he intends <del type="overstrike">it</del> ⁁ <add place="supralinear">the remark</add> as an answer, and not as asking a question, is certain.</p>
            <p>Please present my kindest respects to the President, and to <name type="person">Col. Earl</name>and for yourself,</p>
