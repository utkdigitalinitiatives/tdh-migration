               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter dated July 31, 1844 to Mary House from her husband, George House. He writes quite a bit about how much he misses her. He even stares out his window at night in the direction she lives. He gives the news of his friends, and their family.  He also describes in detail a recent Whig rally and looks forward to their convention. He gives the news of their family, and the people that want her to write to them. He also advises her to take boneset tea if she gets another cough.</note>
