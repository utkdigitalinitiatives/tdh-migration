            <p>In obedience to the instructions given us by you for taking the latitude of Walker's line between this State and <name>Kentucky</name>, &amp; also of that recently run by <name>Colonel Steel</name> of <name>Kentucky</name> in this state: We now have the <choice>

               </choice> to report that, on the nineteenth of this month we commenced the business assigned us, and found the latitude of the line run by Colonel Steel at a point near <name>Springfield</name> to be 36 degrees 28 minutes and 44 seconds. We then proceeded to Walker's line  and found the latitude of the same of the point where it is crossed by the road leading from Springfield in this State to <name>Russelville</name> in Kentucky to be 36 degrees 37 minutes 9 seconds. From this <add>it</add> appears that the line run by Colonel Steel is <unclear>south</unclear> of latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes one statute mile <pb n="2" facs="sl771b.small.jpg"/> and a half: and that Walker's line is north of latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes eight statute miles: making the distance between the two lines at or near the points where the latitude was taken nine and a half statute miles very nearly. From the very <choice>
