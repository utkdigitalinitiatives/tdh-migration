            <p>I was duly honored with the receipt of your letter, touching your appointment from the president of the <name>United States</name> authorizing you with <choice>

            <p>I acknowledge  that the Legislature of the United States have acted very generously in transferring their right in this spring, to the State of <name>Tennessee</name>, and I also admit the justice of charging this State with the necessary expenditures: But I have to regret being compelled to assure you that there are no funds at my disposal by which to enable you to affect this very desirable object.</p>
            <p>It is therefore obvious that no public resources can be placed at your command until the  <pb n="2" facs="sl755b.small.jpg"/>  sitting of the next Legislature, when, I flatter myself, no difficultly will arise in obtaining an appropriation commensurate with all the necessary demands.__</p>
