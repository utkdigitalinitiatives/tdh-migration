               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter to Sarah Woods from her sister Jane, dated June 28, 1843. Most of the letter is updating Sarah on the activities of the townspeople. Jane also tells Sarah that there is some question as to where Joseph will be spending the fall, if he will be sent away to school, stay with Maria Price, or stay home at Westwood. The death of Henry Stephens is reported. Jane also mentions that people are trying to build a Second Presbyterian Church.</note>
