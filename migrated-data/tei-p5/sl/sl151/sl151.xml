               <salute>Dear Brother:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am happy to inform you that I arrived here on the evening of the 4th  July without accident to myself or horse, and  without the least inconvenience or sickness to myself or horse. I found <name type="person">Adelaide</name> and the children in perfect health, and the girls also. They have grown very much, you would not know the girls. I wrote <name type="person">Butler</name> on my arrival here, and awaited for him one week, <choice>
                  <orig>whin</orig>
                  <reg>when</reg>
               </choice>  I became somewhat impatient,  I then went in search of him, and after two days hard riding I found him. He had met with an accident which had prevented him from attending to business for  some months and had two weeks prior to my arrival, engaged with a gentleman by the month. I told him and the gentleman that it was actually necessary for him to leave in a few days, — he told me he would try so to do on monday that was on Thursday, and that he would be up on Monday  the same day, in the Steamboat, but here it is near that day week and I have not seen or heard from him since. He seems to be anxious to go out, and says <name type="person">James</name> is determined to leave <name type="place">Virginia</name> this fall. I wrote <name type="person">Richard</name> to come up with <name type="person">Mary</name> as soon as possible, so I could fix her, by the time Butler was ready but I have not as yet heard of or seen  him. Our family are the most stupid and tardy species of  creation  His conduct here was of ⁁ <add place="supralinear">the</add> cast you and myself judged it be. We were not mistaken in our suspicions, if <name type="person">Laura</name> and <name type="person">Rebecca</name> are to be believed. Adelaide says she thinks so too, but says the lowest and most vulgar were his associates —  He <pb n="2" facs="sl151b.small.jpg"/> came to her on Sunday to fix his clothes after <choice>

               </choice> all the week off which, she refused, as it was not of much consequence,   — She had done all the day before, as she thought. She sent for him and talked to him about conducting himself in the manner he did. He was driving a butchers cart about the town, and she was told of it, and sent for him and told him that he was disgracing his sisters, after which he left  — Driving a cart with meat to every one's door, without intending to learn the business. Watch him, he can do right if he wants — He thinks hard of Adelaide, Laura, and <choice>

                  <reg>Rebecca</reg>

            <p>Richard intends this fall to move South,  I  will see him, and talk to him. <name type="person">Dr. Buchanan</name> is very uneasy here, he told me in the street that he had to sell a negro or two a year to live.</p>
            <p>Our conversation relative to my coming out there next spring meets Adelaide's wishes in every particular, her Brother has got his business in such a fix that he could not settle it up sooner than two years, though he intends to move to <name type="place">Alabama</name>, after he can settle his business. If you can purchase me a lot in that town below the <name type="place">

He is quite a fine fellow I think, — give my respects to him. — Adelaide sends her love to Sister and you and the children.
