Mr Worthington has a copy of my talk with the Indians, and has been particularly instructed upon most of the points upon which Mr Peniurs wishes to be informed. He will therefore be able fully to explain to him the course which I have thought ought to be pursued towards the Indians within the Floridas.— A copy of this <emph>talk</emph> I also transmitted to you in my letter of <choice>

            <p>Mr Peniurs has desired permission to present his accounts for settlement to the Secretary of East Florida— this I could not permit, in as much as I have forwarded my <pb n="2" facs="sl009b.small.jpg"/> resignation as Governor, and to avoid any prolixity in the settlement of his accounts, have advised him to transmit them forthwith to you. as I had given you my views as to the proper course to be pursued with the Indians now in Florida, I have declined giving him any instructions on that subject, as I was awaiting your further instructions.</p>
