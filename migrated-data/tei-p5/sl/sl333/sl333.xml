               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from H. S. Howell to Adam Fergusson, dated February 13. It was written in the late 1840's. Howell asks for Fergusson's help in a deal Howell made with H. H. Holland, Buck Hart, and Mr. Farley.  Howell writes that he misses Tennessee, and that it was the happiest time of his life. He writes that he likes Wisconsin partly because it is a Democratic state. Howell is disappointed that the Whig party won the last election. He hopes they will not reverse the decisions, policies, and laws of the previous administration.</note>

            <p>I received, about 2 years since, a letter from Farley stating he would soon get the money from Hart__ I have written him since but received no answer and am at a loss to know the reason being ignorant whether he still lives in Carthage or what has become of the note__  Will you have the goodness to make the necessary enquiry of Farley, or whom it may concern, and inform me of the result__  If Farley still has charge of the matter please request him to write me, or if his concern  have been left with others, enquire of them__</p>

            <p>Since I left your state I have lived in <name type="place">Iowa</name> and the <name type="place">Jarseys</name>  but am now permanently, settled here_ I often think of my residence in Tenn_ the associations there formed and the many agreeable and pleasing interviews with friends and I <unclear>recur</unclear> to that period as the most happy in my life_ I admire the climate of Tenn_ and the habits and frank, open, kind feelings of the inhabitants, to such an extent that I regret at times ever leaving there_ I however like <name type="place">wisconsin</name> well. It is a young and thriving state and above all Democratic, and I trust will ever remain so_</p>
            <p>How have your schools prospered since I left are they flourishing_</p>
            <p>What kind of times had you during, that last canvass not as warm I suppose as in '44 The contest here was very dull and no excitement at all_ The Whigs were it is true the successful party, but it remains to be seen whether they dare to <unclear>change</unclear> the policy of the late administration and repeal the wise and wholesome Laws that have sustained the government and the country in times of trouble and unusualdifficulties: <pb n="3" facs="sl333c.small.jpg"/> Let them attempt to restore their "obsolete" <gap agent="damage"/> ures or revive the policy that has so often wreck <gap agent="damage"/> them and they will at the end of four years be blown skyhigh and rowed to a point on salt river never thought navigable_</p>
            <p>But political matters now seem dull &amp; tame and I will not dwell upon them_</p>
            <p>Accept my best regards to yourself and family. Is your son William still pursuing his studies and has he chosen his avocation for life</p>
