               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from Jane Bell in Cornplanter, PA, to her mother Anne Bell in Cloverdale, TN, dated December 6, 1837.  Jane has decided to marry Mr. Bell without her parents expressed consent, although she knows they do like him.  She believes she will not make a very good wife because she is sickly. Even though her new family has been very welcoming, she misses her  old family and friends and says that she will always consider Clover Dale her home. She also fears that her family  will not keep in touch as much as she would like.</note>
