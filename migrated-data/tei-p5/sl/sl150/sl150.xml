               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from James Matheson in Canton, China to his uncle and Tennessee statesman George Washington Campbell, dated January 7, 1821. Matheson explains that due to the East India Company's monopoly on British trade in the far East, his stay in China is threatened.  He is thus inquiring of his uncle to appoint him Vice Consul for the United States to China, despite the fact that he is a British citizen.</note>

But there is an inconvenience attending my Situation arising from a regulation of the East India Company prohibiting our remaining in China for more than one Season <emph>in continuity</emph> and <add place="bottom, right">requiring</add>
               <pb n="2" facs="sl150b.small.jpg"/> requiring us to return every year to <name type="place">India</name>. Many of my Countrymen to avoid this have obtained Commissions from foreign powers to reside in China. The <name type="person">Prussian</name> Consul &amp; Vice Consul, the <name type="person">Austrian</name>, <name type="person">Swedish</name> &amp; <name type="person">Sardinian</name> Consuls are British Subjects, yet in virtue of their office are not considered subservient to the East India Company regulations. Could I be placed among this privileged number it would be a most important benefit to me. If  there are objections to appointing a Vice Consul for your Government an appointment to succeed  to the Office  of Consul on its being vacated by <name type="person">Mr. Wilcocks</name>would equally answer my purpose,â€” or in fact any sort of protection or Commission from the <name type="place">United States</name> or an Act of Citizenship Having thus stated my object shall only add that if it be in your power by any means to accomplish it I shall feel myself under the deepest obligation  This scarcely necessary for me to observe that pecuniary advantage in any shape is foreign to my views</p>

            <p>It would ill become me to abuse the indulgence recorded to me by intruding with a long letter and  shall only further request affectionate remembrances to all my relations  with the Compliments of the <unclear>Season</unclear> and sincerest wishes  for a long continuance of all the blessings you enjoy</p>
