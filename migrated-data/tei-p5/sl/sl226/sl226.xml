            <p>Everything looks dull here and in fact it is so where I have been— We made 35 miles yesterday pretty good— as I was detained 3 or 4 hours in <name type="place">Franklin</name>— I hope you are all well and that you will continue so—I think of you every hour in the day but the fleas used me so badly last night, I forgot almost everything else— I have no time to write from here — but will write to you from <name type="place">Pulaski</name> and also from <name type="place">Athens</name>— Give my love to all— Kiss Sallie &amp; Lou for me— with a bushel of love—</p>
