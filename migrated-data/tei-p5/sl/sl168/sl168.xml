               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a transcription of a speech given by Joseph Brown to Chief Cotetoy and other Cherokee on Jan. 11, 1814. Brown has taken eight Cherokee from Cotetoy because they are descended from an African slave woman that Cotetoy stole from Brown's father.  Brown says that he forgives Cotetoy for killing members of his family, and that he wants them to live in peace and friendship. </note>
