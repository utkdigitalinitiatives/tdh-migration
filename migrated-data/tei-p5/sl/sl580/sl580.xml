            <p>I could very much wish <pb n="2" facs="sl580b.small.jpg"/> that you could spend a day at my house__ or a week if convenient, in order that we may talk over your law business particularly the suit with <name>Walton</name>

Being in years less uncertain, it is my wish that no obligations should lie out, <gap/> case of death__ I presume you omitted to send it <unclear>by when</unclear> you last wrote to me. I therefore expect to hear from you on this subject, being the only obligation I have out in the world</p>
