               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter from Sampson Williams and John Wynne to General James Winchester, dated August 17, 1806. Williams and Wynne inform Winchester of some Bills that propose to divide Tennessee into administrative districts. They describe the details such as locations and  reactions to the idea. They  mention that some people want to call a constitutional convention. Winchester is asked if he plans on running for Congress. If so, they assure him of support.</note>
