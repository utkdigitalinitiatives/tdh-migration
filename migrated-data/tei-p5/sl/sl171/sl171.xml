               <note type="summary" anchored="true">This is a letter dated February 19, 1815, from Cherokee Agent Return J. Meigs to James Brown, a son of Colonel Joseph Brown. Meigs is advising Brown that recovering his father's slaves from Cherokee chief Coteoyetohee is threatening a peace between the US and the Cherokee and is in violation of a treaty. Meigs reminds Brown that treaties are the highest law and that all are accountable to the law.</note>
