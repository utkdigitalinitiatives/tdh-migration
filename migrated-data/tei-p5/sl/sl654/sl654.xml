            <p>I enclose to you the resolution of the Legislature of <name>Georgia</name> authorizing the appointment of an agent to negotiate with the Legislature of the State of <name>Tennessee</name> for the right of way for this State for its Western and Atlantic rail road from the Georgia line to the <name>Tennessee River</name> through the territory of Tennessee. General <name>Daniel Newman</name> is the agent the State appointed in pursuance of the resolution of the Legislature.</p>
            <p>The objects to be accomplished by the construction of the Western and Atlantic rail road are so great and so equally important to the states of Georgia and Tennessee that it is hoped that the Legislature of Tennessee will find no difficulty in granting to Georgia the right to construct its rail-road from the line of the state to the Tennessee river through the territory of Tennessee. May I ask of your Excellency to present this subject to the Legislature for its consideration in the most favorable light and that you will give your assistance to the agent of this State in accomplishing the object of his mission.</p>
