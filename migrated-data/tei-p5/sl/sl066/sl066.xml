In the letter, Sumerall informs the merchants of the conversation that took place between himself and a Mr. Hunt in Lexington, Kentucky pertaining to the service of cotton baling that Hunt was going to perform for the men. Sumerall states that he gave his oath to Hunt that the men are good for the money that is required to pay for the cotton baling.</note>
