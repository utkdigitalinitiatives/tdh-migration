Jackson in Hendersonville, Tennessee.  Daniel writes mainly about personal financial matters, and explains that he has sold his farm and is in search of another one either in Florida or Mississippi.  He also beseeches Andrew to welcome and assist a Cumberland Presbyterian minister who will be seeking the position of Chaplain to Congress.  </note>
