In this letter, Claiborne discusses politics, particularly the democratic presidential campaign to elect James K. Polk in 1844.  Claiborne reports on how the democratic ticket is faring in states throughout the country and in the counties of Tennessee in particular.  He is hopeful that the democrats will win out in Tennessee.</note>
