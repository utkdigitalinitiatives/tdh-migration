                        Governor Willie Blount dated December 7, 1813 to an unknown military
                        commander. He is explaining that he does not know how long the term of
                        service for a local detachment of men is supposed to be. He also regrets the
                        lack of supplies for the soldiers. Much of the letter discusses the
                        movements of Creek, Choctaw, and Chickasaw forces; and of various US
                        military generals and colonels.</note>
