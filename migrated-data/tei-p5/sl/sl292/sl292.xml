The document is torn concealing its author, but he identifies himself as an "old friend" of Fergusson's who was at the time living amongst the Seminole Indians where he was conducting business.  The author also discusses political affairs, particularly the condition of the Democratic party, and the recent death of Andrew Jackson.</note>
