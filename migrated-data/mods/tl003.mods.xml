      <title>[Letter] 1803 June 9, Knoxville, [Tennessee], [to] Henry Dearborne, [i.e. Dearborn], Secretary at War / Archibald Roane, Governor of the State of Tennessee</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter written on June 9, 1803, by Tennessee Governor Archibald Roane (1801-1803) to Secretary at War Henry Dearborn. In the letter, Roane informed Dearborn of a road in Tennessee which was believed to be inhabited by bandits who had been attacking travellers. It was unknown if the bandits were Indians, white men, or both. Roane offered some suggestions concerning the insurance safety of the travellers, including offering a reward to induce the Indians to help catch the culprits. Roane expressed concern that if it were discovered that the bandits were from an Indian tribe, relations between the Indians and whites in the region would deteriorate.</abstract>
