      <title>[Photograph of the posthole pattern of a Cherokee segmented domestic structure ca. mid-18th century at the town of Tomotley, taken in 1976] / [by Gerald F. Schroedl]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a photograph of posthole patterns of a Cherokee segmented domestic structure at the town of Tomotley in the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley. This structure dating back to the mid-18th century, although rectangular, appears to be more substantial than the typical summer dwelling. These sturdier structures that were often partitioned were discovered in Tomotley and Mialoquo in groups at angles to one another. It is a pattern similar to site patterning among the Creeks and Lower Cherokees and may reflect the presence of refugees settling in the Overhill country. Excavations of Tomotley were conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1976 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</abstract>
