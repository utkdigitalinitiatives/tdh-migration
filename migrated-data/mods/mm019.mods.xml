      <title>[Drawing depicting Cherokee townhouse and summer pavilion posthole patterns at mid-18th century Tomotley, created in 1976] / [by Marion Drescher]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a drawing of posthole patterns dating back to the mid-18th century of a winter townhouse (top) and summer pavilion (below) from the Overhill Cherokee town of Tomotley. All political and social events were held in these townhouses. The winter townhouse was a large conical structure, which contained amphitheater seating around a central hearth. The rectangular summer town or council house was an open pavilion suitable for warm weather. Excavations of Tomotley were conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1976 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</abstract>
