      <title>[Hand drawn map detailing Battle of Horseshoe Bend] 1814 May 15th, Rhea County, Tennessee</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a hand drawn map of the battle that occurred at Horseshoe Bend on March 27th, 1814. Led by General Andrew Jackson, the United States regular army, the Tennessee militia, Cherokee and Lower Creek Indians fought against the Upper Creek Indians at Horseshoe Bend, in present day Alabama. Over eight hundred Upper Creeks were killed and over two hundred women and children were captured. This was the final battle of the Creek War of 1813-1814. The Creek Indians lost almost 20 million acres of land in Alabama and Georgia in a treaty with the United States. Andrew Jackson returned to Tennessee a hero and was later elected as President of the United States.</abstract>
