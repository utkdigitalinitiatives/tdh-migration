      <title>[Letter] 1837, June 27, Clover Dale, TN [to] Miss Ann Jane Bell, Philadelphia, [PA] / Sarah Bell</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter from Sarah Bell to her sister Ann Jane Bell dated June 27, 1837. She complains that her family would not let her write to Jane because they were worried Jane would not want to pay the postage. She writes that the family has been concerned for her and that their mother wants to know what kind of medicine she is taking. Sarah updates Jane on the news from the neighborhood, sicknesses, marriages, etc. The sisters are trying to decide between a barbecue or a speech on temperance as their July 4th activities. Margaret has greatly enjoyed the book The Three Eras of a Woman's Life. They did not like Mrs. Cary's book because she thinks that all women should be punished for what Eve may have done, and the sisters do not agree. Sarah wants to be sure that Jane will send her a copy of her piece on Presentiment and her anecdote.</abstract>
