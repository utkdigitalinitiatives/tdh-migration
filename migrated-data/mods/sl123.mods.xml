   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter from Sarah Bell to her sister Ann Jane Bell dated Nov. 17, 1838. Sarah writes of her recent illness, and the death of woman from consumption. She hopes that Jane is better from her illness. She regrets not being able to visit Jane and nurse her back to health every time she is sick. Sarah writes of the repairs and improvements that are being done to the house in preparation for winter. She writes of what they have been producing on the farm. She mentions the efforts to build a church in Charlotte and of a recent camp meeting. Her favorite preacher, Mr. Marshal will be the permanent preacher now, and this pleases her very much. She includes some briefs about the neighbors, and inquiries from their parents.</abstract>
