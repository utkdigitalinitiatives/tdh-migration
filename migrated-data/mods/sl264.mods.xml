      <title>1850 July 16, Nashville [TN] [to] George [House] / Mary [House]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter dated July 16, 1850, from Mary House to her husband George House. She writes that the cholera is starting to subside in town, and who has died from it. She reports of a cousin who is badly sick, whom she wants to accompany herself, George and their daughter on a trip. She tells George that she never wants him to travel again, and to that end, she wants him to stay gone on this trip until he is completely finished, no matter how long it takes. Their daughter Sallie adds a few lines.</abstract>
