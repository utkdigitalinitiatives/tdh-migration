In his letter, Governor McMinn informed the House and Senate that he had enclosed for their consideration a copy of an agreement between the United States (by Agent William Cocke) and the Chickasaw Nation concerning the opening of a road from Reynoldsberg.

Governor McMinn stressed that the road would not only be of importance to the citizens of Tennessee, but also to those of Kentucky and Ohio.</abstract>
