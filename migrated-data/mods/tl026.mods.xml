      <title>[Letter] 1797 Jan. 12, Knoxville, [Tennessee to] Silas Dinsmore / Governor John Sevier, Governor of the state of Tennessee: a machine-readable transcription of an image</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter, dated January 12, 1797, written to Silas Dinsmore, agent to the Cherokee, from Governor John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801). The letter was written partly in response to inquiries made earlier by Dinsmore regarding Indian land boundaries in the Cumberland area. Sevier explained that Americans could begin settling in areas as low as the Tennessee River and that the settlements boundary line the government was experimenting with was going to be extended. Sevier devoted the second half of the letter to discussing problems between the white settlers and the Cherokee, by stating that several complaints had been made about robberies and plundering believed to have been committed by some Cherokees. Sevier expressed disdain toward this conduct and feared it would hinder peace. Sevier also enclosed a letter he had written to Cherokee chiefs.</abstract>
