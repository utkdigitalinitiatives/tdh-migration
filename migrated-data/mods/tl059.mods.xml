   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter written by John Sevier, Governor of Tennessee from 1796-1801 and 1803-1809, to Colonel Joseph McMinn, Colonel Samuel Wear, and Major John Cowan, dated August 9, 1804. In the letter, Sevier informed these men that he had received word of a meeting to be held with the commissioners of Georgia regarding a road that would be built connecting the two states, which would also run through Cherokee lands. Sevier commanded the men to attend the meeting, and he gave further instructions of the agreements to be made with the Georgian commissioners. Sevier wanted to make certain that both states would have an equal amount of work to do in constructing the road and reap an equal number of advantages from its existence.</abstract>
