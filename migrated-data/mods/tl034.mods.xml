      <title>[Letter] 1797 Feb. 17, Knoxville, Tennessee, to] Benjamin Hawkins, Superintendent of Indian Affairs / John Sevier</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter written to Benjamin Hawkins, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, from Tennessee Governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) on February 17, 1797. In this letter, Sevier accounted the story of two slaves belonging to Captain James Richardson who had run away and ended up in the Cherokee Nation. The slaves were then taken by a member of the Creek Nation, who announced he would not relinquish possession of the slaves until some of his horses stolen by Cherokees, were returned. Sevier also told Hawkins that it is suspected that Creeks and/or Cherokees had recently been exerting aggression against settlers in the Cumberland, having killed one man and stealing several horses. Sevier requested that Hawkins attempt to have the slaves and horses returned as soon as possible.</abstract>
