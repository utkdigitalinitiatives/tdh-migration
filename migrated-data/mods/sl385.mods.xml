      <title>1838 Oct. 14, St. Louis, Missouri [to] Newton Cannon, Nashville, Tennessee / Edmund Pendleton Gaines</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter to Newton Cannon, Governor of Tennessee, from General Edmund Pendleton Gaines, dated October 14, 1838. Gaines writes extensively about his proposal to build a series of canals, turnpike roads, and railroads from the interior to the frontier. He sites evidence from the War of 1812 (which he refers to as the War of 1814) and European wars as to why these avenues are necessary. He offers several complaints against the existence of political parties and their detrimental effects to the United States. He writes about the importance of steam powered engines. Gaines is very concerned with protecting the borders from European and Native American nations combining their forces against the United States.</abstract>
