      <title>[Photograph of the posthole pattern of a Cherokee townhouse at the former site of the mid-18th century Cherokee town of Toqua, taken in 1977] / [by Robert D. Newman]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a photograph of the posthole pattern of a Cherokee winter townhouse at the former site of mid-18th century Toqua. Winter townhouses were cone-shaped and appeared to look like small mountains from a distance. Townhouses were used for all public, social, and political events. Some were large enough to hold 500 people. The seats were arranged like an amphitheater with the seats rising one above another, leaving an area in the center for a fire. Excavations were conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1977 in anticipation of the flooding of the lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Jefferson Chapman. Field Director, Robert D. Newman</abstract>
