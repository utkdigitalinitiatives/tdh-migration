      <title>[Letter] 1821 May 6, [to] R.E.W. Earl, New Orleans / A.J. Donalson</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter from A.J. Donalson to R.E.W. Earl dated May 6, 1821. In the letter, Donalson speaks of the hospitality of the citizens of New Orleans toward himself and his troops while they have been there. Donalson awaits information from Colonel Forbes on whether or not he has reached Pensacola, carrying orders to Cuba for the surrender of Florida to the United States. He states that after the information is attained, he will march to Pensacola as well and that troops will soon take possession of St. Augustine. Donalson states that people are moving from all parts of the country to Pensacola and that it has the potential to become a great commercial city. He concludes by asking R.E.W. Earl to finish the portrait of Donalson that he started and present it to his mother when it is completed.</abstract>
