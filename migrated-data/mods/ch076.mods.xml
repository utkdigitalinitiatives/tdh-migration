      <title>Opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1831 Jan. / delivered by Chief Justice [John] Marshall on a motion of the Cherokee Nation for a writ of injunction and subpoena against the State of Georgia</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a copy of the official opinion of the Supreme Court of the U.S., delivered by Chief Justice John Marshall, on the motion filed by the Cherokee Nation for an injunction against the state of Georgia. The Cherokees sought the opinion of the court on the issue of Georgia's right to extend its jurisdiction over the Cherokee Nation, effectively depriving them of their sovereignty. Marshall's decision here indicates that the Cherokees cannot be strictly considered foreign nations, as they had argued, and are instead considered "wards of the state," or "domestic dependents." This decision was delivered in the January term of 1831 and is of extreme significance in the development of Indian Removal issues.</abstract>
