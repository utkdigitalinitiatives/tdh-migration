      <title>1843 Mar. 13, Nashville [TN] [to] Mary House, Russellville, Kentucky / George House</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter from George House to his wife Mary House, dated March 13, 1843. He is upset that she does not want to write to him more often. He writes that he will not go to Alabama as it would increase the distance between them. He writes about seeing the Great Comet of 1843. He mentions that astronomers have predicted another comet will also be visible soon. Because the comet which became known as the Great Comet of 1843 was unknown and unexpected, he believes the Millerites will make something of it. Finally, he gives some local news.</abstract>
