      <title>[Photograph of the posthole patterns of a mid-18th century Cherokee townhouse at Mialoquo, taken in 1977] / [by Gerald F. Schroedl]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a photograph of posthole patterns of a winter townhouse dating back to the mid-18th century at the Overhill Cherokee village of Mialoquo. Overhill townhouses were situated in a common village plaza. There was generally a winter townhouse, which was a large circular dome in which a fire could be built in the center and an adjacent rectangular open pavilion for summer use. Both were used for public social and political activity. Excavations of Mialoquo were conducted by the University of Tennessee in 1977 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Jefferson Chapman. Field Director, Gerald F. Schroedl.</abstract>
