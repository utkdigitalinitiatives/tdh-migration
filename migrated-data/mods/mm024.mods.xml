      <title>[Drawing depicting a Cherokee townhouse at Chota] / [by Thomas Whyte]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a drawing of an Overhill Cherokee winter townhouse at Chota. Winter townhouses which were cone-shaped appeared to look like small mountains from a distance. Some were large enough to hold 500 people. The seats were arranged like an amphitheater with the seats rising one above another, leaving an area in the center for a fire. The drawing is based on historical descriptions as well as archaeological excavations conducted by The University of Tennessee from 1969-1974. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Directors, J. Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F. Schroedl. The drawing is by Thomas Whyte.</abstract>
