      <title>[Photograph of small pit filled with charred corn cobs, 18th century Cherokee Village of Tanassee, taken in 1972] / [by J. Worth Greene]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a photograph of a small pit filled with charred corn cobs used to smudge ceramic vessels or to process deer hides at the Overhill Cherokee Village of Tanasee (Tanasi). Tanasee is sometimes referred to as Chota-Tanasi as the two towns were very close together. Chota and Tanassee were two of over 60 Cherokee settlements in the Southeastern states during the 18th century. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal Investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J. Worth Greene.</abstract>
