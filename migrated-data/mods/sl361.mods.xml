   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter dated January 31, 1837. It is Rev. Finis Ewing from Rev. James Smith. Smith is travelling and relates the state of the Cumberland Presbyterian churches he has visited. He is very upset and disheartened. He writes that the Methodists are making converts, and that many of the churches lose so many members that the are no more. Smith is upset that there are many in the church with differing theologies. He describes the unorthodox beliefs of some. Smith is worried that heresy will take over the church. Smith mentions that this trip has been bad for his business at home, and that he has been borrowing money from different people.</abstract>
