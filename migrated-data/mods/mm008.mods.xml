      <title>[Painting depicting a Cherokee farmstead in the mid-18th century] / [by Carlyle Urello]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This photograph is of a painting of a mid-18th century Cherokee farmstead. The painting was based on historic descriptions and archaeological excavations from the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley, conducted by the University of Tennessee 1967-1982. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee Villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).</abstract>
