      <title>[Drawing of posthole pattern of Overhill Cherokee townhouse, summer pavilion, and large pit-features at Chota] / [by Marion Drescher]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This photograph of a drawing shows the posthole patterns of a Cherokee townhouse, summer pavilion, and large pit-features at Chota. Townhouses, or council houses, were large circular dome structures that served as an arena for all political and social events. The summer pavilion, which was open and rectangular in shape was used for the same purpose during warmer weather. Pits were dug for burials and for storage of refuse. The drawing is based on historical descriptions as well as archaeological excavations conducted by The University of Tennessee from 1969-1974. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Directors, J. Worth Greene, Duane H. King, and Gerald F. Schroedl.</abstract>
