      <title>[Letter] 1797 Jan. 17, Knoxville, [Tennessee, to] Sec[retar]y of the Department of War / John Sevier, Governor of the state of Tennessee</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter written by Governor John Sevier of Tennessee (1796-1801) to Secretary of War James McHenry, dated January 17, 1797. Sevier reported that the companies of Captains Wade and Sparks had arrived, but were incomplete. He requested three companies of infantry and a troop of cavalry be sent as well in order to protect the frontier settlers and scare the Indians. Sevier also informed McHenry that several families had their horses stolen and wagons plundered along the Cumberland road, and he had written to Cherokee chiefs and their agent to prevent such acts. Sevier ended his letter by claiming that he would endeavor to prevent encroachments upon the hunting grounds of the Indians.</abstract>
