      <title>1808 Mar. Mar. 3, Georgetown [Virginia, to] Gabriel Duvall / David Henley</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter from David Henley to U.S. Comptroller of the Treasury, Gabriel Duvall, dated March 3, 1808. Henley has apparently been accused of owing money from his time spent as an agent for the War Department in Tennessee (formerly the Territory Southwest of the Ohio River.) This letter is explaining in detail his time there. Henley mentions many of the people he worked with. He explains how hard he worked and how little his pay was, comparing his job and salary to other's. He defends his actions, pleads for justice, and promises to pay some of the money back.</abstract>
