      <title>1836 Aug. 28, Camp Sabine [Texas] [to] Newton Cannon, Nashville, Tennessee / Edmond P. Gaines</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter from Major General Edmond P. Gaines to Newton Cannon, governor of Tennessee. It is dated August 28, 1836. Gaines is in charge of protecting the Western Frontier of the United States from attack by Mexicans and Native Americans, who are fighting the Texans. Gaines' request for more gunmen has been refused by President Jackson. Gaines writes an apology to Cannon for any embarrassment this occurrence may have caused him, though Gaines still thinks he is right about needing the extra men to repel a major assault from the Natives, which he feels will be inevitable when the Mexican army crosses the Brazos River in western Texas. Gaines is very concerned about not being able to protect the settlers in the Disputed Territory from a massacre, since something similar happened in East Florida. Gaines also complains that the people in the interior, who are influential and educated, do not care about the welfare of the frontier families.</abstract>
