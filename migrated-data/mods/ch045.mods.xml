      <title>[Letter], 1831 June 10, New Echota, Cher[okee] Na[tion] to George R. Gilmer, Governor of Georgia / S[amuel] A. Worcester</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Letter dated June 10, 1831 from Samuel A. Worcester, Christian missionary living in the Cherokee Nation, to Georgia Governor George R. Gilmer in response to a letter Worcester received from Gilmer. Worcester received Gilmer's letter through Colonel Sanford and is informed by Sanford that he is liable to arrest if he has not removed within ten days. Worcester defends himself against accusations made by the governor, contending that his goal is to stimulate the spiritual growth of the Cherokee people and not to revolt politically against the state. He explains why he cannot in good conscience take the oath of Georgia and describes his progress in translating Christian texts into Cherokee. Worcester is determined to remain with the Cherokee until he is forced to move. Elias Boudinot, editor of the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper is mentioned.</abstract>
