      <title>[Photograph of mid-18th century gunflints, musket balls, and lockplate recovered from Chota, taken in 1967] / [by George Fielder]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This photograph is of gunflints, musket balls, and a lockplate, all of which were mid-18th century trade items of the Cherokees found in archaeological excavations of Chota in what is today Monroe County. Chota was recognized by Europeans as well as other Indians for its powerful economic influence and was regarded as the capital of the Cherokee nation. Excavations of Chota and other Overhill villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).</abstract>
