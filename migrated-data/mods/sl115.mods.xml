      <title>[Letter] 1838 Jan 1, Clover Dale, Ten[nessee] [to] Mrs. Ann Jane Bell, Oil Creek, Venango Co., PA / Margaret Bell</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter from Margaret Bell to her sister Ann Jane Bell dated January 1, 1838. Margaret and their mother are glad that Jane is happy in her new home, and they hope that the fresh country air will speed her recovery in a way that the city could not. She writes there are a great many weddings going on in Clover Dale. One of the grooms is the teacher at the new boy's school. There is also now a girl's school. They celebrated Christmas differently, with prayer meetings instead of parties. She writes about who has received religion and how they have changed as a result. She also reports the death of a Mrs. Gould in her post script.</abstract>
