      <title>[Letter] 1795 Sept. 29, Chickasaw Nation / Piomingo</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a copy of a letter, dated September 29, 1795, by Chickasaw chief Piomingo (indicated in this letter as Opy Omingo and Opoia mingo) that was written to General James Robertson and sent to Colonel David Henley. Piomingo wrote this letter as a plea to the United States government for assistance. Hostility existed between the Chickasaws and the Creeks, and the letter described an attack by the Creek on the Chickasaw Nation. Although the Chickasaw were able to hold off and defeat the Creek, they endured considerable losses. Piomingo urged Robertson to think of Chickasaws as the brothers of Americans and that brothers should want to help each other in times of need. The Chickasaw chief asked for troops and provisions to be sent to his nation.</abstract>
