   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter, dated February 15, 1847, written from R. M. Moore at East Tennessee University (former name of the University of Tennessee) to John D. McAdoo in Anderson County. In the letter, Moore related the ill state of his health at the time. He also wrote briefly of recent university news. A new student had enrolled, and Moore had befriended the student in hopes that he would soon join his society. Also, a student by the name of Parshall had left the school and returned home. Moore further expressed disdain for the poor performance of his hall's debate team.</abstract>
