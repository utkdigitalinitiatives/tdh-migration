      <title>[Photograph of the postholes from a mid-18th century Cherokee winter domestic house at Chota, taken in 1969] / [by George Fielder]</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This photograph shows the postholes of an 18th century domestic winter house at Chota, a former Overhill Cherokee village in what is today Monroe County. Winter houses were conical in shape with four central support posts and were generally about 30 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Adjacent to these round winter homes was usually a rectangular building used for summer habitation. Excavations of Chota and other Overhill villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J. Worth Greene</abstract>
