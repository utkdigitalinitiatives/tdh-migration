      <title>[Letter] 1795 Oct. 24, Nashville, [Tennessee to] Col[onel] David Henley, Knoxville, [Tennessee] / J[ames] L. Robertson</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter written by General James L. Robertson to Colonel David Henley of Knoxville, dated October 24, 1795. In the letter, Robertson warned Henley about the Creek Indians, who, although they appeared to be seeking peace with the United States and neighboring tribes, had been instigating hostilities with the Chickasaw Indians. Robertson described a battle between the two tribes, which he stated was initiated by a Creek offensive, yet concluded by a Chickasaw victory. Robertson explained that the attack would prevent the Chickasaws from hunting, which in turn would require the US government to send more provisions. The letter concluded with Robertson offering Henley a proposal to purchase land. Enclosed with the letter was a copy of a letter written by Chickasaw chief Pioming (referred to by Robertson as Opiomingo), which further described the Creeks' hostility and asked for assistance from the US government.</abstract>
