   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter dated June 27, 1842 from Thomas Barry near Gallatin, Tennessee to his state governor James C. Jones in Nashville. In the letter, Barry resigns his seat in the state legislature as a representative of Sumner County. He tells the governor that he feels it is his duty, as well as that of his colleagues to resign in order to bring the matter of state districting to a conclusion. In the second page, labeled "private," he discusses proposing a law to compel banks to receive their own notes for their debts.</abstract>
