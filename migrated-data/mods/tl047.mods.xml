      <title>[Letter] 1798 July 4, Knoxville, [Tennessee, to] Alfred Moore, George Walton, and John Steele / John Sevier</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter written by Tennessee governor John Sevier (1796-1801, 1803-1809) , dated July 4, 1798, to Alfred Moore, George Walton, and John Steele. Moore, Walton, and Steele were United States commissioners responsible for forming a treaty between the U.S. and the Cherokee Indians. In the letter, Sevier informed the men that James Robertson, James Stuart, and Major Lachlan McIntosh had been appointed as agents to represent the interests of the state of Tennessee in the insuing treaty. Sevier stated that the state agents would do all that is in their power to aid the commissioners in extinguishing the Cherokee claims. Sevier explained that state agents were necessary because of their connections with the region at hand, and thus, they could better represent the interests of the people there and could prove advantageous to the negotiations.</abstract>
