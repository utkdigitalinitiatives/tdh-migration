   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a letter, dated April 13, 1803, written by Archibald Roane, Governor of the State of Tennessee, to the citizens of Anderson County, Tennessee. Roane intended to address this letter to the citizens who were presently residing on lands that had been guaranteed to Indians, and he warned them that prosecution would be brought against them if they failed to remove themselves. Roane stated that the Indians were demanding their rightful land, and the federal government would comply with those demands, be it by legal prosecution, removal by troops, or both.</abstract>
