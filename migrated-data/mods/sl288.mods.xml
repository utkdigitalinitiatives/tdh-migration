      <title>1850 Feb. 3, Nashville [TN] [to] A. J. Donelson [Jr.] / A. J. Donelson</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This is a letter from Andrew J. Donelson to his son of the same name, dated February 3, 1850. Donelson writes that he was upset by a false report that Andrew Jr. had been killed by Indians. Donelson has just returned from Germany, where he was serving as ambassador, and reports that his home and financial situation are better than he had hoped. He writes that he is worried about Andrew Jr. and that he is going to speak to a colonel about some vacation time for his son. Donelson hopes that being in danger will make Andrew Jr. a better man but regrets that he has chosen a dangerous career.</abstract>
