      <title>Gen[eral] Jackson's Farewell Address, Together with His Proclamation to S[outh] Carolina, printed 1850, Harrisburg [printed by] J. M. G. Lescure</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>This document is a booklet, printed by J. M. G. Lescure in 1850, which includes President Andrew Jackson's Farewell Address and his Proclamation to South Carolina. The Farewell Address was given on March 4, 1837, as Jackson prepared to retire from the presidency and from public life in general. In the address, he discusses his presidency's contributions to the nation, as well as his opposition to the national bank and nullification. The Proclamation to South Carolina was written on December 10, 1832, in response to an earlier decision of the state legislature of South Carolina to nullify a recent tariff bill passed by the federal government. Jackson severely chastises the insistence that states are sovereign and have the right to nullify federal laws, and he accuses South Carolina of trying to disrupt the Union and transgressing the Constitution.</abstract>
