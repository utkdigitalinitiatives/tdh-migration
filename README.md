# Tennessee Documentary History Migration Project #

## What ##
See [Project Notes and Plan](https://jirautk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLP/pages/58196091/Tennessee+Documentary+History+Migration+Project+Plan).

This is a TEI collection migration from P2 SGML/XML to P5.

## Notes and Errata ##
1. Notes from an old set of notes in the working directory from 2013:
   1. check `<gap>` elements.
   2. check anything else?
   3. `<p>` outside of `<table>` in `pav.xml`.
   4. what else?
2. Errata: this is a partial snapshot of incomplete work from several years ago (2013-2014). The some of the files in [scripts](original-data/scripts) are incomplete, or meant to be run as sequential shell commands (and I don't distinctly remember the context/sequence).
